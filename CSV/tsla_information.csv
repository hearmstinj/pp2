Tesla Still Hasn't Solved Its Big Supercharger Problem;4/29/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) faces a growing problem: overcrowding at certain Supercharger stations on peak travel days. The availability of a vast Supercharger network is an important selling point for Tesla, so the company must ensure that chargers are available for its customers when they are needed most.Over the past six months, Tesla has started to address this issue with a few policy changes. Earlier this week, the company made its boldest move yet, announcing plans to double the size of the Supercharger network in 2017. However, the number of Teslas on the road is rising so quickly that this move won't fix the overcrowding problems for long.makeArticleAd();The scope of the problemTo be clear, there is space available at most Supercharger sites most of the time. But some Supercharger locations tend to be more crowded than others. During peak times -- such as holiday weekends when lots of people are making long trips -- some Supercharger sites have developed unbearably long lines.With Tesla sales on the rise, overcrowding at Superchargers has become an issue. Image source: Tesla.For example, one Supercharger site in California had a roughly two hour wait on the day after Christmas in 2015. While this was an unusually bad incident, there have been numerous user reports of long Supercharger lines in the past couple of years.Even Elon Musk recognizes that this overcrowding is a real problem. Earlier this year, he called increasing Supercharger capacity a ""top priority"" for Tesla.Tesla makes some changesIn late 2016, Tesla announced two key changes designed to address overcrowding at certain Supercharger sites. First, it eliminated the lifetime free Supercharging perk for cars ordered after January 15 (or delivered after April 15). Instead, new cars will come with an annual free charging allowance of 400 kWh, good for about 1,000 miles of range. There will be a nominal fee for users who go past their allowance in a given year.Second, Tesla has implemented an ""idle fee"" of $0.40/minute. This is charged to Tesla owners who leave their cars parked at Supercharger stalls for more than five minutes after the car has finished charging.These two program changes are mainly designed to cut down on abuse. The first change addresses some Tesla owners' frequent use of local Superchargers to save a few dollars rather than charging at home. The second change penalizes people who waste charging capacity by parking their cars at Supercharger stalls for hours at a time.Tesla is cracking down on abuse of the Supercharger system. Image source: Tesla.Tesla has also added a ""live-status"" feature that allows drivers to check how busy a particular Supercharger location is in real-time. This will help Tesla owners avoid the most congested Superchargers.Growing the networkSince early 2017, Tesla has been promising further action to address long lines at Supercharger locations. According to its recent announcement, there were more than 5,000 Superchargers operating at the beginning of the year, and Tesla plans to double that number to more than 10,000 by year-end.Tesla's plan includes expanding existing Supercharger locations, building new Supercharger sites with dozens of stalls along heavily traveled routes, and building some sites closer to city centers to serve Tesla owners who can't charge at home.In California alone -- home to the highest concentration of Tesla owners -- the company plans to build another 1,000 Superchargers this year. In the short term, this should help relieve some of the worst congestion problems.Technology is the only real solutionThe flaw in the Supercharger expansion plan is that the number of Teslas on the road is set togrow at an exponential ratein the next few years -- at least if Tesla manages to hit its ambitious Model 3 production and sales targets.Based on Tesla's plan to ramp up total output to 1 million vehicles per year by 2020, there could be close to 4 million Teslas on the road five years from now, up from a little more than 200,000 today. It would be extremely expensive -- not to mention a logistical nightmare -- to add Supercharger stalls at a comparable rate. And in some congested corridors, it could be hard to find enough land to build the massive Supercharger sites that would be needed to meet future demand.Faster charging could be a potential solution, though. Tesla claims that its Superchargers can provide 170 miles of range in as little as 30 minutes. However, Elon Musk and other top Tesla executives have hinted that future Supercharger iterations will be able to reduce charging times to as little as 5-10 minutes.There are significant technical hurdles to reducing charging times so drastically. But if Tesla can pull this off, it would be a huge coup. First, faster charging times would make Supercharger use far more convenient. Second, by reducing the time needed to charge, Tesla could provide any given amount of ""peak"" capacity with a fraction of the Supercharger stalls it would otherwise need.If Tesla can reduce charging times while rapidly adding Superchargers over the next few years, it just might be able to keep ahead of the expected growth in charging demand. But based on its aggressive Model 3 launch schedule, Tesla will need to move quickly. Otherwise, it risks disappointing hundreds of thousands of customers with long Supercharger wait times on future holiday weekends.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Semi: New Image, and Everything We Know;4/28/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) first shared its plans to build a semi last   summer, when CEO Elon Musk laid out the company's ""Master Plan,   Part Deux,"" which detailed the 10,000-foot view of the company's   vision coming years. And Musk confirmed earlier this month that   Tesla wouldunveil a ""next-level"" semi in September.Tesla's vision for the Semi has mostly remained a secret. But   Tesla finally shared a few tidbits about the vehicle on Friday,   including a teaser image of its front.Image source: Electrek. Used with permission.makeArticleAd();What we know about the Tesla SemiNew information about Tesla's Semi is coming out of CEO Elon   Musk's TED talk on Friday about the entrepreneur's current   projects. After sharing some new details on the latest venture,   The Boring Company (a company that will dig tunnels for   transportation underground), Musk briefly discussed plans for   Tesla Semi (viaElectrek).""The CEO also confirmed that the vehicle will be capable of   long hauls,"" Electrek said, ""which was previously uncertain due   to its expected all-electric powertrain requiring an incredibly   large battery pack in order to travel hundreds of miles with a   payload.""Up until now, all that was known about Tesla Semi is that it   would be unveiled in September, and that Tesla believed (via   Musk's Master Pan, Part Deux) the semi would ""deliver a   substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while   increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.""Musk's reference to improved safety for the Tesla Semi is   likely a nod to the company's Autopilot technology, which already   enables Tesla vehicles to operate automatically (albeit with the   requirement that drivers remain alert and ready to take over) on   the highway, even with lane changes.In addition to Tesla's driver-assist Autopilot technology for   the highway, though, Tesla said last October it is now including   sensors in all of its vehicles that will eventuallyenable them to drive autonomously-- even without a driver in the vehicle. Once the technology is   active in these vehicles, Tesla said, ""Full autonomy will enable   a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver."" While the   large sizes of semis may make autonomous driving in urban streets   difficult, Tesla is clearly interested in making driving as   low-maintenance and as safe as possible -- two efforts that could   significantly benefit semi-truck operators.Image source: author.Time to consider the implications of a Tesla     semi?With Tesla sharing more details about its semi, and as the   vehicle's unveiling approaches, investors may want to begin   considering the affects a semi could have on Tesla's   business.Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Potter, who has a $368 price target   onTesla stock, recently downgraded several truck makers as he factored in the   potential implications on the industry that a semi from Tesla may   have. Further, Jaffray said truck makers ""would be wise to stymie   their laughter"" about Tesla getting into the semi market. Jaffray   also noted that the market for semis is large enough to represent   a revenue opportunity in excess of $100 billion annually for   Tesla.While investors would be wise to begin giving a Tesla Semi   some consideration in their analysis of the company's potential,   investors should also keep in mind that Tesla is already priced   for years of rapid growth.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Sales narrowly passed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.69 billion. This is primarily due to the improvement in price and mix as well as higher pricing of third-party chemical sales partially offset by lower tire unit volume.Tire unit volumes were 40 million, down 4% from 2016. Replacement tire shipments dropped 2% while original equipment unit volume declined by 8% year over year due to lower U.S. auto production.Segment operating income dropped to $385 million in the reported quarter from $419 million a year ago. The decrease in segment operating income was due to the impact of lower volume and unabsorbed overhead, which were partially offset by favorable price and mix net of raw material costs and net cost-saving actions.The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price, Consensus   and EPS SurpriseThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price,   Consensus and EPS Surprise|The   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company QuoteSegment DetailsRevenues at the Americas segment improved 0.3% year over year to $1.96 billion.

Tesla, Inc. Earnings: What to Watch;4/28/2017;"ForTesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) first quarter, one of the electric-car   company's most closely watched metrics has already been released:   Tesladelivered just over 25,000 vehiclesduring the quarter, up 69% year over year. But there's still   plenty investors would like to know when Tesla reports quarterly   results on Wednesday, May 3.You can bet investors will be watching the quarter closely.Tesla stockhas been on a tear recently, surging more than 50% in the past   six months to new all-time highs as investors begin to give more   weight to the company's upcoming launch of its first   lower-priced, mass-market vehicle: Model 3.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Ahead of Tesla's first-quarter earnings release, here are   three areas for investors to watch.Model 3 newsOne of the hottest topics going into Tesla's first-quarter   earnings release is undoubtedly anything management says about   Model 3. With the comapny planning to launch the vehicle in July,   investors should look to see if management provides updates on   what to expect from the vehicle itself, as well as from Tesla's   production plans for the vehicle.The Model 3 is critical to Tesla's plans to grow its business.   Management expects the Model 3's lower price compared to its   current vehicles to help Tesla increase its annualized production   from a rate of about 100,000 units today to 500,000 units next   year. Further, Tesla has said it expects the Model 3 program to   see ""limited vehicle production in July and to steadily ramp   production to exceed 5,000 vehicles per week at some point in the   fourth quarter and 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in   2018.""Capital expendituresOf course, Tesla's Model 3 expansion won't be cheap. This is   why investors should check in on the company's capital   expenditures for the quarter, as well as any guidance management   provides for the rest of the year.Thanks to the capital-intensive nature of building vehicles,   management said in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter that it   expected capital expenditures to skyrocket during the first half   of 2017. Management forecasted capital expenditures of $2 billion   to $2.5 billion during this period, a big jump from Tesla's $1.3   billion in capital expenditures during the entire year of   2016.DemandAnother interesting area to watch will be any commentary on   demand for Tesla's vehicles.While Model X deliveries are still rising sharply each   quarter, Model S deliveries peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015.   Will recentprice reductionsto the starting prices of Model S help the sedan's sales move   higher again? Further, while deliveries for Model X have   continued to grow each quarter, are orders for SUV still   increasing?Data sources: Tesla's quarterly SEC filings and vehicle     delivery updates. Chart by author.Tesla typically shares updates on the trajectory of orders for   its Model S and X in its quarterly updates. So, investors can   look to this figure to get some insight into how demand for the   two vehicles is panning out ahead of Model 3's launch.As far as getting an update on demand for Model 3, investors   shouldn't count on it. Ever since Tesla generatedabout 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the   vehiclewithin about a month and a half of its unveiling, Tesla hasn't   provided investors with a new figure.Tesla will release its first-quarter results after market   close on Wednesday. In addition, the company will also host a   live conference call to discuss the quarter at 2:30 p.m. PDT.   Stay tuned at The Motley Fool for analysis of Tesla's first   quarter after the update is posted.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla's Grohmann Acquisition Has Been a Mess;4/27/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) announced in November that it was acquiring   Grohmann Engineering, a German company that specializes in   developing automated manufacturing with a heavy emphasis on the   automotive sector (Tesla was previously a Grohmann customer).   That was only Tesla's third acquisition ever, preceded by Riviera   Tool in 2015 and SolarCity, which was announced in June 2016 and   closed just days after the Grohmann announcement.At the time,Tesla saidGrohmann Engineering would become Tesla Grohmann Automation and   that founder and CEO Klaus Grohmann would remain at the helm. The   deal would ""bring Mr. Grohmann's leadership, a world-class team   and unique expertise in-house."" The goal was to ""yield   exponential improvements in the speed and quality of production,   while substantially reducing the capital expenditures required   per vehicle.""No financial terms were disclosed at the time, but Tesla's10-Kthat was filed in March revealed that Tesla paid $150 million in   cash for Grohmann.makeArticleAd();Tesla factory in Fremont. Image source: Tesla.Why Grohmann really leftEarlier this month, local media outlets reported (viaElectrek) that Tesla was moving to end Grohmann's existing relationships   with other companies, including Tesla's German automotive rivals,   in order to focus on the Model 3 production ramp. That created   tension within the local workforce, who worried that the move   would threaten job security; having a diverse set of clients made   sure there was plenty of work to go around. Local workers are now   interested in organizing with IG Metall, mirroring rising unrest   among workers stateside at the Fremont factory that want to   organize with the UAW.CEO Elon Musk has attempted to appease workers in Germany with   modest pay raises and equity compensation, arguing that Tesla   could one day potentially becomea $500 billion company, in which case that equity compensation could one day become   extremely valuable. Even if there are other ways beyond   unionization to address workers' concerns, Tesla's response in   Fremont has been less than diplomatic -- at best, dismissive, and   at worst,antagonistic.It had been previously reported that contrary to Tesla's   initial announcement, CEO Klaus Grohmann had decided to retire.   We might now know why.Reutersis reporting that Grohmann was ""ousted last month"" after clashing   with Musk over the decision to ditch existing clients. Grohmann   told Reuters, ""I definitely did not depart because I had lost   interest in working,"" but couldn't say much else due to   confidentiality agreements. That doesn't quite fit the retirement   narrative that Tesla previously offered regarding Grohmann's   departure.It's been less than six months since the deal was announced,   and less than four since it closed, but Tesla's Grohmann   acquisition is already turning out to be quite a mess.A potential risk factor?Integrating acquisitions is a difficult task in any M&A   deal, but that process is more challenging when acquiring a   company halfway across the world, since the acquirer must factor   in cultural differences along with other aspects of integration.   Musk's reputation of being a difficult leader also precedes him,   andBloombergrecently tallied up a handful of high-level departures. From an   employee morale perspective, feeling insecure about your job   while seeing your former leader leave immediately after selling   the company can't be good.The most important aspect of the Grohmann situation is whether   or not it represents a risk factor for the Model 3 ramp.   Launching its mainstream electric car is by far the most   important thing for Tesla right now, particularly with the stock   hitting all-time highs in part due to investor optimism around   the Model 3. Reuters' sources say the timeline is still on track,   and Tesla has previously said that it doesn't ""anticipate any   impact on the Model 3 timeline.""The Grohmann situation continues to evolve, and Tesla is still   hoping to commence Model 3 production in July. It's crunch time,   and Tesla needs to make peace with its workers.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Book Free Profits from the Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Stock Dip;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTodaySouthwest Airlines Co(NYSE:LUV) is down nearly 4% on the earnings reaction. We rarely see LUV down this big in one candle, so I want to simply capitalize on this opportunity. Don't confuse today's trade with my expectations of an impending rally. The way I am setting this up only requires me to choose a level low enough that it won't be tested.makeArticleAd();Source:Jerry Landers via Flickr (Modified)Fundamentally, Southwest is not expensive versus its peers, which is important since it's seen as a premier operator. Most reviews I read are complimentary of the way the company operates as a business and by how it treats its passengers.Most users of Southwest Airlines actually love flying them. So LUV stock being a successful business does not come at the expense of the user experience.Technically Idohave to worry about losing the ascending higher low trend. Often if such trends are lost, they invite more technical sellers. Furthermore, LUV has already rallied over 50% since August, which adds to this technical vulnerability.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnLastly I also have to worry about the fact that after this dip, there might be chatter of double tops.Click to EnlargeI bet that in the long term, these technical worries are balanced by decent valuations and humble analyst expectations. So I am willing to start a long position, but one that has room for error. So instead of buying the stock outright and risk my money right here, I will use options where I can build a buffer.LUV Stock Trade IdeaThe Bullish Bet:Sell the LUV Sep $45 naked put and collect per 90 cents per contract. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 17% buffer from the current price even after this dip. But if LUV falls below my strike I would suffer losses below $44.10 per share.Not all traders are comfortable selling naked puts, as it could be dangerous. For those people, I can modify the trade into a sold credit put spread to mitigate the risk size.The Alternate:Sell the LUV Sep $45/$44 which is also a bullish bet. Both trades have about the same chances of success but here my maximum risk is limited to the width of the spread and what I collect to open. The reward if successful is an impressive 15% on money risked. Compare that with having to risk $54 now and hope that LUV rallies 15% from here.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 in a personal 1on1 webinarhere.

What Does Tesla Inc (TSLA) Want to Be When It Grows Up? GM?;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), at least for a brief while there, overtookGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) as the largest U.S. automaker by capitalization after exceeding a market capitalization of $50 billion. That came amid a run that sent TSLA stock to all-time highs.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor more than a century, Detroit has been home to some of America's largest vehicle manufacturers. But that might soon change with Silicon Valley threatening to become the new Motown, even as the automobile industry continues to rely more heavily on software and other cutting-edge technologies.With Tesla, You're Paying for PotentialThe comparison between Tesla and General Motors is more stark when you look at their respective valuations. TSLA stock sports a forward price-to-earnings ratio of … well, zero (it has no earnings), but negative 112 if you're going by the loss figure, versus a thin 5.6 ratio for GM stock. General Motors is, of course, solidly profitable while Tesla has yet to find a way to generate earnings consistently.That kind of stratospheric valuation clearly tells you that investors hope that Tesla will one day grow to become as big, or maybe bigger than, General Motors. Consequently, they are willing to pay top dollar for a company whose markets, including home energy generation, are still embryonic at best. After all, General Motors sold 10 million-plus vehicles in 2016, completely dwarfing Tesla's 76,000 deliveries.The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or LessTesla investors are happy to pay for potential, and forgo the huge profits and cash flows that large automakers such as GM andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) generate.But are investors getting ahead of themselves here by expecting too much from Tesla? Is TSLA stock a disaster waiting to happen?An Expanding MarketForecasts for the growth trajectory of the electric vehicle market are currently all over the place. For instance,Bloomberg New Energy Finance(BNEF) released a report in 2016 that estimates EVs will hit 35% market share by 2045 up from around 1% currently.Goldman Sachs is, however,a lot moreoptimistic and sees 22% of the market being EVs by 2025.The Energy Information Administration has EVs at 8% of the U.S. market by 2025, which though small is still double the firm's 2016 estimate and more than 10 times its 2014 forecast. The firm believes pure plug-ins by companies like Tesla will dominate the market with hybrids only playing a marginal role.Adam Whitmore, adviser on climate change policy, observes that new technologies such as EVs generally take 20 to 30 years to reach 80% market penetration once they reach 1% deployement (where we stand currently). EV is a replacement technology, and replacement technologies tend to gain market acceptance faster than new off-the-block tech.Digital cameras took about 15 years to almost completely replace film while DVDs condemned VHS to oblivion in less than a decade.TSLA Stock Is Ahead of the CurveWhichever way you slice it, one thing is clear: EVs face a bright future. And the good thing is that Tesla is well ahead of the curve compared to rivals.Tesla has lined up Model 3 to be launched later in the year, and only GM's homely Chevy Bolt comes anywhere close in terms of popularity. GM, of course, beat Tesla to the punch by releasing the Bolt a whole year ahead of Model 3, butsales of ~6,100 units by end of Marchsuggest that it's Tesla that will have the last laugh. Tesla had 373,00 Model 3 reservations at last count, and that tally has likely not changed much.Nadella Has Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Purring Like a KittenTesla owns 30% of the U.S. plug-in market. If EVs take just 10% of the 100 million-plus U.S light vehicle market by 2030, Tesla's share will probably be around 3 million units, or 39 times what the company pushed out in 2016.That level of production would necessitate a huge infrastructure buildout, and Tesla seems to be up to the task - the company has announced plans to double its supercharger network to more than 10K by year-end and finalize locations for three more Gigafactories in the same time frame.With the EV market still so young, it might seem like a stretch to expect Tesla to one day grow as big as, or bigger than, GM.But if the Model 3 hype turns to reality, then the sky might be the limit for TSLA stock.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceDon't Be Fooled.

At General Motors Company (GM), Plenty of Bad News Hiding the Good;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bad news keeps piling up atGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM), just in time for its April 28 earnings report.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)Those numbers should provide something of a respite, with net income of $1.45 per share expected, and $1.51 hoped for,on revenue of $42.02 billion. That would be in line with the $6 per share of net income reported last year, and could even justify a hike in the 38-cent-per-share dividend.But the bears remain in firm control of GM stock, which opened for trade April 26 at a price-to-earnings multiple of 5.67 and a dividend yield of 4.5%. That's because bad news keeps raining down on the company, headlined by the U.S. Supreme Court saying it remains responsible for ignition switch faults that occurred long before its 2009bankruptcy and reorganization.How Was the Play, Ms. Barra?The bad news might remind some of the old Lincoln assassination joke, ""other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?Consider:Plaintiffs' lawyers say that GM stock's damages on the ignition switch issue could total $10 billion, nearly one-fifth of the company's current market cap.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnVenezuela seized GM's factory thereand in response GM laid off all 2,700 workers by text message. The company also has 79 dealers there employing 3,900 more people, and half the country's parts supply market.Hedge fund billionaire David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital issettling in for a ""tough fight""against the company, demanding a second class of stock to separate its dividend from its potential for capital appreciation. General Motors defended itself ina letter to shareholders about the proxy fight.Oh, andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) passed GM as the most valuable U.S. car company for a while this month.Any Good News for GM Stock?Not all the news is ridiculously horrible.While March sales in the U.S.disappointed analysts, they wereup 1.6%, to 256,444 units, and the company picked up market share. Our James Brumleycalls the company ""best of its breed.""Other analysts note that it's ""crushing""Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F) despitefewer incentivesand that February sales were better than expected, balancing out the bad news of March.China remains strong for GM stock, with March sales of 345,448 vehicles, one-third more than in the U.S., and up 16% from the same periodlast year.The company plans to launch up to10 electric or electric hybrid vehicles in Chinaby the end of the decade. Morningstar says its transformation to common car platforms is not yet complete and there ismore upside in the stock.GM is also doubling the size of Cruise Automation, its self-driving car unit in San Francisco, withplans to hire 1,100 people.The company is determined not to be left behind the moves toward self-driving and all-electric cars, where it issecond to Tesla.A Quiet Battleground for General MotorsThese cross currents make GM a quiet battleground stock, with 23 analysts split between buy and hold recommendations, and one demanding you sell the shares.Why GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Doesn't Need Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) to SurviveIf you're bullish on the company's long-term future, this might be a very good time to buy, as the shares are down 10% from the date of its last dividend payment.Warren Buffett says he's not abandoning the stock.He likes the company's plans to buy back $5 billion in shares this year, almost 10% of the current market cap.The technical indicators are paintinga bleak picture, and a lot of the news may be bad, but GM keeps selling cars in quantity, it's on top of the changes within the industry, and it could yet prove the doubters wrong.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Is a No-Brainer Buy Ahead of Earnings;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. And INTC stock, which has declined 2.5% in three months, is poised for a breakout north of $45 per share in the quarters ahead.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA Look Inside IntelIntel CEO Brian Krzanich - in his fifth year at the helm - seems intent onputting Intel's cash to use. The company's $15.3 billion acquisition of Israeli self-driving technology companyMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) was themost recent example. This deal follows a $16.7 billion acquisition forAlteraback in 2015.All told, Intel is now in the driver's seat with autonomous vehicles, thanks to Mobileye, which will allow it to better compete withTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) and Google parentAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).What's more, the company is no longer on the outside looking when it comes to smartphones. Aside from winning chip placement inApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 and possibly future iPhones, Intel continues its push in the realm of Internet of Things and in the data center market.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnKrzanich, who has found ways to get Intel's top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. He's done a solid job managing both Intel's growth and the company's costs. From my vantage point, these factors make INTC stock, which pays a 3% yield, a no-brainer buy (to steal a phrase from billionaire investor Carl Icahn). And the company's earnings results Thursday, combined with solid guidance could be the catalyst to send INTC stock higher.For the quarter that ended March, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 65 cents per share on revenue of $14.81 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 54 cents per share on $13.8 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, EPS is expected to rise 3% year over year to $2.80 per share, while full-year revenue of $59.93 billion would rise 0.8% year over year.Beyond the revenue and EPS numbers, analysts will also focus on the extent to which the Data Center Group (DCG) segment, which contains server/networking, can offset the any pressure Intel might face this quarter in Client Computing Group, which contains its PC and mobile processor business.Bottom Line for INTC StockAhead of Thursday's result, INTC stock has risen just 2% year to date, trailing the 6% rise in theS&P 500index, suggesting there's plenty of pessimism that the company, which has beaten analysts estimates on both the top and bottom lines in two straight quarters, will do so again. But with INTC stock priced at just 13 times fiscal 2017 estimates of the $2.80 per share, compared to a an 18 P/E for the S&P 500 index, these share should reach $45 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 22% returns.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeApple Inc.

Instead of relying on sales in 5G network equipment, Nokia would re-enter the smartphone space through a licensing deal withHMD Global.NOK Stock Earnings SummaryNokiareported net sales of $5.88 billion (5.4 billion euros). It made non-IFRS diluted earnings of 3 cents per share. Its diluted per-share loss of nine cents (8 euro cents) is a 3-cent improvement over last year. Nokia's network business showed a slight decline of 6% in sales. Unsurprisingly, IP and Optical Networks put a drag on results.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeMarkets already anticipated weakness in this segment. In recent days, shares ofCiena Corporation(NYSE:CIEN) andOclaro, Inc.(NASDAQ:OCLR) fell.Finisar Corporation's(NASDAQ:FNSR) weak quarterly report in March and soft outlook triggered a selloff in the sector.Nokia bucked the negative trend in the Networks sector by reporting gross margin of 39.5% in the quarter. The Mobile Networks division, along with cost-cutting measures and steps to improve operations, contributed to the solid profitability numbers.Despite any licensing deals in the quarter, Nokia's acquisition of Withings lifted net sales by 25% year-on-year. It also benefited from higher patent and brand licensing.Nokia Technologies stood out as the unit having the highest year-over-year change. Revenue grew 25% to $268.8 million (247 million euros). In itspress release, the company highlighted its Comptel Corporation acquisition. The unit expands Nokia's go-to-market capabilities, helped by a sales force that has experience in software and partner network connections.In effect, Comptel will help Nokia automate more of its network and business operations. This includes customer services and self-optimization. Comptel complements Nokia's business because the two companies worked together before.Analysis on First QuarterDespite expectations that the first quarter would exhibit seasonal weakness, Nokia bucked the trend. The cost cuts are paying off, while the Mobile Networks business is stabilizing. The company did not mention the specific smartphone initiatives. But management clearly expects sales growing in the future.To offset weakness in IP/Optical Networks and in Fixed Networks, Nokia is building its Application and Analytics business. Sales did not grow year-over-year, but CEO Rajeev Suri expects the unit will deliver improving profitability. The shift for sales from hardware to software will improve profit margin and lift overall results. Once the demand for Optical improves, Nokia's overall results will improve as well.Nokia is transition more of its business toward software. The uncertainties in the IP and Optical Networks division will potentially improve, once the communications service providers review their spending budgets for their fiscal year.In the near term, Nokia's other businesses will keep NOK stock holders content.As of this writing, Chris Lau was long NOK stock.More From InvestorPlaceThe 3 Best Mutual Funds for the Rest of Donald Trump's Presidency3 Industrial Stocks to Buy for Trump's 'Buy American' OrderThe Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hype Cycle Will End in TearsThe postNokia Oyj (ADR) Earnings: NOK Stock Bucks the Trendappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Could Be Entering an Endless Pit;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsExxon Mobil Corporation's(NYSE:XOM)biggest assets are the billions of barrels of oil it has in the ground, waiting to be extracted. That's what has had many XOM stock holders interested in the company for so many years. Of course, not all oil reserves are equal; oil in Saudi Arabia costs very little to pump, while extracting oil from shale and oil sands only makes sense when oil prices are relatively high.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules state that Exxon can only put the oil and gas reserves, which it canprofitablyrecover on its balance sheet.Whenever prices fall, XOM will have to write off oil reserves that it can no longer extract at a profit, even though it still owns the oil and could extract it if prices rose. The company must leave it in the ground, and the oil becomes a ""stranded asset"".This isn't a new concern; the Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) highlighted the risk of stranded assets in the oil industry in2013, and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, did so in2015.And XOM stock suffered the consequences in February. Low oil prices made extraction of oil from Exxon's Canadian oil sands projects unprofitable. Under SEC pressure, the companywrote down its reservesby 14% - it had spent$20 billiondeveloping these reserves, money that may be down the drain now.Could this happen to Exxon stock again? And if so, what could force the company to leave more oil in the ground?10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeFor one thing, further downward pressure on global oil prices could lead to more write-offs. But even if oil prices do not fall much lower, XOM's fossil fuel reserves face the threat of regulatory action against climate change, making it more difficult for it to produce oil.Let's examine these two threats to Exxon stock.Two Threats to XOM StockIf renewable energy and electric cars replace fossil fuels, oil may end up being left in the ground, harming oil companies like Exxon.I discussedTesla Inc's(NASDAQ:TSLA)  three-pronged attack on the fossil fuel economy inFebruary.Tesla is doing several things that threaten XOM stock. It's developing electric cars that use rechargeable batteries instead of burning gasoline. With its ""gigafactories"", Tesla is lowering the costs of batteries, which could incentivize people to install more solar panels and wind turbines, which need a place to store excess power. And Tesla plans to install ""solar roofs"" in the fourth quarter this year.Fitch Ratings sounded the alarms in October 2016 , warning of the threat electric cars posed to oil companies. Fitch warned of a ""death spiral"" as investors sell both debt and stocks from oil companies, resulting in a higher cost of capital for the industry.Are electric cars a threat to oil companies and stocks like XOM stock? Cuneyt Kazokoglu, the head of oil demand at FGE, an energy consultancy,doesn't think so.First, electric cars depend heavily on government subsidies and incentives. When these are withdrawn, demand for electric cars collapses. Second, battery technology may be improving, but it has a long way to go before it even comes close to oil in terms of energy density.Third, while the production of electric vehicles is increasing, they still make up a small share of new car sales. Fourth, even if concern over ""peak oil demand"" or ""peak car"" in the West proves justified, the demand for vehicles is projected to grow rapidly in Asia, and many of these will probably run on oil.The second risk will materialize and threaten oil companies like Exxon, even if energy prices start rising. If concern over climate change continues, governments might take further action to limit carbon dioxide emissions. This would mean that only a fraction of oil reserves could be pumped.Researchersestimateda carbon budget at 565 gigatons of carbon dioxide to 2050, while known fossil fuel reserves make up 2,795 gigatons, making 80% of these ""unburnable"".Oil companies like XOM could get around this by storing the carbon dioxide (a process known as carbon capture and sequestration), but progress remains slow .Institutional investors are concerned about oil companies. Last month,Blackrock, an asset manager with trillions of dollars under management, threatened to vote directors who ignored these risks off the boards of companies that BlackRock owns shares in.Some doubt that governments will take action to limit global carbon dioxide emissions, since developing countries like China and India need cheap sources of energy, and renewable energy still has a long way to go before it can meet these needs. And now President Trump isrolling back emissionscuts.But Trump's position on climate change may be unique among world leaders, as theSierra Club, an environmental group, claimed. And Trump is very unpredictable; talk of acarbon taxrecently surfaced, although the White House later denied it.BP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) warned in January that if oil companies think fossil fuels will be phased out, either because of new sources of energy or because of government regulations, they will pump as much as they can, causing a collapse in oil prices.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Should Dip After Earnings, And That's OKThis could trigger a ""race to the bottom"" in oil prices, they'd have the incentive toget out as muchas they could profitably extract. This is bad news for oil companies heavily invested in expensive oil projects that require a high price of oil to break even, such asoil sands and Arctic oil. Most of the oil wells where oil can be extracted at a very low cost are in theMiddle East.Bottom Line on XOM StockWhat does this all mean for oil companies like Exxon? How serious are these concerns?Some dismiss concerns of a ""carbon bubble"", asIHSdid in 2015. IHS argued that oil company valuations are based on proved reserves, and 90% of these will be used in the short- to medium-term. And a2016 studyfound that stranded asset risk is already baked into oil company valuations.It's very difficult to predict who will be right, as there are a lot of wild cards that will impact the oil industry and XOM stock. What will the demand for energy look like in ten years? How fast will progress in developing sources of renewable energy go? Will governments cut back on carbon dioxide emissions and continue supporting renewable energy? Could carbon capture and sequestration come to the rescue of fossil fuels?XOM executives will have to think about these questions and more. The further in the future this happens, the less the impact on Exxon stock today. But long-term investors should think about this too.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or Less10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year7 Best Chinese Stocks to Buy on Renewed GrowthThe postWhy Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Could Be Entering an Endless Pitappeared first onInvestorPlace."

This Auto Stock Doubled While You Were Watching Tesla;4/27/2017;"Shares of Silicon Valley car and energy innovatorTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have been on quite a run. Thanks to excitement   around the company's upcoming Model 3 sedan, Tesla's shares have   risen about 75% over the past year.Tesla gets a lot of attention from investors, and rightly so.   But somewhat under the radar, there's another auto stock that's   also been on a tear over the past year or so, and it isn't   exactly a futuristic green company:Ferrari N.V.(NYSE: RACE) .Strong sales of Ferraris V12 models, including the     GTC4Lusso, helped power better-than-expected profit growth last     year. Image source: Ferrari N.V.makeArticleAd();It took investors a while to catch on to Ferrari -- and vice   versaIt's no surprise that many investors have overlooked Ferrari,   given that its history as a public company is quite short.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) owned 90% of Ferrari and controlled the supercar   maker for decades -- but that changed in October 2015, when FCA   began selling its stake through an initial public offering.Ferrari went public at $52 a share amid excitement around its   exceptionally strong brand. But that excitement faded quickly, as   investors became concerned that the company hadno easy path to growth. Conservative 2016 guidance led to a sell-off that drove prices   down to a low of $32.00 on Feb. 11, 2016. But since then,   Ferrari's shares have been on quite a run, outpacing even Tesla's   over that period:RACEand TSLA data byYCharts. The chart shows the percentage growth of each stock from Feb.   11, 2016, through April 25, 2017.What changed? More than anything else, what changed was the   story: Investors have caught on to how Ferrari plans to generate   bottom-line growth over the next few years -- and Ferrari has   caught on to how to tell its story to investors.Ferrari needed to show investors how its profits would   growWhat discouraged early Ferrari investors was a simple reality:   Ferrari has long limited its annual sales to preserve the   exclusivity of its brand. Investors began thatFerrari sell-off in February of last year, after the company's2016 forecastanticipated a tiny 3.3% year-over-year increase in shipments, to   just 7,900 vehicles. With little growth in the forecast,   investors lost interest. (That's why investors love Tesla, with   its seemingly limitless growth potential.)Ferrari was still new to this public-company thing, but   management quickly caught on. CEO Sergio Marchionne pointed out   that limited runs of super-high-priced Ferrari models (think   seven figures) could boost profits without boosting overall sales   numbers to the point of damaging the brand. And, he hinted,   Ferrari could probably gradually boost its annual sales limit by   a few thousand cars a year without doing damage to the brand.As the year went on, investors saw those themes begin to play   out. In the third quarter of 2016, Ferrari'snet income rose 20%on a tiny 1.5% increase in shipments, thanks in large part to the   limited-run (just 200) $2.1 million LaFerrari Aperta model.The seven-figure LaFerrari hypercar sold in tiny numbers but     generated huge profits. Ferrari plans similar limited-edition     models in the future. Image source: Ferrari N.V.Ferrari's full-year 2016 results drove the stock higher still.   Ferrari's net income doubled in the fourth quarter, driving a 38%   increase to 290 million euros for the full year, on just a 5%   increase in vehicles sold. Itsguidance for 2017called for more profit growth: Ferrari expects adjusted EBITDA of   more than 950 million euros in 2017, up from 748 million euros in   2016, on sales of about 8,400 Ferraris.Marchionne thinks Ferrari can nudge that annual sales number   up to about 10,000 over the next few years, without significant   impact on its pricing -- or, put another way, while keeping   supply below the level of demand.Isn't Ferrari's stock expensive now?We've seen that Ferrari has a plan to generate significant   profit growth over the next several years, as long as demand from   the world's wealthy sports-car fans remains strong. But does that   make its stock a buy now?At first glance, Ferrari's stock is far from cheap unless   you're comparing it with Tesla. It's trading at a little over 33   times its 2016 earnings. That's ahugevaluation for an automaker. But that's not the whole story.Remember that Ferrari's forecast calls for substantial profit   growth this year. Looked at through that lens, Ferrari's shares   are trading at 27 times its expected 2017 earnings. That's still   very high for an automaker -- but Marchionne has argued that   traditional big automakers are the wrong comparison for   Ferrari.Ferrari isn't just an automaker. Its Formula One racing     team, Scuderia Ferrari, is a sports brand with a huge global     following. Three races into this year's season, Ferrari driver     Sebastian Vettel has won twice, to the delight of Ferrari's     legions of fans. Image source: Ferrari N.V.Remember also that Ferrari isn'tjustan automaker; it's also a luxury brand. On top of that, its   Formula One racing team is one of the world's most widely   followed sports teams. Taken together, there's an argument that   Ferrari deserves a valuation more in line with established luxury   brands -- despite the high fixed costs of its core automaking   business.What would that look like? Well, French luxury giantLVMH Moet Hennessycurrently trades at around 28 times its 2016 earnings, whileTiffany & Companytrades at just over 26 times last year's result.Long story short: If we accept the argument that it should be   valued as a luxury brand, Ferrari's current valuation is in the   right range.So is Ferrari stock a buy?I think Ferrari might be a buy for an investor looking for an   intriguing growth story that isn't an all-or-nothing bet. (I   don't own it myself, but I might soon.) Ferrari will never have   the upside of a moonshot stock like Tesla. But on the other hand,   as a solidly profitable company with a top-drawer brand, it   doesn't have nearly the risk of Tesla: Even if its growth falls   short of our expectations, Ferrari will still be a very valuable   company.What about auto cycles? With the big automakers, we worry   about slipping consumer demand now that the new-car cycle is   likely to be past its peak. But in Ferrari's stratospheric market   segment, that's less of a concern. Unless there's a severe global   recession, Ferrari is likely to be able to meet its sales goals   with strong pricing -- meaning that the profit growth we   anticipate is likely to materialize. And that profit growth   should outpace the growth of the overall market.Ferrari's valuation suggests that the expected growth for 2017   is largely priced in. An investor who buys Ferrari today might   need to be a bit patient. But Ferrari's profit-growth plan could   make for a fun and profitable ride over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than FerrariWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

And BIDU stock holders are expecting big things.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe official analyst estimate on earnings is 86 cents per share, on revenue of $2.32 billion. That would represent 10% top-line growth over a year ago, but only a little more than half the earnings. But there is a ""whisper number,"" one analysts are telling their top clients, of 97 cents, which is much higher. Baidu itself said last month to expect revenue of about $2.4 billion.Anticipating good news, investors have bid up BIDU stock in the company by 8% over the last month. It opened for trade April 25 at about $180 per share and immediately gapped higher, to $183.50.The phrase ""irrational exuberance"" comes to mind, because officially there are more Baidu analysts with a ""hold"" rating on the stock than a ""buy"" rating.Baidu: The ExuberanceGoing into earnings, Baidu is making a lot of news that supports a higher price for the stock.

The company's work on AI has helped it achieve its present valuation, and the NVIDIA deal indicates it is prepared to deliver on the promise.Baidu has also sold its mobile gaming business in January - a move that gives it cash it can invest in its AI efforts.Baidu: The RealityAll these smart moves do little to change the company's numbers in the near-term.This could be like Amazon three years ago, when it was trading under $300 per share, but only if Baidu delivers. The difference is that bears were stalking Amazon then. They are not being heard about BIDU stock now.The smart moves also don't change the reality of an overheated Chinese market, with private debt piling up quickly, and a $10 trillion national debt equivalent to U.S. levels many analystsfind worrisome.Baidu itself does not have a debt problem, with only one-quarter of its assets subject to debt, but that is because the company's market cap of $64 billion is so huge, representing almost seven times its annual revenue.

Can Ford Motor Company (F) Stock’s Earnings Shift It Out of Reverse?;4/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Donald Trump rally has been in the rearview mirror forFord Motor Company(NYSE:F). But then again, it has been a long slog for the beleaguered shares. For the past five years, Ford stock has posted a roughly 1% return.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn the meantime, other auto makers have left the company in the dust. During the past half-decade,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) is up about 44% andToyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM) has gained 35%. Then there is the speed demon,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), which has returned a staggering 846%. Of course, the company has a market cap that exceeds the value of Ford stock.So yes, it is understandable that shareholders are not feeling so good. Although, whenever there is widespread bearishness, there could be a contrarian opportunity, right?Perhaps so. But I wouldn't put too much money on it (or any money on it!), as the Ford earnings for the first quarter, scheduled to be reported on Thursday, are probably not going to be too inspiring. The Street is looking at an 1.6% decline to $34.7 billion and earnings of 36 cents a share, down from 68 cents a share for the same period a year ago.The Mixed Picture for Ford StockNow, there are some silver linings. Let's face it, Ford knows how to build top-quality trucks that gin up tons of demand. Keep in mind that the F-Series is the best-selling truck for the past40 years.The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or LessYet the issue - which has dogged F stock for some time - is that the company cannot seem to move beyond this. Then again, the company must deal with intense competition and does not have the kind of scale of mega operators.Interestingly enough,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE:FCAU) CEO Sergio Marchionne has recently noted that an automaker needs to sell15 million vehicles per year to remain viable. However, as for Ford, it produced 6.65 million vehicles last year.If anything, Ford has become a niche player. This has meant that the company has really been playing catch-up. This has been the case with the moves into China, which have struggled. In the latest quarter,sales plunged by 21%.But the lack of scale could prove a problem with Ford's moves into next-generation technologies. While it's true that the company has made some encouraging moves - such as with a $1.2 billion investment in Canada for an R&D facility, which involves hiring 400 engineers fromBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) - these investments are likely to be relatively small. The fact is that TM, BMW, GM and TSLA have much larger capital bases to push their own efforts.It also does not help that tech companies likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Uber,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) are driving up the costs for hiring and M&A.Bottom Line on Ford StockF stock is likely to feel the pressures of a slowing in auto sales. For example, in March there was a1.6% drop to 1.55 million vehicles.Buy Boeing Co (BA) Stock on This Post-Earnings DipKeep in mind that this could be more than just a blip. If anything, the market may be moving into a cyclical downturn. After all, auto sales have seen strong growth over the past seven years, which included two consecutive records. So it does seem reasonable that there will be a cooling off period.Granted, Ford stock is trading at an attractive valuation, with the price-to-earnings ratio at a mere 10X. But of course, a stock can languish at a low valuation for a prolonged period of time, especially when there is intense competition and slowing customer demand.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookas well asOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools & services for employee stock options of pre/post IPO companies.

A Fund That Bought Tesla for Less Than $30 a Share;4/25/2017;"Primecap Management Company is an under-the-radar adviser that doesn't talk to the media. But it did something no other tracked fund did: it bought Tesla for less than $30 a share in 2011 and hung on to it through the stock's explosion this year. That's an estimated gain of 469%.Primecap advises the Odyssey Funds, which consist of a stock fund, growth fund and aggressive growth fund. Its investment profile reads like that of most typical value advisers, looking to uncover undervalued stocks whose fundamentals will develop beyond Wall Street's expectations. With a long-term approach, the managers identify changes in a company that could increase value in three-to-five years, such as new products or management, and then wait.Jack Bogle, founder of $2.3 trillion firm Vanguard Asset Management, kicked off Primecap in 1984 with $100,000 initial capital. Little information about Primecap's portfolio managers exists, but Theo Kolokotrones, a Primecap founder, is chairman of Primecap Management and co-CEO of Primecap Odyssey Funds, a role he shares with Joel Fried and Alfred Mordecai. In addition to the Odyssey Funds, Primecap manages Vanguard's Primecap Fund, Primecap Core Fund and Capital Opportunity Fund.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Their Tesla investment started back in 2011, when the fledgling brainchild of science wizard Elon Musk was coasting above its IPO price of $17, at an average in the second quarter of $27 per share. Musk's Silicon Valley team had begun selling its first electric car, the Tesla Roadster, in 2008. Primecap invested as the company was preparing to launch the world's first premium electric car, the Model S, in 2012. The new model could spring from zero to 60 miles per hour in five seconds and won Motor Trend's 2013 Car of the Year award, competing with stalwarts like GM (GM) and Honda (HMC).The launch of the model S also ignitedTesla's share price, but not before Primecap could increase its holdings from 65,000 shares originally to 2,041,090 shares by the end of 2012, at average quarterly share prices of no higher than $32 each. Tesla's share price doubled in each of the proceeding two quarters, to $75, and then to $148.Primecap took some gains from the holding as Tesla's price continued to soar but still held 1.02 million by the third quarter of 2016 before making another successful move. Managers increased the position by almost 15% as shares sank to $197 in the fourth quarter, their lowest price in three years.Year to date, Tesla's rocketed a further 47%, closing at $312.17 per share, rounding out Primecap's almost five-fold gain over five years.Other funds have cashed in on Tesla, though to a lesser degree.Ron Baron(Trades, Portfolio), founder of Baron Funds, who owns the biggest percentage of funds tracked at 0.96% of outstanding shares, started participating Tesla in early 2014 for around $200 per share. His average price for all of his share purchases is $217, for an estimated gain of 43%.Yet, Baron has declined to leap at media appearances to ""take a victory lap"" for the investment, he said in his first-quarter shareholder letter this week, saying it was ""too early for us to claim victory.""""In fact, we think it will still be too early in 2020 or 2021 when we think Tesla could sell one million cars per year, produce $70 billion in revenue and more than $7 billion in operating profits before reinvesting in its business to grow several times larger,"" he said.

"Why Does Everyone Keep Calling Tesla a ""Car Company""?";4/25/2017;"In this segment fromMarket Foolery, producer and host Mac Greer,Million Dollar Portfolio's Matt Argersinger, andSupernovaandRule Breakers' Aaron Bush dip into the Fool mailbag and find a listener     confused about whyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is so often reduced in people's minds to merely     an automaker, given its solar-power and battery-making bona     fides. And he's curious how the Fools would define it.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they       have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Tesla wasn't one of       them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even       better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of April 3, 2017This video was recorded on April 19, 2017.Mac Greer:From Brian Bosak, who writes: ""I keep seeing     headlines like this one: 'Tesla Just Passed GM to Become     America's Most Valuable Carmaker.'"" Brian goes on to write,     ""What I don't fully understand is why intelligent     people keep calling Tesla a carmaker when they do so much more     than that. They could be a battery producer, technology     company, energy company. Yet they keep getting     compared, unfairly, in my opinion, toFordand [General Motors] when it comes to market cap. It feels a bit like callingApplea phone company and comparing them toMotorolainstead ofMicrosoftor Google. If you had to call Tesla a 'blank' company, what     would you call them, and to whom would you compare them?""Aaron Bush:I would say Tesla is a vertically integrating     energy-conscious car company. It's a car company,     OK? [laughs]Matt Argersinger:With several big adjectives in front of it.Bush:It's a car company. Yeah, I think, at the end of the     day, it really is a car company. We were talking before, Apple     is a phone company. I do think you have to look at what it     is that they're selling, and it is cars. That said, I do     think there's a danger in comparing here. I personally     don't want to compare Tesla to anyone, literally anyone. My     thinking here stems around the fact that there are two types of     evolution. There's gradualism and there's punctuated     equilibrium. Those are fancy terms, but the latter category,     which, you could say, in business-speak, those are     the companies that create a new industry, or radically change     an existing industry. They should not be compared to     the incumbents, because the market is     forward-thinking and because they are changing the rules     of the game and will look different at some point in the     future. And investors who try comparing what's new with what's     old, which is a classic innovator's dilemma, are going to miss     out on the underlying story there.Greer:Punctuated equilibrium.Bush:There you go, science lesson for the day.Greer:It sounds like a medical condition.Argersinger:I think Aaron nailed it on the head. I just think, for     now, if Tesla is going to be generating 90% of its     revenue, roughly, from cars, and SolarCity is     getting integrated this year, it's still going to be 90%     revenue from cars. Apple, some 70% revenue from phones. That's     the prime product. Now, that can change over time. Amazon,     I don't think it's fair to call Amazon a retail company     anymore. You could have called them an online retail     company five years ago, but now, because of the diversity of     the business, you can call Amazon something different. But for     now, where is the revenue coming from? Where is the beef     made?Greer:OK. Sorry, Brian, it sounds like, for now, still a car     company.Bush:Tesla is Tesla.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The     Motley Fool's board of directors.

Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Is a China-Powered Buy at Fresh Highs;4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChina is a tough nut to crack for U.S. technology companies. Due to strict content restrictions, companies likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) have all been left out. However, NFLX stock is rallying Tuesday on news that the company has found a way in.makeArticleAd();Source:Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)China boasts a population close to 1.4 billion people. In a technologically driven consumption economy, this is equivalent to a gold mine for some companies.Luckily for Netflix, it could be as well. That's why when I read the news this morning, I was shocked that NFLX stock was only up about 1%.That's no longer the case, of course. Netflix shares have rocketed higher by more than 6% in Tuesday's midday trading. Shares have also hit new all-time highs of $152.57 (and counting).Better still: More gains could be on the way.First Though, What's Up With This Netflix Deal?Before we get to the stock price, let's take a closer look at this deal.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeNetflix didn't just gain entry into China overnight. There's no way that would happen - the regulatory hurdles are too high. But by partnering with a Chinese company in the form of a licensing deal, Netflix has gotten its foot in the door.Netflix has teamed up with iQIYI, a streaming platform owned byBaidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU). For its part, BIDU stock is up about 4% on the news. And just because iQIYI may not be a platform we're all that familiar with, don't underestimate its size. It currently boasts about500 million monthly active users.It's too early to speculate what content will be available or when the deal will go into effect. But it's reported that Netflix original content will be a part of it.Tuesday's Move in NFLX StockSome investors might be shrugging at this news - some certainly did this morning. But I don't think the stock is overreacting here. The financial implications may not be felt immediately or immensely. But make no mistake, gaining access to a country that's more than four times the size of the U.S. population is abigdeal.A few weeks ago, we previewed NFLX stock ahead of earnings. Given its 45% rise in just six months leading up to the report, wedeemed it too risky to initiatea new long position. Even though we expected great results, new buyers didn't have a good risk/reward setup.But I believe that has changed. While I'm always in the camp of buying into pullbacks rather than breakouts, Netflix has an interesting setup.Source: Stockcharts.comTake a look at the chart. In our previous post, we had pointed out that $147.50 had been resistance for NFLX stock. However, Tuesday's move has blasted the stock through that level. Hopefully, $147.50 will now act as support should Netflix pullback.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Faces iPhone 8 Delay as Galaxy S8 Shatters Sales RecordsThere are other positive indicators as well. Up top, the purple circle on the RSI measurement indicates NFLX is not yet overbought. Down below, the teal circle on the MACD shows that Tuesday's move now gives Netflix positive momentum. These are both bullish indicators.Traders can do one of two things:Buy now, use $147.50 as their stop-loss and look for more upside.Wait for a pullback to $147.50 to buy Netflix stock at support, should it hold.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author ofFuture Blue Chips.

General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has Lost Investors’ Trust;4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors inGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) were surprised - and unhappy - that GE stock didn't gain after the company's first quarter earnings report last Friday.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)After all, earnings came in well ahead of consensus, and organic revenue grew 7%. GE reaffirmed full-year targets for cash flow and earnings, meaning guidance was solid. And yet General Electric stock sold off, declining 2.3% and nearing a post-election low.The problem, asBarron'spointed out, is that General Electric, and GE stock, both have acredibility problem. Cash flow numbers came in well below expectations, leading to a sense that General Electric's earnings are being managed somewhat. And with the company's shares back near levels seen in 1998 - and still some 40% off early 2000's highs - investors just don't have much patience left.There's good reason for that sentiment. GE continues to zig when it should zag. It ramped up finance exposure ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. It entered oil and gas ahead of the bust there; it's still waiting for approval of its merger withBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI). Investors simply don't trust General Electric.That needs to change - but it will take some time, if it happens at all.Cash Flow, Not EarningsThe headline concern coming out of General Electric earnings was the company's operating cash flow figure. GE burned $1.6 billion in the quarter - a full billion more than it had projected. CFO Jeffrey Bornstein said on the Q1 conference call that $400 million of the gap came from receivables, including a few large accounts in aviation and some past-due collections in the Middle East.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnBut it's a sign of trust (or lack thereof) in General Electric that investor concerns weren't assuaged by his answer. JPMorgan analystStephen Tusa, as quoted byBarron's, pointed out that cash flow and earnings have diverged for some time, driven by beneficial contract adjustments.That's a long-term problem for General Electric stock, since much of its attractiveness is coming from shareholder returns.GE pays a 3.2% dividend, for instance, and the company has aggressively repurchased shares. Those buybacks are driving much of the company's EPS growth, both at the moment and going forward. But if cash flow continues to lag earnings, those repurchases will either slow down or be financed with increasing debt.Either outcome hurts GE's potential earnings growth and the company itself doesn't appear strong enough to drive that growth on its own.Net Income, Not EPSFirst-quarter earnings growth looked strong, with non-GAAP EPS increasing 12%. But those stock repurchases meant the company's outstanding share count declined 6%. In other words, over half of that seemingly impressive EPS growth came simply from having fewer shares.In 2016, industrial operating and verticals EPS (another non-GAAP figure which excludes fluctuations from GE Capital) rose 14%; net income on the same basis grew just 4%, and adjusted operating margin in the key industrial segment actually compressed.Expectations aside, General Electric simply isn't showing enough profit growth. There's a reason why GE stock and sharesHoneywell International Inc.(NYSE:HON) have diverged so far in 2017 - and why HON stock has outperformed General Electric for some time now. The earnings performance simply isn't strong enough.And when cash flow concerns are laid on top of those relatively weak profit improvements, it's tough to turn bullish on GE shares.Bottom Line for GE StockThere's a sense that General Electric is running out of time, and investor patience. CEO Jeff Immelt clearly is in the hot seat. Indeed, our own Dana Blankenhorncalled for Immelt's removaljust two weeks ago. The big moves have been made, with much of GE Capital sold off, the purchase of Alstom's power division done and the Baker Hughes integration on the way.The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hype Cycle Will End in TearsSo there's a ""what's next?"" problem for GE.There's potential cost-cutting en route, but $2 billion (after taxes) isn't a huge number against GE's $260 billion market cap. Immelt has publicly set a target of $2 in EPS by 2018, butonly one of 18 analyststhinks General Electric can get to the number.Investors have good reason not to trust the long-term strategy here. While GE stock has performed well out of the recession, it has underperformed against Honeywell and many other major industrials. Management has re-shaped the company but it still has exposure to problematic verticals like oil and gas. It's not growing earnings that strongly and revenue growth has been choppy, at best.The reaction to the Q1 report shows that General Electric needs to change the narrative toward its shares. But it's not clear the company has the ability to do so.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade7 Healthcare Stocks With A-Rated Prospects10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearThe postGeneral Electric Company (GE) Stock Has Lost Investors' Trustappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Nasdaq Crosses 6000 For The First Time Ever: What This Means For Investors;4/25/2017;"NasdaqThe Nasdaq Composite Index, home to some of the world's largest technology and biotech companies, reached a milestone Tuesday, breaking for the 6,000 mark for the first time since its inception 46 years ago.What does 6,000 mean? Is it that different from, say, 5,780? Not really. But it presents an important moment of reflection. First and foremost is the obvious: We're in a bull market, which has now lasted about eight years since the market bottomed in the first quarter of 2009 amid the Great Recession of 2008. Investors' confidence stems from the fact that corporate earnings are on the rise, unemployment continues to fall, the housing market is still booming, and consumers (for the most part) are feeling somewhat better about their financial situation.makeArticleAd();All told, Nasdaq 6,000 -- as with when the index reached its last milestone of 5,000 in March 2000 -- says investors are in full-fledged ""risk-on"" mode. But the ""risk"" this time is founded on sound fundamentals and conservative investment principals. The fact that Warren Buffett recently double-downed on his Apple (AAPL) position near 52-week highs and bought shares of Sirius XM (SIRI) at under $5 bucks underscores how far along the market has come since Nasdaq first reached 5,000 seventeen years ago.A lot has changed since then. In 2017, compared to 2000, corporate balance sheets are scrutinized more closely and, unless your name is Amazon (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX), P/E ratios matter more now than they did when XYZ.com and EIEIO.com were selling paper earnings. These days, we can see strong revenue and profit growth from companies like Google (GOOGL) or with Facebook (FB) leading the charge.Investors have also learned a lot in seventeen years. That's the optimist side in me talking, at least. I want to think we've learned since then. Besides Apple, Amazon, and Netflix, this time the Nasdaq is also being driven by the resurgence of software giant Microsoft (MSFT), which -- thanks to its cloud transformation -- is operating on all cylinders.Ultimately, Nasdaq 6,000 was reached thanks to products like social networking, the iPhone, the cloud, online advertising, breakthrough biotech innovation, among other technologies. As with each milestone, there's the obligatory question of: ""What's next?""Nasdaq 7,000 is a matter of ""when"" not ""if."" My crystal ball says it won't take seventeen years to gain 1,000 points. The milestone will likely be reached thanks to, at least in part, autonomous cars. And this puts names like Tesla (TSLA) in the drivers seat. In that vein, another name investors should keep an eye on is Intel (INTC), which recently picked off Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY) for$15.3 billion.With innovative tech companies steering Nasdaq into the 21st century, Tuesday's milestone is merely a checkpoint on the quest to help companies create, or maximize, their value."

3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Intel Corporation (INTC), Sysco Corporation (SYY) and Raytheon Company (RTN);4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPent-up buying and a few days of good earnings have put many in the market into a buying mood again. The list of companies that snapped their respective top Bollinger Band grew even larger overnight as the geopolitical concerns around the world appear to be melting away, at least for now.makeArticleAd();Today's three big stock charts look at another batch of companies that are seeing bullish volatility breakouts as technical support and breaks above their Bollinger Bands signal short-term rallies that may turn to trends. Among the names areIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC),Sysco Corporation(NYSE:SYY) andRaytheon Company(NYSE:RTN).Intel Corporation (INTC)Is Intel playing catch-up or is it getting ready for a breakout, or both?The semiconductor leader, in size only, has been lagging the market for some time as the smaller, more nimble companies have been moving ahead in terms of performance.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnYear-to-date performance shows INTC's weakness, posting 1.5% gains compared to the rest of the market gaining 8%.From a technical perspective, Intel's trendline analysis looks somewhat healthy as many of the companies within the sector. Trading above the 50- and 200-day trendlines that are also moving higher themselves, INTC is what we refer to as a technical bull.So, what about the underperformance? Volatility is the simple word. Intel is trading like a lumbering large cap now (which it is) as the shares have little to no volatility in their daily motion. All the while, the smaller companies in the sector are leaving INTC in the dust.So where from here? Intel is getting ready to benefit from a confluence of technical support at $36.  Currently, the 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages are all converging at $36. In the meantime, yesterday's price move took the stock above its top Bollinger Band. Expect the bullish support and volatility signal to help shares rally back to $38.Sysco Corporation (SYY)The ""other"" Sysco hasn't been performing much better than the networking company as the stock has lost 4% year-to-date. That said, a turnaround appears to be in the making.SYY stock recently grabbed trendline support from its 200-day moving average. This line has been trying to give shares a boost for the last month.Recently, the 50-day entered the picture to lend a hand, which appears to be helping at this time. The stock moved above this key trendline two days ago and has now broken above its top Bollinger Band too.Fast forward to today, Sysco shares are looking at overhead resistance from the 100-day at $53.35 and from our look of the charts, that's the only thing that stands in the way of a run to $56 as the stock will pickup momentum from there.Watch for the overbought indicator to potentially slow things down, but for now SYY shares are considered a technical bull.Raytheon Company (RTN)Defense companies are coming back now that it is clear that the new administration is going to have to continue to pressure a number of geopolitical situations with proposed military action. The budget, which should be released soon, will likely show an increase in defense spending after years of cuts.Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Make It Back to the TopRaytheon shares are showing the fundamental improvements with a move back above $155 and towards new highs. RTN stock remains in technically bullish mode with the support of its 50-day trendline adding strength to the current recovery.Recent volume has shown that the traders have been holding back on engaging Raytheon stock ahead of its earnings report, but the break into new high territory will likely change that as the volatility signaled by the top Bollinger Band break will also help get the RTN bulls active again.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Healthcare Stocks With A-Rated Prospects10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeThe Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hype Cycle Will End in TearsThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Intel Corporation (INTC), Sysco Corporation (SYY) and Raytheon Company (RTN)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Fortinet Inc (FTNT) Stock Is an Attractive Buy Ahead of Earnings;4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFortinet Inc's(NASDAQ:FTNT) history of reporting strong earnings results and solid fundamentals make FTNT stock an attractive buy ahead of the firm's Q1 earnings release on Thursday, April 27, after the close.makeArticleAd();We recommend that traders build a long position ahead of earnings and sell shares over the course of April 28, the first trading session following the release of earnings results.Strong History of Earnings Results and Positive Stock ReactionEver since shares of FTNT hit theNasdaqin late 2009, the company has managed to beat analyst expectations with regard to earnings per share more than 70% of the time. In terms of revenue estimates, Fortinet has beaten Wall Street estimates 96% of the time.Shares of FTNT stock have gapped higher following the release of earnings results during 23 out of 29 of the quarters since the company's initial public offering.Recently, traders have responded positively to FTNT earnings reports, pushing shares higher over the course of the trading session immediately following earnings in four of the five previous quarters.Analyst Sentiment of FTNTOver the last three months, Fortinet stock has enjoyed a positive performance; since Feb. 2, the date of the latest EPS, FTNT has climbed from $33.18 to $38.52 on April 19. Just one day after the February report, Piper Jaffray gave Fortinet a ratings upgrade to overweight from its previous neutral recommendation. A similar recommendation had been issued by Morgan Stanley earlier in November 2016.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnRBC Capital Markets was bullish on FTNT stock after its previous earnings call; the analyst firm projected a target price of $35, which was surpassed in February and has even managed to stay above $36 since then. An even more bullish target price was assigned by investment banking firm Robert Baird in late March, from $38 to $50.One of the most recent ratings was issued by Oppenheimer, which not only reaffirmed its previous outperform sentiment but also set a $45 target price.FTNT FundamentalsWhen delving into the fundamentals of Fortinet, a very positive image begins to emerge for value investors. From its Silicon Valley headquarters in Sunnyvale, Fortinet is dedicated to providing information security products and services, particularly for large enterprises and major corporations.The company has been in business since the year 2000; since then, it has developed a hardware network firewall powered by a proprietary operating system and its very own system-on-a-chip processor. Fortinet has shipped more than 3 million of these firewall units and has secured more than 350 patents. In the final quarter of 2016, the company reported $1.3 billion in cash.When Robert Baird analysts explained their ratings and target price on FTNT stock, they noted that the company should be considered to be a major player in the information security industry along with market leaders such asPalo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) and evenCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO).It is easy to see why Fortinet is in a great environment for growth. Spectacular data breaches now make frequent headlines that often cause embarrassment for their victims.Case in point: the Shadow Brokers release of CIA exploits and hacks, which were foreshadowed by similar Wikileaks releases. As tech giants such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) rushed to fix and patch their operating systems and hackers, the information security community worried about the impact of the releases, which are surely giving malicious hackers ideas as to how they may be able to breach networks in the future.Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Make It Back to the TopInstitutional investors such asBank of the Ozarks Inc(NASDAQ:OZRK) andPNC Financial Services Group Inc(NYSE:PNC) have been increasing their positions in FTNT stock lately, and they are doing so with good reason: after all, this is a profitable company that is expected to increase its growth by 22% in 2017.Tech investors who follow the information security sector should also take note that Fortinet is augmenting its sales efforts to target providers of cloud services and major data centers.With the ongoing expansion of the cloud computing paradigm and the fact that FortiGate firewalls are more affordable than the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance, FTNT seems to have a great future ahead.As of this writing, Don Dion was long FTNT.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Once Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Can Still Make You Money;4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe performance thatAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) put on display for the last 12 months was jaw-dropping. While it's not at its all-time high now, AMD stock went from under $4 per share last April to $13 now.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFundamentally I still say that there is room for AMD and all its competitors to flourish. Our existence is becoming more dependent on technology at such a fast pace that we've given its components generic umbrella names like 'the cloud' or the 'internet of things.' These are terms that are not specific and that's because tech now casts a wide net over our lives.This is not a bad thing, especially not for companies who supply us parts to the brains of these technical trinkets.AMD is one of the few companies who should have a place at the table for years to come. Before you peg me for a perma-bull, I recently shared a tradeto short AMD with some success. But that was an idea against a specific price action set up. So today I would be more inclined to go long AMD through 2017.Click to EnlargeTechnically, AMD stock is at a two month old pivot point where $13 per share has served as resistance and support. Now it's setting higher lows, trying to recover $13 on its way to retest the highs. Having said that, this is not an obvious long entry point.To make matters riskier, AMD reports earnings soon, and for the short term, those events add a big sense of gambling to any thesis.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnSo Instead or risking $13 here and without a safety net I will resort to the options market where I can build some room for error.AMD Stock Trade IdeaThe Bet:Sell the AMD Jul $10 put naked and collect 35 cents per contract, leaving you with an 80% chance of success. If Advanced Micro Devices falls below $10, I would be put the stock and accrue losses under $9.65 per share. I am comfortable that with a 23% buffer, I can manage the short-term drops against my committed risk.I realize that selling naked puts is unattractive to a lot of investors, and for those people I can modify the trade to be a sold spread instead.The Alternate Bet:Sell AMD Jul $11/$10 credit put spread for 20 cents has a slightly smaller chances of success but amuchsmaller maximum potential loss. If successful, the spread would still deliver 25% yield on risk.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 in a personal 1on1 webinarhere. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

MSFT stock has been responding to the fact that the company is moving away from the PC business, which has been in slow decline as the world goes mobile.Meanwhile, Gartner Technology Researchreportsthat Microsoft has a 28.4% share of cloud computing platform usage, with 37% held byAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Microsoft is also trying to take on Slack by introducing Skype Teams, and will roll the cost into the Office 365 product, making it a value-add to compete with the $7 to $15 monthly fee of Slack.I have to say, I thought Microsoft's purchase of LinkedIn was beyond stupid. I just don't see LinkedIn as anything other than a resumé billboard, yet somehow enough people are paying up for this service. I personally don't get it, but hey, it should generate several billion dollars in annual free cash flow to add to MSFT's coffers.Meanwhile, Microsoft is playing around in several new areas that could prove to be very lucrative. Cybersecurity is already important, and will only get more important as time goes on, and systems get more and more complex. The area is ripe for innovation, and with all the cash MSFT has it can both develop internal solutions and acquire other companies.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockIt may not make sense initially, but AI is also going to be a big part of the company's strategy and possibly Microsoft stock. For starters, AI is going to have a lot of commercial and consumer applications. Those sci-fi movies and Iron Man's Jarvis are not really that far off, and the company seems to have both the visionary CEO and the capital to R&D the heck out of this.The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hype Cycle Will End in TearsThat will spin MSFT stock back into cybersecurity, by the way. Imagine foreign nations invading our systems with bots and crawlers and nano-spies. AI and machine learning will be able to see the attacks, and auto-create ways of battling invaders by having free rein to self-write new code.This also spins into stuff like driverless cars. It isn't just the software needed to drive the cars, but security to make sure they aren't hacked into.Meanwhile, financials are fantastic and Microsoft stock keeps appreciating. In addition, the company is judiciously growing its dividend. I think it's difficult not to look at MSFT stock as a candidate for a long-term diversified portfolio.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, a specialty lender focusing on consumer finance.

Reuters cited documents released exclusively to it by California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).For a while now, there has been tremendous speculation about Apple's autonomous car technology development efforts, which is apparently codenamed Project Titan. As usual, Apple has refrained from commenting on the matter so far as it loves to maintain secrecy regarding projects it's working on.Per latest report from Reuters, Apple's 41 page application submitted to DMV, CA, comprises a 10 page training plan that includes a document called ""Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview."" The objective of Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview is ""to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions,"" Reuters further adds. However, these documents don't reveal a lot of things, like the kind of sensors attached to the vehicles or the self driving car platform mechanism.Last week, it was reported that Apple had secured a permit to test self-driving vehicles. The permit is issued to test drive three vehicles (2015 Lexus RX450h models) with two drivers each, added DMV.Apple's Project Titan has been in the news since 2014-2015. Initially, it was reported that Apple was working on an ""iCar."" There were numerous reports of the company making sound talent acquisitions as well as collaborating with the likes of BMW for the car design. VP of Product Design, Steve Zadesky was permitted to set up a 1K strong workforce for the project.Later on, the ""iCar"" rumors lost steam as the project was reportedly marred by conflicts and management troubles. Following this, Apple decided to prune some of its 1K strong workforce assigned to the project. In Jan 2016, with the resignation of Zadesky, things became more blurred. However, reportedly, Bob Mansfield was brought on board to once again spearhead the project in July 2016.It is now speculated that Apple may not be designing a full fledged car but an autonomous self driving car technology platform.Apple's fortunes remain tied to its flagship offering, iPhone, at least in the near term. With iPhone 7 and 7 Plus performing relatively well and the excitement building up for iPhone 8 (dubbed as a super cycle), Apple can breathe easy.However, increasing competition from cheaper handsets is emerging as a big concern. Apple is under great pressure to introduce new products. Apple Pay, Apple Watch, Apple Music are some of the new ventures undertaken by the company.Also, revenues from App Store are growing. Apple is also working on developing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality/ virtual reality (AR/VR), which are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. The company's interest in the autonomous car project is understandable as this is now being labeled as a big business opportunity.According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025.Self-driving technology gained immense importance in the past few years with tech and auto behemoths like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), Ford (NYSE:F-Free Report), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report), Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Uber and Lyft directing resources to develop this technology.However, analysts are skeptical about self-driving cars being feasible before 2020, at least.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX);4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYesterday's relief rally is set to spill over into today's trading, as U.S. stock futures are pointed broadly higher heading into the open. Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief yesterday after centrist Emmanuel Macron's win in the first round of the French presidential election, easing fears of an EU breakup. Meanwhile, traders are turning their eyes to corporate earnings, withMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD) andCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) in focus this morning.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.76%, withS&P 500futures higher by 0.3% andNasdaq-100futures rising 0.31%.On the options front, volume remained brisk on Monday, with about 16.6 million calls and 15.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropped to 0.61 amid the French relief rally, though the 10-day moving average remained at its three-month high perch of 0.70.Driving Monday's most active options,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) paced the rest of the finance industry's gains and drew heavy call volume as fears of an early EU demise waned. Elsewhere, bothMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) drew heavier-than-normal call activity ahead of their respective Thursday quarterly earnings reports.Bank of America Corp (BAC)It may not have seemed like much to the average investor, but Emmanuel Macron's win in the first round of the French presidential elections was a rather big deal -especially for the banking sector. So much so that BAC stock rallied more than 4% following the results, more than the shares jumped in the wake of Bank of America's impressive first-quarter earnings report earlier this month.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnBy the close of trading, BAC had added more than 4% and topped former resistance at $23.50.BofA options traders were also keen to take note of the situation. On Monday, more than 1.3 million contracts changed hands on BAC stock, with calls snapping up 70% of the day's take. Taking a closer look at the activity, however, reveals that not all of yesterday's call activity was of the buy-to-open variety.In fact,Trade-Alert.comreports that a block of 27,400 July $26 calls were sold for the bid price of 29 cents, or $29 per contract. The $26 area is home to BAC's multiyear highs back in March, and could provide resistance once again going forward.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)The flood of corporate earnings reports ramps up considerably this week, with software behemoth Microsoft releasing its quarterly report this Thursday. Wall Street is expecting a profit of 69 cents per share on revenue of $23.44 billion, thoughEarningsWhispers.complaces the whisper number three cents higher at 72 cents per share. MSFT stock has been in rally mode since July 2016, gaining more than 25% during this period, and another solid report this week could extend that rally.Options traders appear to be betting on more upside for Microsoft, with calls making up 63% of the more than 453,000 contracts traded on Monday. Among the more notable trades on MSFT yesterday was a block of over 11,800 October $67.50 calls that traded at the ask price of $3.55, or $355 per contract, according to Trade-Alert.com.As of yesterday's close, these calls are in the money, though this particular trader needs MSFT to rally above $71.05 before October options expire in order to break even on this position.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)Coffee baron Starbucks is also slated to enter the earnings confessional this Thursday, with the consensus expecting a profit of 45 cents per share on revenue of $5.42 billion. The whisper number rests at 46 cents per share. Ahead of the report,UBS released a reporttitled ""Outlook is All Rainbows and Unicorns"" for Starbucks, reaffirming its ""outperform"" rating, $70 price target and noting that limited-time offers, such as the Unicorn Frappuccino, would help bolster Starbucks' bottom line.T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) Stock Still Buy-Worthy After Big Q1 BeatOptions traders took this bullish sentiment to heart, as calls accounted for a whopping 84% of yesterday's more than 254,000 contracts.What's more, Trade-Alert.com reports that several large blocks totaling 12,000-18,000 contracts traded on the April 28 $61.50, $62.50, $63.50 and $65 strikes - all at their respective ask prices, apparently, and all marked ""spread."" Without knowing the details, this appears to be a vertical call spread of some sort, designed to profit from a post-earnings rally in SBUX stock, with all contracts expiring this Friday.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Healthcare Stocks With A-Rated Prospects8 Retail Stocks That Can Win Despite AmazonTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has Nothing to Worry AboutThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is More Than iPhone 8;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfterInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) reported a drop in profits in its quarterly results, Apple stock investors may think twice aboutApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockStrong sales of iPhones are hardly assured. Even though valuations between the two companies are similar on a forward price-earnings basis (12 for IBM and 13.8 for Apple), Apple will probably please the market when it reports results next month.Investors should also ignore rumors about the iPhone 8. Sales for the existing models are only starting to ramp up now.iPhone 8 Versus Samsung Galaxy S8Apple's impending release of an iPhone 8 would mark the tenth-anniversary for the device. Yet the company just released the iPhone 7 in September 2016. Refreshing the model just after a year may not make much sense. Apple stock isn't under significant pressure by competition fromSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) or any other Android device maker.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnStill, consumers may overlook the expensive initial price ofnearly $800 for the Galaxy S8. Samsung is releasing the latest phone on April 21. Fans may like the Galaxy S8's biometric scanners, which include iris and fingerprint scanning. Those are some of the ways the phone may get unlocked.Samsung will introduce an assistant named Bixby, but this feature could underwhelm its users. Chances are high that the AI software will be buggy and will need fixing. That is typical for any technology product that is in its first generation.By comparison, Apple introduced Siri on the iPhone 4S, way back in October 2011. Bixby is competing against six years of iterations on Siri.Expectations for Second QuarterAnalysts expect Apple will report revenue inthe range of $51.7 billion to $54.6 billion. That translates to earnings of between $1.91 to $2.14 per share. If Apple meets those expectations, that would imply revenue growing in the single digits, at around 5%. The company will likely report that its cash balance grew again. Apple stock ended its last quarter with $230 billion in offshore cash.The massive cash balance will only fuel rumors of the company making a big acquisition. Apple stock is strategically better positioned if it waits for the government to allow for repatriating the cash at a lower tax rate. The company may invest the proceeds in the business or make smaller, local acquisitions. Historically, Apple does not buy companies in the $100 billion range. Its biggest acquisition to date was Beats Electronics for $3 billion in August 2014.Diversifying Business Through Autonomous DrivingApple's management may give more details on its ambitions in building self-driving car technology. On April 14, the company received a permit thatallows it to test auto-driving carsin California.Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) need not worry about Apple as a competitor. Apple is working only on the software part of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems).Tesla develops both the all-electric hardware and the software. Still, staying away from the hardware aspect of automotive development should keep profit margins high for Apple. Car manufacturing is inherently a low-profit business. Similar toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) selling Windows software and not low-commodity PCs, Apple will sell the software that self-driving cars will use.Apple is very deliberate on the products it produces. The company is in no rush to release the next iPhone 8, but it is keen on diversifying its business outside of smartphones. Apple's progress in developing autonomous driving software ultimately makes the company a solid investment for long-time shareholders.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Home Improvement Stocks to Buy for Unstoppable Gains3 South Korean Stocks That Are Feeling the Heat3 Downtrodden Stocks That You Need to Short NowThe postApple Inc.

Tesla is Doubling Its Supercharger Network in 2017;4/24/2017;"On Monday, electric car makerTesla Inc.TSLAannouncedin a blog postthat is plans to double its global Supercharger network this year, expanding both the size and number of stations, in addition to constructing charging stations along busy highways.Tesla wants to make ""charging [their] priority."" In anticipation of the busy summer travel season, many spots will begin construction soon, and the company hopes to bring the network to a total of 10,000 Supercharger locations and 15,000 Destination Charging connectors. Tesla wants to add over 1,000 Superchargers in California alone, and increase the number of chargers in the U.S. by 150%.The Supercharger network began back in 2012 with the goal of enabling long-distance travel in a Tesla vehicle. Superchargers have charging power of 145kW, and can provide approximately 170 miles of range in about 30 minutes. Destination Charging connectors, however, are a bit different; these replicate the ""convenience of home charging"" by partnering with hotels, restaurants, and other destinations, and setting them up with Tesla Wall Connectors.Tesla recently announced that all new Tesla buyers, including Model 3 owners, will now need to pay for the electricity acquired at Supercharger stations after exhausting a yearly allotment.

Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Investors Are Begging For ANY Good News;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a tough couple of months forRite Aid Corporation(NYSE:RAD) stock. Rite Aid stock traded near $9 as recently as mid-January. Investors then were betting that a Donald Trump Administration Federal Trade Commission would approve the company's acquisition byWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NASDAQ:WBA). With WBA offering an even $9 per share for RAD stock, RAD's $8.75 highs implied overwhelmingly positive odds of an approval.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrA little over three months later, the situation looks very different. Walgreens cut its offer to $6.50-$7 per share of Rite Aid stock from the original $9. Since then, RAD stock has declined 57%, and trades below $4.Clearly, investors are far less confident in the merger's approval. That, in turn, has increased the focus on Rite Aid earnings and sales - a problem itself after a tough few quarters for the company.Same-store sales declined 1.8% through the first three quarters of RAD's fiscal 2017 (ending February), including a 3.4% drop in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% during the same period. Given Rite Aid's $7.3 billion in debt, fiscal year 2017 weakness raises serious concerns about the company's prospects if the merger fails.The result has been a triple whammy for RAD stock - the buyout price has been cut, the odds of that buyout are down and the value of Rite Aid stock on its own has weakened due to poor operating performance. Indeed, Deutsche Bank valued a standalone RAD stockat just $2.25last month.8 Retail Stocks That Can Win Despite AmazonThat leaves shareholders desperate for some kind of good news -anygood news - in the Rite Aid earnings report on Tuesday. But investors should be skeptical that such good news will arrive quite yet.The Walgreens-Rite Aid MergerObviously, the focus coming out of Rite Aid earnings will be on the conference call. Investors will be trying to ""read the tea leaves"" in management commentary relative to expectations as to whether the WBA takeover will be approved. After all, even the low end of Walgreens' updated range suggests 70%-plus upside for RAD stock - should the merger go through.The problem in the short term is that the Rite Aid earnings call seems unlikely to offer much clarity. It's not as if Rite Aid management has inside information on the FTC's thought process. Meanwhile, the five-person FTC board hasthree vacancies already, which not only complicates approval but makes forecasting the odds of approval rather difficult. The FTC also has other pressing matters to contend with - including a possible antitrust suit againstQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM).Investors expecting game-changing news out of Rite Aid earnings seem likely to be disappointed.Bear in mind that Walgreens management repeatedly said on its Q2 call earlier this month that it expected the merger to go through. Rite Aid stock stabilized for a few sessions, but then resumed its decline. No matter what Rite Aid executives say at this point, it's unlikely the market will believe them.RAD Stock EarningsIf there isn't major news relative to the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, as seems likely, then the catalyst will have to come from Rite Aid earnings and sales. That seems unlikely as well.Rite Aid's business simply isn't performing all that well. As noted, same-store sales are down almost 2% year-to-date. In contrast, Walgreens grew comparable store sales 1.8% in the first six months of its fiscal 2017.CVS Health Corp(NYSE:CVS) comps rose 1.9% in 2016. Meanwhile,Fred's, Inc.(NASDAQ:FRED) - who will purchase hundreds of Rite Aid stores if the WBA-RAD merger goes through - saw a 2%-plusdeclinein its fiscal 2016 (ending January of this year).It looks as if Walgreens and CVS are outperforming their smaller competitors. And with Rite Aid having a huge debt load - $7 billion, against a likely ~$1 billion in Adjusted EBITDA this year - that's a huge problem if the merger doesn't go through.Bear in mind that Rite Aid stock was pretty much left for dead not all that long ago, trading around $1 through the end of 2012. If the company can't get sales and earnings positive, RAD stock could return to those levels.Buy Rite Aid Stock?To be honest, I do think RAD stock looks somewhat tempting at current levels. Obviously, RAD is a high-risk play. But assuming Rite Aid stock is worth something in the event the merger falls through, the current price implies a less than 50% chance of FTC approval.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has Nothing to Worry AboutThat does seem a bit too low. The divestitures to Fred's would create a legitimate third competitor to Walgreens and CVS. As an analyst pointed out relative to the potential merger betweenSprint Corp(NYSE:S) andT-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS), the rule of thumb is thatRepublicans want three competitorsin an industry, and Democrats four. That in turn implies that the merger should go through under the Trump Administration … at some point.The near-term problem is that I don't believe the Rite Aid earnings report will do much for Rite Aid stock - except maybe push it down. Unless there's a surprise waiting, I don't think the good news RAD stock needs so desperately is on the way. For aggressive traders, that might create a more attractive entry point. For investors who already own Rite Aid stock, however, the Q4 earnings report could be just one more disappointment.As of this writing, Vince Martin had no positions in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade7 Healthcare Stocks With A-Rated ProspectsCostco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Stock Has Free Profits on the ShelvesThe postRite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Investors Are Begging For ANY Good Newsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The problem couldprevent the parking brake from releasing.The company does not believe this will lead to any safety concerns for customers. Markets are not reacting to the news because the recall affects only a small percentage of cars on the market. Since a gear built by a third-party is responsible, Tesla will incur no significant costs.Price CutsTesla's decision to cut prices on the Model S by almost $8,000, along with including the all-glass roof as standard, may incentivize potential customers to buy Tesla. The price reduction will also narrow the gap between that and the upcoming Model 3, which costs nearly half the price.8 Retail Stocks That Can Win Despite AmazonThe company is also making room for a higher-priced model. The company may have decided to lower prices, to make room for the P100D. Still, investors should look for confirmation that the price differentiation between the Model S and P100D is big enough that overall sales go up.Tesla Model 3: Three Months AwayAt a $35,000 base price, the Tesla Model 3 will target the mainstream market. Its release three months from now will also put the company in more direct competition withBMW(OTCMKTS:BMWYY) andMercedes-Benz.Though the pricing for the Model 3 is comparable to that of BMW's 3 series and the C-Class from Mercedes-Benz, similarities end from there.Tesla's car is all-electric, while the premium brands still rely on gas for the energy source. Strong initial sales for Tesla's less expensive EV will give the company a vote of confidence.In the all-electric market segment, Tesla held 30% of the marketin 2016. It will very likely grow share with the Tesla 3's release.Tesla Enters Truck MarketOn a bullish note, CEO Elon Musk'stweetedthat hints Tesla will manufacture trucks. Building trucks with bigger batteries to support longer driving ranges will be the company's biggest engineering feat. Should the truck have limited range, drivers will only handle only local deliveries.Tesla may have further improved battery technology, increase aerodynamic efficiencies and minimized its R&D costs in designing the truck. As an early mover for EVs in this market, the company has a good chance of winning market share. This will translate to higher revenue growth and a justification in the high valuations of TSLA stock.Tesla's quarterly results will shed some light on how much the company expects it will spend on capex and R&D. Entering the truck market will hurt cash flow this year. But Tesla needs to widen its addressable market beyond cars by making trucks.TSLA stock is in the early phase of two major product releases: the Model 3 car and a new truck. The company will strengthen its leadership in the EV market by growing its market share.More From InvestorPlace5 Fortune 500 CEOs Who Are Lucky to Have Jobs10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsThe postTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has Nothing to Worry Aboutappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Ahead of Model 3, Tesla Inc. to Double Its Supercharger Network;4/24/2017;"Transitioning from producing vehicles at a rate of about   100,000 units annually today toTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) target to build 500,000 vehicles in 2018 alone   is prone to come with some hitches, and an insufficient charging   network could be one of them. But Tesla seems resolved to make   sure this won't be a problem.The electric-car maker announced Monday morning that it is   expanding its current charging network from about 5,400   Superchargers today to more than 10,000 Superchargers by the end   of 2017 -- up from about 5,000 Superchargers at the beginning of   the year. The expansion adds to a number of recent strategic   moves Tesla has made to revamp its Supercharger program ahead of   its higher-volume, lower-costModel 3 launchin July.Tesla plans to add customer centers at some of its new big     Supercharger sites. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Getting to 10,000 Superchargers""As Tesla prepares for our first mass-market vehicle and   continues to increase our Model S and Model X fleet, we're making   charging an even greater priority,"" Tesla said on Monday. ""It is   extremely important to us and our mission that charging is   convenient, abundant, and reliable for all owners, current and   future.""Increasing its total Superchargers from 5,400 to 10,000   globally will mark an unprecedented expansion rate for Tesla's   charging network. After first launching its Supercharger network   in 2012, it took Tesla nearly five years to build out its   Supercharger network to 5,400 fast-charging connections. Its   latest expansion plans call for 4,600 more connections in just   over six months.Notably, Tesla says it will increase its Superchargers in   North America by 150% and add more than 1,000 Superchargers in   California alone. The expansion plans also include new chargers   in Asia Pacific and Europe. ""We're moving full speed on site   selection and many sites will soon enter construction to open in   advance of the summer travel season,"" Tesla said.Furthermore, Tesla also said the company will build some new   larger sites along its busiest travel sites that will accommodate   charging for several dozen vehicles and include customer   centers.Preparing for Model 3Based on the approximately 400,000 deposit-backed reservations   Tesla has accumulated for its lower-cost Model 3 vehicle while   doingvery little to market the new car, Tesla expects the vehicle's July launch to put much higher   demands on its charging network next year. This expansion will   help Tesla prepare an expected surge in its vehicle fleet   size.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.But Tesla is preparing for this higher demand on its network   in other ways, too. Namely, starting in 2017, Tesla announced new   vehicles would only includeabout 1,000 milesof free charging for long-distance travel per year. Also, Tesla   recently implemented anidling feefor vehicles that are plugged into Supercharger locations but are   no longer charging.Tesla's Supercharger network is an integral piece to the value   proposition for Tesla customers. The company's aggressive   expansion has essentially enabled long-distance travel anywhere   in the United States and has facilitated convenient travel in   other overseas markets like Western Europe and China. The   charging stations provide about 170 miles in 30 minutes.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rumors have been flying for several years thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is secretly working on autonomous driving technology. We even had the code name for the effort: Project Titan. However, the cat was officially out of the bag two weeks ago when AAPL received a permit to test an autonomous car in California.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleNow, thanks to official training documents obtained byBusiness Insider, we know what Apple's self-driving car technology looks like.Why Apple Is Interested in Autonomous Car TechnologyThe closest Apple has ever come to releasing a product for automobiles is its CarPlay standard for integrating an iPhone into a car's entertainment system. So why the apparent fascination with futuristic auto technology like an autonomous car?The company has exploded in value and influence over the past decade because of the iPhone, but it's looking for the next big hit. With the successTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has had, and the publicityAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has reaped from it's self-driving car program, Apple clearly saw an opportunity. Over88 million cars and light duty trucks were sold in 2016and the revenue for automotive suppliers alone surpassed $670 billion in 2015.Even carving out a small slice of this market would be huge for AAPL stock holders.Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Going to Burn Amid Flex 2 Explosion ReportWe started to hear about Apple's Project Titan in 2015. At first, it was thought to be an electric car to compete with Tesla. Even Tesla'sElon Musk seemed convincedApple was preparing to directly take on his company. However, last fall there was an apparentshake-up in Project Titan. It was believed that Apple was pivoting from developing its own electric Apple car to instead developing an autonomous car software platform it could sell to automakers.Two weeks ago, Apple officially tipped its hand. The company received a permit to drive three Lexus vehicles equipped with autonomous car technology on California roads.Apple's Self-Driving Car Technology Outed by Training ManualBusiness Insidergot the scoop on what AAPL is up toby obtaining a copy of a training manual and official government documentation filed by the company.Called the Apple Automated System, AAPL's self-driving car platform uses a combination of hardware and software. Apple says its system is ""capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task.""The documentation describes the testing Apple drivers must undergo on a private course before being allowed to take the Lexus autonomous car onto public roads. It also includes photographs of the cockpit of the cars and even details the modifications made to the vehicles.AAPL has equipped its test cars with a steering wheel and pedals made byLogitech(NASDAQ:LOGI) -the manufacturer of video game peripherals. The human ""driver"" can instantly take over control of the self-driving car by touching the brakes or grabbing the steering wheel.Where Does the Apple Automated System Go From Here?The end game for the Apple Automated System is clearly not to power an Apple car. At least not yet. Instead, AAPL will take aim at the traditional auto makers, hoping to convince them to license its system in their vehicles instead of spending the time and money to develop their own in-house technology.7 Tech Stocks That Are a Sneeze Away From CollapsingEven though it's now public knowledge, expect AAPL to remain tight-lipped on its autonomous car project. The Apple Lexus test vehicles will be spotted on California roads, but with so much at stake -Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) recently dropped $15 billion onMobileyetodevelop its own autonomous vehicle platform- Apple is likely to keep its cards close until it's ready for the big reveal.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBeware of Apple Inc.

Are These Highflyers About to Crash?;4/24/2017;"One of the most gratifying feelings as an investor is to see   your buy thesis for any given stock come to fruition. But given   the happy consequence of share-price appreciation that tends to   come with this type of situation, you might be left wondering   whether it would be wise to take profits off the table.So we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in on   what investors should think about three popular high-flying   stocks. Read on to learn what they had to say aboutAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) ,Veeva Systems(NYSE: VEEV) , andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();Any missteps could badly hurt this graphics chip   specialistSteve Symington(Advanced Micro Devices):Shares of AMD have soared nearly 400% over the past year as of   this writing, and with good reason. Afterlosing significant graphics card market shareto competitorNVIDIAfrom late 2014 through the middle of 2015, AMD graduallyregained its footingto end 2016 with market share of roughly 29.5% (up from   21.6% at the start of the year). Most recently, AMD investors are   rightly excited over the prospects for the impending launch of   high-end cards based on the chipmaker's Vega GPU   architecture.But given its meteoric rise, I'm not the only one worried that   AMD's stock price may have gotten ahead of the actual business.   Earlier this month,shares declinedafter Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on AMD with a sell rating   and $11-per-share price target (the current price is around $13),   arguing that AMD's remaining market-share gains are limited, and   that both NVIDIA andIntelhave the flexibility to reduce their own chip prices in an effort   to stem AMD's progress, if necessary. The GPU market also   tends to ebb and flow given the combination of upgrade cycles and   continuous innovation in the space. So investors shouldn't   underestimate the ability of AMD's competitors to claw back what   they've lost over the past year with their own new   technology.But more concerning is the fact that AMD still isn't   profitable, delivering aGAAPnet loss of $497 million last year and an adjusted (non-GAAP) net   loss of $117 million -- albeit narrowed from 2015 GAAP and   adjusted losses of $660 million and $419 million,   respectively. So if AMD suffers any hiccups this year as it   strives to maintain its momentum and return to sustained,   profitable growth, I fear its stock price will give back the   recent gains in a hurry.Veeva has been on a tear, but how long will it last?Brian Stoffel(Veeva Systems):Veeva Systems has found a very profitable niche. The company,   which is the brainchild of its founder-CEO and formersalesforce.comexecutive, Peter Gassner, offers cloud solutions to drug   companies. These solutions can do everything from tracking sales   of certain drugs to storing and sharing mission-critical   information during the drug approval process.Shareholders have been rewarded handsomely for their faith in   Gassner and company, with the stock up 140% since February of   last year. But that has put the company in nosebleed-valuation   territory. Currently, shares trade hands for 69 times non-GAAP   earnings and 51 times free cash flow.When stocks have this type of valuation, the slightest worry   can send shares down. And in fact, there are a number of things   that investors need to be aware of. For starters, Veeva has   developed a cloud solution for clients outside of the   pharmaceutical industry. I believe part of the run-up in price is   associated with high sales expectations for Veeva in this new   venture. But this new path is untested, and it remains to be seen   how well it will be received in other industries.Furthermore, Veeva has made it clear that it will be investing   aggressively in its future. That means that while sales may   continue to grow, profitability may not. In fact, after adjusting   their calculations, analysts expect Veeva to show non-GAAP EPS   growth of only 8% this year. That's not typically what you'd   expect from such an expensive stock.But, as along-termshareholder, I am unconcerned. I am well-aware that Veeva's stock   may fall in the short term. That is the nature of its industry.   Over the long run, however, I have faith in the company's moat   and its undeniable business momentum.Don't hit the brakes on this stockDan Caplinger(Tesla):Tesla has gotten headlines lately because investors have assigned   a valuation on the company that exceeds those of the much more   mature Big Three automakers. Just since the beginning of 2017,   Tesla is up 40%, yet the company is nowhere near being   profitable. The stock price implies a multiple to trailing sales   of 7, and skeptics believe that there's little chance that Tesla   can ramp up quickly enough to justify its current valuation even   as the mass-market Model 3 approaches its anticipated release   date later this year and starts to deliver on the roughly 400,000   preorders that the new car company has gotten for the lower-end   Tesla car.Tesla has a number of growth prospects in its pipeline that it   hopes will allow it to maximize its potential. On the solar   front, Tesla has released new solar panels that it claims have   more attractive designs to entice homeowners into using them on   their homes. Meanwhile, the automaker also foresees entering the   commercial transportation arena, with a heavy-duty truck and   transit alternatives that could take advantage of Tesla   technology for non-consumer purposes. None of this is to say that   Tesla isn't richly valued and potentially vulnerable to a   decline, but people have been predicting that Tesla would see an   outright crash for a long time without having succeeded. Betting   against Tesla right now is likely a mistake.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Driverless Car Stocks You Won't Have to Babysit;4/24/2017;"Driverless cars are still in their infancy, but many   technology companies and automakers have shifted their efforts to   develop semi-autonomous systems into high gear as they wait   for the tech and the market to fully materialize. And well they   should -- by 2035, some analysts foresee the market for partially   and fully autonomous vehicles hitting $77 billion a year.We're still years away from fully autonomous vehicles, but a   handful of companies are making bigger strides toward them than   their rivals. Among those areAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google,NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) . Each is taking a different approach the   driverless car market, but all are solid plays that investors   don't need to babysit.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AlphabetAlphabet's well-known efforts to develop driverless car   technologies began back in 2009, first as a project run by its   Google X R&D unit, and later spun off into their own   subsidiary, called Waymo.Through Waymo, Alphabet is working withFiat Chryslerto release 100 self-driving minivans later this year. Waymo CEO   John Krafcik said in press release last year that the   company wants to bring driverless car services to ride-sharing,   as well trucking, logistics, and consumer vehicles -- which   represents, essentially, nearly every facet of the automotive   market.Considering its just a small subsidiary, investors shouldn't   expect revenues from Waymo to move the needle at all for Alphabet   right now. But the parent company is very adept at figuring how   to monetize its businesses, and the fact that it was spun out   shows that management is confident that the unit could bring in   revenues of its own.With more than eight years of autonomous vehicle experience   under its belt already, and the $86 billion in cash Alphabet has   on hand to exploit whatever opportunities it finds, this   driverless car play is the epitome of a set-it-and-forget-it   stock.TeslaTesla has made some bold claims about its driverless-car plans   in the past. CEO Elon Musk said last year that by 2018, the   company's cars would be able to be summoned remotely by their   owners -- as in not driven by anyone -- from across the   country.It's looking highly unlikely that Tesla will havethatfeature live by next year, but the electric automaker's vehicles   are still far ahead of its competition. New Teslas already come   equipped with fully autonomous driving hardware, and ongoing   updates to the vehicles' software are slowly making more and more   self-driving features available to their owners.Investors should note that Tesla's valuation issky high right now, with a price-to-sales ratio of 7.1, compared to 0.29 for   competitors likeFord, and a forward P/E that sits above 150.There's likely to be some volatility ahead forTesla stockfor that reason, but that doesn't mean thatcurrentTesla shareholders will have to babysit their investment.   Tesla is ahead of other automakers in the semi-autonomous space,   and will likely continue to keep its lead for the foreseeable   future. But investors considering opening up a position in the   company should know that Tesla will likely have a hard time   growing at the rate it needs to justify its current   valuations.NVIDIAAnother solid bet on the driverless car market is graphics   processing unit (GPU) maker NVIDIA. The company has developed an   automotive AI computing platform called Drive PX 2, that can   rapidly process data from cameras and give semi-autonomous   vehicles situational awareness -- allowing them to ""understand""   and properly react to what they see around them.Already about 80 automakers and Tier 1 suppliers are using or   testing Drive PX, and Tesla is the latest company to partner with   NVIDIA for semi-autonomous driving systems. NVIDIA earned about   7% of its total revenue in its fiscal 2017 (which ended Jan. 29)   from its automotive segment, and sales from the business grew by   37% year over year in fiscal Q4 2017.Aside from that growth and its early lead in selling   semi-autonomous vehicle supercomputers to automakers, NVIDIA is   the leader in the GPU space, and earns most of its money (59% in   fiscal 2017) from sales in the gaming market. This will continue   to provide NVIDIA a lot of stability -- and resources -- as it   builds out its driverless car technologies. And it's a key reason   why investors won't have to keep a close eye on the company.To be clear, any investment comes with its own level of risk,   and investors shouldn't assume that Alphabet, Tesla, or NVIDIA   are now, or will remain, sure bets. But each company is poised to   dominate the driverless car market in their own way, which means   investors can rest a little easier with these companies in their   portfolios.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How to Trade Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Before Earnings;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBelieve it or not, it's not time to back up the truck inFord Motor Company(NYSE:F). But with enough support both off and on the Ford stock price chart and with earnings on the horizon, it's time to take a bullish test drive in Ford options. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockHave you driven a Ford lately? If you have, I'm sure it's been better than ride F stock holders have been on. A steady, above-market yield of 5.2% has been no match for a 52-week loss of nearly 16% or decline of 38% from Ford's two-year highs.Not to pour salt on wounds, but F stock's dismal price action has occurred alongside a bull market in the broader averages that's been acting, more or less, like a turbo-powered mustang. But could Ford be on the verge of finally turning the corner?As I personally wrote back in early March,the road ahead does look strongfor Ford stock. For one, Ford is the first auto company that's set a firm target date of 2021 for rolling out fully autonomous vehicles into the market.Secondly, Ford's focus on becoming a more nimble auto company with an eye on increased manufacturing efficiency means when theinevitable cyclical sales declineoccurs, Ford will be ready.3 Covered Calls in Times of War and PeaceThe point is, it's not the end of the road for Ford stock or that matter. That's not to say Ford'svalue-alluring multiplesand juicy dividend couldn't come under pressure. Likewise, don't hold your breath that Ford will ever have the appeal ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) with traders.But there does come a time when a stock looks good for a test drive - and Ford exudes that right now.Ford Stock Weekly ChartClick to EnlargeLooking at the weekly chart, I'm reminded of some moderate optimism on my part, anticipating shares were bottoming back in early March.Prior, a tight consolidation near $12.50 following a ""government work"" i.e. close enough, February - November 2016 double bottom around $11 in Ford looked like a sufficiently strong platform in our technical opinion for shares to finally rally.I was clearly wrong on the price action, although the strategy selection in Ford's options was a good deal stronger.In the here and now, Ford shares have gone from a double to a triple bottom with price action wedged between the 38% and 50% retracement levels dating back to the 2009 financial crisis bottom.With a bullish stochastics crossover in oversold territory and candlestick confirmation of the 'triple / double' bottom-I do, along with another optimistic caveat, believe F stock is worth a test drive long.Ford Stock Long Call StrategyPreviously, with shares at $12.49, a June $14 call/($11/$10 put) modified reverse fence strategy is off 21 cents compared to a loss of $1.12 with F now changing hands at $11.37. It's obviously worked quite well given the circumstances.Looking at Ford's options for fresh ideas, I still like this type strategy, in theory at least. Unfortunately, an absence of 50-cent-wide strikes in later-dated maturities, combined with a lack of compelling call premiums to sell, the preferred positioning in Ford stock is a long June $12 call for 17 cents.Ford Premiums are priced mostly middle of the road right now. In my estimation, and similar to our ""government work, good enoughchart, call and put prices are cheaper than not right now.How to Trade Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) Stock Around Q1 EarningsBottom line, buying this Ford call with its protective value and reasonable amount of time on the calendar is a sensible strategy worth a test drive for bullish Ford traders expecting an earnings catalyst later this week.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Should You Buy Into the Hype for These Stocks?;4/24/2017;"It's no secret that Wall Street is forward-looking. The big   question we have to ask ourselves as investors from time to time   is when is the markettooforward-looking. In other words, when do the valuations of stocks   far exceed their hype?With this in mind, we asked three of our Foolish contributors   to weigh in on three highly hyped stocks to decipher whether they   have what it takes to meet that hype. Find out what they had to   say aboutTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Autodesk(NASDAQ: ADSK) , andNorthern Dynasty Minerals(NYSEMKT: NAK) .Tesla could soon turn profitable -- and that could be a     problemRich Smith(Tesla): Has there ever been a more hyped stock than Tesla?makeArticleAd();Elon Musk's electric car start-up (hey, did you hear they make   solar roofs, too?) makes battery buggies that can zoom from 0 to   60 in two seconds. More relevant to investors, Teslastockhas zoomed from$15 million in revenues in 2008, when it first   introduced the Roadster, to $7billionlast year. That's more than 47,000% growth in just eight   years.Tesla Model 3 unveil. Image source: Tesla.And yet, during all this time, Tesla has failed to earn a   full-year profit even once. To the contrary, annual losses have   ballooned from $83 million lost in 2008 to $675 million in 2016   -- an eight-fold increase.That's one reason thatElon Musk's promiseto build and sell 500,000 Tesla electric cars annually by 2018   doesn't excite me as much as it may excite other investors.   Historically, you see, the more cars Tesla sells, the more money   it loses ...Sure,according to some analysts, Tesla might soon turn profitable -- perhaps not in 2018, but by   2019 for sure, says Piper Jaffray. But even then, and even if   Piper is right, I have to wonder: Maybe Teslawillearn a profit in 2019. But what kind of profit will it earn? Will   it earn the 3% operating profit margin thatFord Motorpulls down, for example? Or perhaps even the 6% margin   that's more common atGeneral Motors? Because based on those kinds of profit margins, investors value   Ford stock at only 10 times earnings, and GM at a lowly 6 times   earnings.Right now, with no profits to value Tesla on, investors   happily pay several times annual sales for shares ofTesla stock. Once the company has profits to hang a valuation on, though,   might they not decide to value Tesla stock on those profits?   Because if that happens, then the $0.20 per share Tesla   might earn in 2019 would only be worth about $2 a share at Ford's   valuation, or a buck-twenty at GM's.Those are two far cries from the $308 a share Tesla stock   currently fetches -- and one very big reason why I don't buy the   hype surrounding Tesla stock.Draw me a pictureDemitri Kalogeropoulos(Autodesk):Surging optimism around Autodesk's business has pushed the stock   up nearly 50% in the past year. What's most surprising about that   rally is that it happened while the computer-aided drawing   specialist endured a sharpdeclinein earnings.Net loss ballooned to $582 million in fiscal 2017 compared to   a loss of $330 million the year before. In contrast, the company   had been generating consistent annual profits of over $200   million as recently as 2014.ADSKdata byYChartsYet investors are salivating at the financial prospects that   Autodesk's shift to a subscription-based selling model might soon   deliver. After selling perpetual licenses for years, the company   has transitioned to term based memberships through the cloud.The shift is making Autodesk appear less profitable, since it   now books revenue and earnings over time rather than in a lump   sum. That makes subscription figures the key metric for investors   to watch right now -- and the good news is that they have shown   robust growth. Subscriptions jumped 21% last year to over 3   million, which represents a strong base of recurring revenue.Management believes it can boost subscriptions at a 20% pace   in fiscal 2018, Autodesk's first full year under the new business   model. If it can keep that momentum going, while also upgrading   many of the company's maintenance customers into bigger,   product-based subscriptions, Autodesk should make solid progress   toward returning to profitability this year and earning its   premium valuation.A mountain of promise that can't be metSean Williams(Northern Dynasty Minerals): Northern Dynasty Minerals has, for lack of a better pun, been   a hot commodity among short-term traders in recent months.The company, which is an exploratory-stage precious-metals   miner, has the rights to the Pebble Project in Alaska. This   project could, in theory, be mined out for well over 100 years.   The election of Donald Trump, who is expected to relax a number   of environmental protections (and thus ease the permitting of   Pebble in Alaska), as well as rising physicalgold priceson a per-ounce basis, have investors excited about the company's   prospects.As for me, I'm not buying into this hype.Image source: Getty Images.The biggest issue I have with a company claiming to be sitting   on a literal gold mine is that its own management team isn't   certain if the assets can be recovered profitably. The following   excerpt is taken directly from Northern Dynasty Minerals'   fourth-quarter report:The Group is in the process of exploring and developing the     Pebble Project and has not yet determined whether the Pebble     Project contains mineral reserves that are economically     recoverable.In other words, there are no guarantees that, even if the   minerals that are in the ground are proved resources, the company   has a way to recover those minerals for a profit.Even if the company did, it's going to need a heck of a lot   more capital than it has now. It ended the fourth quarter with   $7.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, but burned through $24   million in 2016. It did complete a secondary share offering in   January for $32 million, but with the way it burns through its   cash on hand, this only buys it about a year.Plus, developing the Pebble Project would cost billions upon   billions of dollars, and we'd likely be two years, if not more,   out from commercial production commencing. What bank in its right   mind is going to lend that much to Northern Dynasty without any   assurances that recovery can be done profitably for an extended   period of time?Pebble has changed hands a few times prior to Northern Dynasty   scooping it up, and there may be a good reason its prior owners   ditched the asset. Put plainly, investors putting their hopes   into Northern Dynasty could be sorely disappointed.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Could Tesla Really Become a $500 Billion Company?;4/22/2017;"Never one to shy away from bold predictions,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has yet another one, and it's not   about his new Neuralink venture that was detailed on Wait But Why   last night.The electric-car maker has been facing some workforce   challenges at its Tesla Grohmann unit, the German automation   company that it acquired in November. Local workers are feeling   uneasy about job security after Tesla killed all contracts with   other automotive customers, and they are threatening to strike   and want to unionize with IG Metall (the dominant German   metalworkers' union).In an effort to appease the local workforce, Musk has offered   a modest salary increase alongside generous equity compensation,   a similar approach that the company is taking at its Fremont   factory, where there is growing unrest among workers that also   want to organize with the UAW. In an email to the local workforce   obtained byElectrek, Musk underscores the potential for capital appreciation   (translated from German):makeArticleAd();These shares can be easily sold for money, but they also     open up the possibility of earning much more through stock     appreciation. The tenfold increase in our share price over the     past five years has made shareholding exceptionally profitable     for our Tesla employees. I firmly believe that we have the     potential for a further tenfold increase over the next five to     10 years.Tesla's market cap is currently hovering right around $50   billion, so a ""tenfold increase over the next 5 to ten years""   would translate into a market cap of $500 billion.The whole value chain. Image source: Tesla.That's actually conservative relative to his prior   predictionMusk made headlines last summer when Tesla initially proposed   its acquisition of sister company SolarCity. On the conference   call to discuss the deal, thiscommentattracted plenty of jeers (emphasis added):I think as a combined automotive and power storage and power     generation company, the potential is there for Tesla to be a$1 trillion company, market cap company. So if we play a major role in transitioning the world to a     new form of energy generation and storage and transport it's     what kind of happens. So that's [why] I think one isn't     going to be worried about whether it's a few hundred million     dollars one way or the other here down the road. It's not going     to make a difference.No company has ever breached that 13-digit threshold, not eventhe most profitable company in the world. Getting to $1 trillion is clearly an outlandish prediction   that's extremely unlikely. But what about $500 billion?Still outlandishTesla is probably the hardest stock in the market to value,   given the lack of comparable peers and the breadth of its goals.   If you compare Tesla to automakers, which fetch extremely low   multiples since they consumecopious amounts of capitaland often post single-digit net margins, getting to $500 billion   seems impossible. If you compare Tesla to large tech companies,   which fetch much higher multiples since most tech companies enjoy   incredible scale and operating leverage, getting to $500 billion   appears at least remotely possible. If you compare Tesla to   energy companies, which are among the largest and most profitable   in the world since they provide an indispensable commodity, $500   billion doesn't seem unreasonable.The challenge is that none of the above comparisons are apt.   Manufacturing cars dominates Tesla's operations and cost   structure, and as such can't scale like other tech companies,   even if it approaches product development, design, iteration, and   integration like a tech company. The aforementioned energy giants   are all oil companies, while solar companies have long struggled   due to the tough economics of the solar industry. There are no   meaningful pure-play battery companies to compare against either,   as most of the companies that dominate the battery space today   are Asian conglomerates like Tesla partnerPanasonic,LG Chem, orSamsung SDI.Musk's futureYou also have to acknowledge that there is a Musk premium   inherently priced in, since he's often considered the greatest   visionary since Steve Jobs. In fact, you could even argue thatMusk is more important to society than Jobsever was, given the seemingly endless scope of Musk's   aspirations -- electric cars, reusable rockets, colonizing Mars,supersonic VTOL electric jets,interfacing human brains with AI, the Hyperloop, weaning the world off fossil fuels with solar   energy,digging holes in parking lots-- that have the very real potential to transform humanity. We're   not just talking about consumer electronics here.Of all of Musk's ventures, Tesla is the only one that's   publicly investable, and people simply want to invest in Musk's   future. All of that interest gets consolidated into Tesla,   contributing to its premium valuation.Don't get me wrong: I would love Tesla to reach $500 billion   in the years ahead, which would make it a1,000-baggerfor me personally. But realistically, while it's theoretically   possible, it's not probable, even if Tesla and Musk have a way of   defying reality, especially when it comes to valuation.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Proves, Once Again, That It Is A Must-Own Stock;4/21/2017;"Tesla (Shutterstock photo)Some stocks, it seems, are just bulletproof. In the normal course of events, stocks react in a fairly predictable way to news. Positive things like better than expected sales or orders cause the stock to rise, while negatives such as problems with a product or the potential loss of key personnel cause it to fall. That is fairly obvious and usually true ... unless that stock is Tesla (TSLA).Yesterday, Tesla announced that they were initiating a recall of 53,000 vehicles due to a parking brake issue. Now there are two ways to look at that number. When compared to the 12.8 million vehicles that GM (GM) recalled in total in 2014 due to faulty ignition switches it is a mere drop in the ocean, and a muted response in the stock seems appropriate.makeArticleAd();Or, from a different point of view, the 53,000 cars recalled represent around 70% of Tesla’s 2016 deliveries. From that perspective, and when consideration is given to the fact that Tesla is still growing and presumably doesn’t have huge reserves of cash for such contingencies, a much larger negative reaction would be perfectly logical.In addition, Tesla CEO Elon Muskannouncedovernight that he has been working on Neuralink, a company that is designing an interface between human brains and computers. The implications of that news are huge. Musk claims that they are about four years away from a commercial product that would allow our brains to control computers and therefore, by extension, almost any machine.Imagine, for example, getting into your Tesla, thinking “I need to pick up some milk” and the car takes you to the nearest milk purveyor, without any pushing of buttons, or even speech.To some that is incredibly scary and to others it is the brave new world, but whatever your reaction, it is a remarkable and revolutionary idea and the potential of Neuralink looks enormous. From the perspective of Tesla stockholders though, the scary part of the news is that Musk stated that he envisaged running the Neuralink project himself and remaining as the company’s CEO.One would expect tech investors, on hearing that, to think immediately of Twitter (TWTR), where CEO and founder Jack Dorsey’s dual role as boss there and at Square (SQ) is often blamed for Twitter’s relatively lackluster performance.With Tesla though, what one would logically expect and what actually happens are often two very different things.The five minute, five day chart above shows that when the recall was announced yesterday TSLA did indeed react; the stock dropped around one and a half percent immediately following the news. From the first perspective, as compared to GM’s 2014 recall that seems about right, but seen as a recall of around 70% of last year’s deliveries the reaction is muted to say the least. The chart also shows pre-market trades this morning, after the Neuralink news broke and, as you can see, there has been no reaction to that in Tesla stock.This ably demonstrates the characteristic of TSLA that infuriates the bears, but in many ways makes it such a great stock: resilience. Investing in a company with as daring a vision as Tesla’s would be in most cases an incredibly risky proposition. The grand plan and rapid growth business model offers the potential for enormous rewards but would normally come with the risk that even minor setbacks could result in huge selloffs.Tesla, however, is different.I will freely admit that at various times in the past I have looked at TSLA and seen it as overvalued, even while recognizing the massive potential. What I did on those occasions was to judge it by conventional metrics and to expect the market to do the same. The reaction to the news over the last 24 hours has shown that that was then, and will continue to be, a mistake. The belief in the company is such and the potential so massive that bad news that would derail most stocks gets shrugged off. It is that resilience that makes TSLA a “must-own."""

Friday Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), General Electric Company (GE) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);4/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointing toward a moderately positive open this morning following a round of better-than-expected corporate earnings and positive economic data. Additionally, sentiment was boosted by comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said in a speech yesterday that details for President Donald Trump's tax reforms would arriving in the near future. However, concern remains ahead of a key French election that could set the stage for aFrench exit from the EU.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave added 0.01%,S&P 500futures are up 0.06% andNasdaq-100futures have gained 0.11%.On the options front, volume was brisk as about 16.9 million calls and 17.1 million puts changed hands on the session. Puts remained highly active, even on the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio came in at 0.68 and the 10-day moving average held at a three-month high of 0.70.Turning to Thursday's most active options,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) calls gained in popularity despite a downgrade at Vetr and recent negativity due to a live-streamed murder in Cleveland. Elsewhere,General Electric Company(NYSE:GE) saw a wave of put activity ahead of this morning's quarterly earnings report andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) also saw heavy put volume amid a Model X and Model S recall.Facebook Inc (FB)With earnings less than a month away,Vetr downgraded FB stockto ""hold"" from ""buy"" yesterday. The downgrade follows on the heels of Facebook's annual F8 Developer Conference and the unfortunate live streaming of a murder in Cleveland via Facebook Live.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeDespite the added controversy, FB stock has moved higher this week, adding a bit of cushion between it and support at $140. Furthermore, sentiment among Facebook stock options traders appears to be on the upswing.Specifically, volume topped out at more than 501,000 contracts for FB yesterday, hitting a near-term high. What's more, calls made up 64% of the day's take, returning Facebook call activity to just shy of average for the past month. As a result of this recent attention to FB calls, the 5 May put/call open interest ratio has edged lower from 0.57 on Wednesday to its current perch at 0.56, as calls are added at a faster rate than puts among options most affected by the company's quarterly report. A continuation of this trend could havebullish implications for Facebook's quarterly earningsreport on May 3.General Electric Company (GE)GE stock is up nearly 2% in premarket trading this morning after General Electric postedbetter-than-expected first quarter resultsthis morning. For the quarter, GE said it earned 21 cents per share, beating the Street's view for 17 cents per share. Revenue also topped expectations at $27.66 billion versus the consensus of $26.4 billion. GE also reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook, further bolstering sentiment.GE options traders were not so keen on the shares ahead of this morning's report, as a last-minute rush of put options held sway on Thursday. Total volume came in north of 380,000 contracts, with puts snapping up 62% of the day's take. That said, those last-minute fears were belied by an established bullish presence in the options pits ahead of the report, with the 21 April put/call OI ratio resting at a near-term low of 0.30. With GE stock on the march higher,short-term GE callshave a solid chance of realizing a profit.Tesla Inc (TSLA)First it was valuation concerns that reigned in TSLA stock's rapid advance into all-time high territory. Now, it's arecall on roughly 53,000 Model S and Model X vehicles. Specifically, Tesla is recalling the vehicles due to a faulty electric parking brake assembly that could prevent the brake from releasing. According to Tesla, only about 2% of the recalled vehicles are affected. Given theeuphoria surrounding TSLA right now, the shares needed sentiment to come down a notch or two, and the shares could also use a bit of a correction to blow off some steam.American Express Company (AXP) Stock Is Charged and Ready to GoTSLA options traders appear to be aware of this fact, as puts took control of yesterday's activity in the options pits. In fact, 53% of yesterday's more than 379,000 contracts traded on TSLA were of the put variety.Furthermore, the recent attention to puts has driven TSLA's May put/call OI ratio to a perch at 0.97. This ratio is far from an annual peak, indicating that there is room for more put activity in the coming weeks.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND Dividends3 High-Yield BDCs With Excellent Dividend CoverageShould You Buy Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsThe postFriday Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), General Electric Company (GE) and Tesla Inc (TSLA)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Ocwen Financial and Tesla;4/21/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 21, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:Ocwen Financial(NYSE:OCN-Free Report) andTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Ocwen Hammered, Tesla Taps BrakesTech stocks are always on my mind but there are a few names that are dominating my screen today. Let's go over what I am seeing and why it is important to investors.Ocwen Gets HammeredOcwen Financial(NYSE:OCN-Free Report) is down around 55% as I write this following a cease and desist order to Ocwen Loan Servicing. This small cap financial services company has seen volume of about 29M shares so far today, but that is well 124M outstanding.The stock has been halted a few times, as investors continue to struggle to find a floor for this stock.The lesson here is that when 20 states give you a cease and desist order, be ready to take a big loss.The halts allowed a few buyers to organize, but selling still look to be the order of the day for this stock.Tesla RecallCNET is reporting that approximately 53KTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) Model S and Model X cars are seeing a voluntary recall. About 31K of those are located in the US and the recall is for cars made between February and October of 2016.TSLA has been in the news quite a bit and I recently wrote about howI expect the stock to go to $450. With earnings a few weeks away the bears might have achieved a toe hold in the idea of TSLA not executing perfectly on its plan.Recall that more than 20% of TSLA stock is sold short and most are pointing to the valuation. Some have mentioned that even if TSLA were to be making money their multiple would only be what other car company's sport (around a 5x-10x multiple). The bulls however don't seem to mind that they are paying more for growth.The real surprise here is that the stock isn't down more! As we look at the chart above the surge in volume shows that there are plenty of buyers around the $300 level. Earning are due out on May 3, at which time a Model 3 update is expected.LessonsSometimes when the sellers hammer a stock they believe it is going to $0.00 and that might be the case with OCN. Other times, there are buyers just waiting for a stock to give back some ground so they can get in. Since I believe that TSLA is headed to $450, I would be a buyer on this weakness.Follow     Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1Want more articles from this author?

Residential Solar Giants May Not Be Low Cost After All;4/21/2017;"National solar installersTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) have long promoted themselves to investors as the   low-price options for going solar. And the company with the   lowest prices would have a significant competitive advantage in   the growing rooftop solar segment.But anew studyfrom the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) shows that   large installers may not offer buyers a cost advantage at all. In   fact, large installers charge significantly higher prices than   smaller competitors for solar power systems, which may explain   why they have been losing market share over the past year.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Higher prices from national installersThe full study byNREL can be seen here, but the big takeaway is that systems from large   installers costs significantly more than those installed by   their smaller competitors. This chart shows the distribution of   quotes NREL studied, mainly from EnergySage and its customers.   Large installers are defined as companies that installed 1,000   solar power systems or more in any year from 2013-2015. I'll note   that these quotes are for system sales, not leases.Source: NREL reportUsing Residential Solar PV Quote Data to Analyze     the Relationship between Installer Pricing and Firm Size.This second chart is probably more meaningful because it   compares direct quotes from large and small competitors. These   are systems on the same house and have been adjusted for factors   like panel quality, efficiency, and other factors. You can see   that a large installer is, on average, $0.33 per share higher   than smaller competitors.Source: NREL reportUsing Residential Solar PV Quote Data to Analyze     the Relationship between Installer Pricing and Firm Size.The price differential could be driven by higher   administrative and sales costs for large installers, or even   higher margins. Small installers often work on referrals,   spending very little on sales and marketing, in contrast to their   larger rivals.What this means for solar companiesNREL wouldn't release the names of the companies in its large   installer group, but we can easily figure that Tesla (formerly   SolarCity), Vivint Solar, and Sunrun are in it. And given their   struggles growing in the past year, this data makes sense. But   there's really no getting around their higher cost structure   without entirely changing their business model.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) has put itself in an interesting position given   this data. It's a large presence in residential solar, but   doesn't have a national installation network of its own. Instead,   it works with lots of smaller, regional companies that install   its solar panels, and use its technology for quoting and other   back-office services.As rooftop solar gets more competitive and customers buy more   systems, it's possible that Tesla, Vivint, and Sunrun will   collectively lose even more market share, and SunPower will grow   its share simply based on the difference between their   installation models. There's just no way around the fact that   large installers are at a cost disadvantage -- and that's not   usually an attractive proposition for investors.10 stocks we like better than Vivint SolarWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

American Express Company (AXP) Stock Is Charged and Ready to Go;4/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) rallied nearly 6% on Thursday, April 20, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. As a result of Thursday's pop, AXP stock looks ready to continue its rally from last October after a pause for the past month-and-a-half.makeArticleAd();Specifically, for its first quarter, American Express reported a profit of $1.2 billion, or $1.34 per share. While this is down from $1.4 billion, or $1.45 per share, in the year-ago period, it was still more than enough to beat analyst expectations of $1.28 per share.Plenty of analysts remain cautious on the stock in part due to the company's end of the relationship with wholesale retailerCostco Wholesale Corporation(NASDAQ:COST), which converted toVisa Inc(NYSE:V). As such, through the lens of price action, Thursday's post-earnings rally might have just caught the stock market by surprise and could force investors back into the stock.AXP Stock ChartsLooking at the multiyear weekly chart, we see that American Express rose sharply from the depths in 2009 to its 2014 highs. From there, AXP endured a painful year-and-a-half or so, as shares lost about 45% by early 2016.Click to EnlargeHowever, at the time, this area around the $50 mark coincided with horizontal support as well as a clean 50% retracement of the entire rally from 2009 to 2014.

Although the stock closed back below the line last week, as a result of yesterday's rally, AXP stock is now right back above it.While the bigger-picture view is interesting and crucial for perspective, the real meat of this trade idea stems from the daily chart.Note that after exhausting its multimonth rally in early March, AXP started to pull back over the past few weeks.Click to EnlargeThis pullback took the shape of what I would describe as a bull flag pattern and measured just about 8%. Note that over the past few days leading up to the earnings report, American Express marginally broke below the 100-day moving average (blue), but this was quickly negated by Thursday's up-gap and rally day. The stock gapped higher by about 2.5%, which fueled on itself and led the stock to close the day up 5.92%.General Electric Company Beats Q1 Earnings, GE Stock Has 20% UpsideI can't overstate the significance of such a post-earnings up-gap. In my eyes, this puts the trajectory of the stock back to the upside.I legged into a quasi-long position in AXP stock on Thursday by selling out-of-the-money put spreads using June options. American Express may be near-term overbought and in need of a little consolidation following Thursday's exhilarating rally. However, barring any major bearish reversal, the low to mid-$80s should serve as a good near- to intermediate-term next upside target.Like what you see?

General Electric Company Beats Q1 Earnings, GE Stock Has 20% Upside;4/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs now the time to bet onGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) and GE stock?makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The industrial conglomerate didn't excite investors Friday with breathtaking earnings results, but the polarizingDow Jones Industrial Averagecomponent continues to improve its Aviation segment - the second-largest unit - which posted a modest jump in first-quarter revenue.GE stock is trading slightly down in Friday's pre-market session. But considering a 3.2% annual dividend yield - better than the S&P 500's 2% payout - and still-promising results, patient investors can still do well in this industrial giant.Powerful First-Quarter EarningsIn the three months that ended March, the Boston-based company not only swung to a first-quarter profit, it also delivered revenue that beat expectations.General Electric posted net earnings of $619 million (7 cents per share) that compared well to last year's loss of 61 cents (-1 cent per share). After backing out one-time gains and costs, GE earned 21 cents per share, topping the average analyst estimate of 17 cents, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearFirst-quarter revenue declined 1% year-over-year to $27.66 billion, dropping from $27.85 billion last year. But that was still enough to beat the Thomson Reuters estimate of $26.37 billion. The revenue decline was mostly due to the woes of the energy business, which has impacted the entire sector.Nevertheless, save for the energy segment, GE benefited from solid results in all operating segments, including oil-and-gas, aviation, power and renewable energy, which all topped Street forecast.Looking ahead, not only did GE affirm its industrial operating and verticals EPS outlook for 2017, the company said it expects cash flows to improve throughout the year.""We expect cash flows to improve throughout the remainder of the year, with no change to our full year cash flow framework,"" CEO Jeff Immelt said in a statement. ""We reaffirm our 2017 operating framework for Industrial operating + Verticals EPS, organic revenue growth and Industrial operating margin expansion.""The company, which in 2016 returned $30.5 billion to shareholders, said it returned $4.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter through a combination of dividends and buybacks.Bottom Line for GE StockGeneral Electric shares have declined by a little more than 4% year-to-date, but presents solid value for investors who are looking for strong dividend payer that can outperform the market in the next 12 to 18 months.How Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% ReturnsGE stock, which is currently priced at just 16 times fiscal 2018 estimates of $1.90 per share, looks like a solid bargain. Assuming General Electric does achieve $2 per share in 2018, this puts the forward P/E at 15, or four points below the S&P 500.If you apply a reasonable multiple of 18 to those estimates, General Electric's fair value points to $36, calling for 20% returns.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Chinese Internet Stocks to Buy for Explosive Growth3 French Stocks to Buy Ahead of Unprecedented ElectionsThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeThe postGeneral Electric Company Beats Q1 Earnings, GE Stock Has 20% Upsideappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Ocwen Hammered, Telsa Taps The Brakes;4/20/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Tech stocks are always on my mind but there are a few names that are dominating my screen today.  Let's go over what I am seeing and why it is important to investors.Ocwen Gets HammeredOcwen Financial(OCN) is down around 55% as I write this following a cease and desist order to Ocwen Loan Servicing.  This small cap financial services company has seen volume of about 29M shares so far today, but that is well 124M outstanding.The stock has been halted a few times, as investors continue to struggle to find a floor for  this stock.The lesson here is that when 20 states give you a cease and desist order, be ready to take a big loss.The halts allowed a few buyers to organize, but selling still look to be the order of the day for this stock.Tesla RecallCNET is reporting that approximately 53KTesla(TSLA) Model S and Model X cars are seeing a voluntary recall.  About 31K of those are located in the US and the recall is for cars made between February and October of 2016.TSLA has been in the news quite a bit and I recently wrote about howI expect the stock to go to $450.  With earnings a few weeks away the bears might have achieved a toe hold in the idea of TSLA not executing perfectly on its plan.Recall that more than 20% of TSLA stock is sold short and most are pointing to the valuation.  Some have mentioned that even if TSLA were to be making money their multiple would only be what other car company's sport (around a 5x-10x multiple).  The bulls however don't seem to mind that they are paying more for growth.The real surprise here is that the stock isn't down more!  As we look at the chart above the surge in volume shows that there are plenty of buyers around the $300 level.  Earning are due out on May 3, at which time a Model 3 update is expected.LessonsSometimes when the sellers hammer a stock they believe it is going to $0.00 and that might be the case with OCN.  Other times, there are buyers just waiting for a stock to give back some ground so they can get in.  Since I believe that TSLA is headed to $450, I would be a buyer on this weakness.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TSLA stock is down 1% on the day, and more than 2% from its intraday highs, remaining firmly within a monthlong trading range.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)Specifically, Tesla is recalling some of its Model S sedans and Model X crossovers for faulty electric parking brake assemblies on reports a small gear might fracture, preventing the brake from releasing. Tesla reports that about 2% of the recalled vehicles have the faulty gear.This isn't the first mechanical issue thecompany has faced.Separately, a group of owners have filed aclass-action lawsuitfor allegedly mischaracterizing the capabilities of the Autopilot 2 feature as safe and ""stress free"" when instead it is ""essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous."" Autopilot 2 went on sale last October as a $5,000 option. The first-generation Autopilot was launched in 2014.TSLA stock has been on the move largely, enjoying a massive near-30% rally out of its March low thanks to ramping vehicle production and a recent product tease announcement from CEO Elon Musk, hinting at the unveiling of the""Tesla Semi"" in September, a Tesla pickup truck in 18 to 24 months and a new roadster convertible.Apple Inc.

You've certainly seen it ifStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) is on your watch list. After months of dithering, the ubiquitous coffee company is finally on the move higher. And while the final destination is unknown, an all-time high of $64 for SBUX stock is as logical a target as any.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThis week's ascent places Starbucks shares firmly above all major moving averages. Moreover, they're all rising which confirms the dominance of buyers across all time frames.What's particularly telling is the stock's breach of the descending trendline that has defined its southward slog since SBUX peaked in October 2015. As illustrated below, this resistance zone has halted no less than six recovery attempts over the past 18 months.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixFortunately, this week's breakout bid succeeded where all the others failed. Above-average volume accompanied the launch suggesting buyers are flocking to SBUX. This adds legitimacy to the move increasing the likelihood that the breakout sticks. The RSI indicator lifted to the overbought zone for the first time since last November helping to confirm the strength of this move.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Won't Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) - But It Will Do ThisThe wild card for SBUX stock is the upcoming earning announcement slated for April 27th after market close. Positive technicals melt in the face of disappointing earnings every time.So here's to hoping the company delivers so this breakout pattern doesn't morph into a classic bull trap.The Trade on SBUX StockIf you're looking to lean bullish into SBUX earnings, but want to increase your margin of error, consider selling aMay $57.50/$55 bull put spread. The short vertical consists of selling to open the May $57.50 put while buying the May $55 put for a net credit of 37 cents.If SBUX stock sits above $57.50 at expiration, you will capture the max reward of 37 cents. The risk is limited to the distance between strikes minus the net credit, or $2.13, and will be forfeited if the stock falls below $55.By risking $2.13 to capture 37 cents, the spread offers a respectable 17.4% return.As of this writing, Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Longs: Don't Rock the Boardroom Too Much!5 Oil Stocks Collapsing Under the Crude Selloff3 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Sell Before They Take a DiveThe postStarbucks Corporation (SBUX) Is Busting a Move.

Does Toyota's Hydrogen Truck Torpedo Tesla's Truck Tweet?;4/20/2017;"Toyota Motor Corporation(NYSE: TM) revealed a surprise on Wednesday: The automaker has   created a hydrogen fuel cell system to power zero-emission   electric heavy trucks. Toyota engineers have installed a   prototype of the system in a heavily modified Kenworth 18-wheeler   that will soon begin operating in a test in California.This big rig is powered by electricity generated by Toyota     fuel cells. Image source: Toyota.makeArticleAd();A wrench in Tesla's truck plan?Toyota's surprise announcement came less than a week afterTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced thatTesla has an electric truck on the way:Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an   amazing job. Seriously next level.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 13, 2017Musk's tweet led at least one analyst todowngrade sharesof heavy-truck makerPACCAR(NASDAQ: PCAR) and diesel-engine giantCummins(NYSE: CMI)  on concerns that Tesla could emerge as a   dominant player in the market for zero-emission heavy trucks.   (That seems awfully premature, given that Tesla hasn't even shown   its truck, much less explained how, when, or in what factory   the truck will be built.)Toyota's announcement is a big warning for Tesla: The Silicon   Valley upstart isn't going to be the only player in that   game. And unlike Tesla, Toyota actually has a working   electric truck to show off right now.Why Toyota's truck is important -- and differentTesla's electric truck will almost certainly be powered by a   battery pack, similar to those used in its cars. But unless Tesla   has come up with a dramatic breakthrough, its battery-powered   heavy truck is likely to have a couple of drawbacks:The number of battery cells required to move an     80,000-pound vehicle several hundred miles is very large,     meaning that the battery pack in Tesla's truck is nearly     certain to be bulky, heavy, and expensive;That big battery pack will take a long time to recharge,     taking the truck out of service for several hours a day.In theory at least, fuel cells get around those disadvantages.   A fuel cell is a device that chemically converts the energy in   hydrogen gas to electricity. The only ""exhaust"" is water vapor,   and that can be collected and reused (it's just clean water). A   fuel cell system scaled for a tractor-trailer isn't huge or heavy   -- and it can be ""recharged"" in minutes, as long as there's a   hydrogen refueling station nearby.Toyota's electric fuel cell truck will be tested in daily     service in southern California starting this summer. Image     source: Toyota.Of course, unless you're in southern California, there aren't   likely to be hydrogen stations nearby. But while that's an   obstacle for fuel cell passenger cars, it seems like less of an   obstacle for long-haul tractor-trailers owned by a fleet operator   that can build its own strategically located stations along its   routes.That's the bet Toyota is making.About Toyota's hydrogen fuel cell truckToyota's system was developed over the last several months by   a secret ""skunk works"" team in Michigan. Working under the code   name ""Project Portal,"" the team drew on the fuel cell technology   developed for Toyota's Mirai sedan to create a system capable of   powering a 80,000-pound ""Class 8"" 18-wheeler in a manner   comparable to industry-standard diesel engines.The resulting system uses two of the fuel cell ""stacks""   developed for the Mirai, along with a 12 kilowatt-hour battery   pack. The system powers a single heavy-duty electric motor that   produces more than 670 horsepower and 1,327 pound-feet of torque.   That's right in the same neighborhood as Cummins' latest diesel   engines for tractor-trailer applications.Toyota's electric truck uses the fuel cell technology     developed for its Mirai sedan. Image source: Toyota.But unlike those diesels, Toyota's fuel cells don't pollute   the air. That makes air-quality regulators in California happy --   and it's no coincidence that Toyota's prototype will be tested in   southern California. The Project Portal truck will begin   operating at the Port of Los Angeles in a feasibility study this   summer, as part of the Port's ongoing Clean Air Action Plan.Is Toyota planning to build these fuel cell heavy   trucks?That's not clear yet. Toyota doesn't currently build Class 8   heavy trucks, though it does build light and medium commercial   trucks under its Hino Trucks brand. It could tool up to build   fuel cell heavy trucks on its own, or it could choose to partner   with an established truck builder. (It might be worth noting that   Toyota's prototype is installed in a Kenworth truck. Kenworth is   a PACCAR brand.)How well will Toyota's hydrogen truck compete?While it seems (very) likely that electric heavy trucks will   be coming to America's highways in the not-too-distant future,   most efforts to develop them are still in the early stages. It's   impossible to say right now how the competition will take shape.   But it's likely that Toyota's size, scale, and reputation for   quality will make it an instant major contender in this emerging   market --ifit chooses to enter.I think we'll know a lot more in a year or so, after Toyota   has had a chance to thoroughly evaluate its fuel cell truck in   daily operation -- and after we get a look at what Tesla and   others might be planning.10 stocks we like better than Toyota MotorWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Primed for Long-Term Strength;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCutting prices is generally a signal that a company is bowing to competition or, at best, sacrificing current cash flow in order to grab market share down the road. And then there'sTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), where Elon Musk's inherent reality distortion field flips the normal logic and turns what would otherwise be ominous margin pressure into confirmation that everything is right as rain.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTSLA stock currently lives and dies on its luxury car sales, so discounting the lower-end of the Model S series by $2,000 to $5,000 can cut into next quarter's top line by as much as $125 million.With the waiting list still running months behind deliveries, I don't see this as a brute attempt to sell a few more electric sedans to potential customers who were on the fence - Tesla has all the orders it can handle, and if you balk at a $74,000 car you'll probably keep balking at $69,000.Good News for TSLA Stock?What's really going on is an exponential increase in TSLA's production capacity. As the Nevada ""giga factory"" ramps up, capacity is on track to triple this year and double in 2018, so now is the time to start translating its market capitalization into real wheels on the road.After all, the moment is coming fast when Musk is going to have more cars than ever rolling off the line. He needs to shift the sales profile down toward the mass market, and this is part of that evolution. The really high end of the Tesla universe is actually getting more expensive because those cars are status symbols - someone who is paying $90,000 to $135,000 isn't really going to get sticker shock if it means an even more luxurious experience.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeIn the end, I expect the math will even out. And when it comes to the bottom line, Tesla stock may not be sacrificing much on the margins in order to move those additional cars. The lithium battery was always the big cost center behind all the space-age bells and whistles. With the giga-factory starting to achieve efficiencies of scale, Musk may be paying less than $10,000 for his ""low-end"" battery backs in a few months.If anything, he may be passing just about all of the savings on as an incentive for people to buy the cheapest Tesla models, but when you get up to the 90D and beyond, his margins are actually expanding. Those ""discounted"" models earn shareholders a little more on every single sale. As volume increases, so does profitability.And every month that giga-factory keeps scaling, unit costs drop toward the point where TSLA stock can compete head-to-head with over a century of industrial combustion and reach the mass market without losing money. Tinkering with the pricing shows that the company is still on course - the breakthrough moment may move back a few days or weeks, but next summer should be Musk's chance to change the world.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

What's more, the older generations are still firmly tied to their Facebook pages.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn fact, asJosh Enomoto puts it, ""Twitter does not offer a useful platform unless you're a celebrity, journalist or social media guru."" Twitter has essentially become a glorifiedRSS feed, one that has seen its ad revenue flowing out to more profitable social media locations. As such, there is currently no compelling reason to own TWTR.However, for short-term investors and speculative options traders like myself, Twitter stock offers a potentially lucrative opportunity.TWTR will step onto the earnings stage on Wednesday next week. The consensus is calling for a year-over-year plunge in earnings from 15 cents per share to a penny. What's more, revenue is seen dropping 13.9% to $511.91 million. For regular Twitter followers, these eroding fundamentals are no surprise.TWTR Stock's Earnings OutlookWhat would be a surprise to nearly everyone on Wall Street would be an earnings beat. And it's not such a far-fetched possibility. In fact, EarningsWhispers.com reports that Twitter's whisper number comes in at 5 cents per share, well above the current consensus. If the company can come anywhere near this figure, and not offer up abysmal guidance, Twitter stock should rally.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeAs I alluded to above, don't expect this quarterly report to offer any long-term buying opportunities. The rally I'm looking for is a short-term, knee-jerk reaction for a stock beaten down and mired in bearish sentiment. TWTR is oversold and trading near all-time lows, increasing the likelihood of short-term buying power on any positive news.Furthermore, expectations are near rock bottom for Twitter stock as well. For instance, Thomson/First Call reports that only four of the 38 analysts following TWTR rate the shares a ""buy,"" with 13 outright ""sell"" ratings. Additionally, Twitter stock is trading north of the consensus 12-month price target of $14.05.In other words, there is plenty of coverage and more than a little wiggle room for target increases or ratings shifts, and Twitter only has to convince one or two analysts to upgrade with next week's quarterly report.A short-squeeze situation is also a possibility, if a remote one. Following a 7% jump in short interest during the most recent reporting period, more than 70 million shares of Twitter stock are now sold short - representing a sizeable 11.4% of the stock's float. I wouldn't expect long-term TWTR bears to cover on a post-earnings rally, but the weaker hands could be forced into buying back their bets and adding to a short-term spike.Click to EnlargeFinally, options traders appear to be preparing for a short-term jump in Twitter stock. The 28 April put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0.37, with calls nearly tripling puts among those options most affected by TWTR's earnings report. This ratio rises sharply to 0.77 for the May series, reinforcing the idea of a short-term, earnings induced rally.Overall, 28 April implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 9.5% for Twitter stock. This places the upper bound at about $15.87, while the lower bound lies at $13.13. Should Twitter surprise with next week's report, the shares could easily challenge resistance at $16 after overcoming their 50-day moving average near $15.50. Meanwhile, the $14 region remains a firm floor for TWTR stock, barring anything short of a complete debacle.2 Trades for Twitter StockCall Spread:For those looking to take a risk and bet on a contrarian post-earnings rally for Twitter stock, a May $15/$16 bull call spread has plenty of potential. I'm looking at May so as to provide more room for the rally to play out, and because 28 April implieds will eat into returns.At last check, the May $15/$16 bull call spread was offered at 27 cents, $27 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $15.27, while a maximum profit of 73 cents, or $73 per pair of contracts, is possible if Twitter stock closes at or above $16 when May options expire.Trade Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock at All-Time HighsPut Spread:For those looking for a more conservative play (relatively speaking), then a 28 April $13 put should remain out of the money through expiration. At last check, this put was bid at 19 cents, or $19 per contract.As long as TWTR trades above $13 through the close of trading next Friday, traders who open this position will keep the initial premium received. However, if Twitter stock trades below $13 before expiration, you may be assigned 100 shares for each contract sold at a cost of $13 each.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Energy Stocks That Will Turn 2017 on Its Head3 High-Yield BDCs With Excellent Dividend CoverageTesla Inc (TSLA) Longs: Don't Rock the Boardroom Too Much!The postThe Contrarian Case for a Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Earnings Rallyappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Buy Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock … Once It Cools Off;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet's not mince words.Starbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) is a great American success story, and so is SBUX stock. However, Starbucks is entering a new era.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt's worth examining what has happened thus far with the company to understand why SBUX stock is likely about to cool off in the near-term, but still looks great for the long-term.After all, it's the long-term that ultimately matters, and that's what my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio, focuses on.The Starbucks StoryThe reason Starbucks found success was not because it served coffee. It's because it created a location between work and home where people could meet. There wasn't any obvious location for such a thing until SBUX came around.Think about it. When you need to meet with someone, what's the easiest thing that comes to mind? If you are in any urban area, Starbucks as a meeting location is probably one of the top three things to hit you.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeOf course, Starbucks also sold an addictive product, which didn't hurt.It could have stopped there, but it didn't. It moved its coffee into grocery stores. It made ice cream. In its own stores, it added ice blended drinks, flavored coffees, teas and juices (via acquisition), snack food boxes and eventually pastries. Then it moved into breakfast offerings to compete with the fast-food chains.And SBUX stock did very well amidst all this expansion.However, operationally speaking, things have started to slow down a bit. The recent run in shares is belying this fact.SBUX is hardly in trouble - it's just starting to plateau as it reaches a zillion stores around the globe. It's not that the concept or the stores are getting tired and old, likeMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD). It's not that there's no growth - it's just that growth isn't what it was. The numbers just suggest that it's time for a reboot.CEO Howard Schultz kicked himself upstairs to Executive Chairman, where he will be developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, expand the Reserve retails stores, and more ominously for this investor, ""social impact initiatives.""What does this mean?The COO might need a little time to get adjusted. The Chief Operating Officer knows how to operate the business, not innovate. He's there to keep tight watch on the company and make sure it continues to execute, make money, generate cash flow and not flail.There's probably some growth to be squeezed here and there, but for the most part, the COO moving to CEO smells like SBUX is going to cool off from its current burst.Still, there's the long-term to think about.Bottom Line on SBUX StockWhile Starbucks is currently trying to make a run on its 2015 highs around $63, I think shares are about to stall out. I doubt it will go much higher in the near-term so even selling some covered calls several months out may squeeze more upside out of your long position than just holding it.But don't sell Starbucks stock if you own it.Starbucks 3.0 is going to do very, very well. See, Schultz isn't an operator so much as an innovator. He has done very well when it comes to innovation. When he emerges with his concepts and they start rolling it out, that's when Starbucks may re-enter its growth phase.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Longs: Don't Rock the Boardroom Too Much!Right now, though, SBUX stock trades at nearly 30 times net income. While analysts see 15% annualized growth over the next five years, and Starbucks deserves a premium for its cash flow and brand name, I think 30x is too expensive given the phase it's about to enter. So I wouldn't buy the stock here.But I think the stock market as a whole is overvalued, and believe a true correction is coming. If it does, SBUX will take a haircut. Ideally, something around 20% to 30% would make things a whole lot more interesting for true value buyers.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, a specialty lender focusing on consumer finance.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Longs: Don’t Rock the Boardroom Too Much!;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether investors want to admit it or not, one of the most fascinating parts of theTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) story is CEO Elon Musk. He's brilliant and brash, intelligent yet immature, and frank while frightening. He's not unlike shock-jock DJ Howard Stern. And both TSLA stock owners - and non-owners - love to follow the saga just because they have no idea what Musk might say or do next.makeArticleAd();Source:Chris Brown Via FlickrThere are times, however, where the best thing to say is absolutely nothing at all.Last week was one of those times.It will blow over; it always does. But Musk probably should have thought it out beforetweeting""This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing"" to a group of Tesla stock holders concerned that the company's board of directors isn't quite independent enough.While Tesla's (and Musk's) usual fans quickly came to his support, the comparison toFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) not only showed a lack of discretion - it opened the door to closer scrutiny of governance at Tesla.A Brilliant Comparison to MakeMusk's tweet was in response to a letter he received on Monday from an ad hoc group of Tesla stock owners - presumably institutional investors - pointing out the conflicts of interest built into the board. Thegroup's specific concern:""We expect that as companies make the transition to publicly-traded status, the governance structures and practices in place at the time of the IPO will evolve to align with the company's changing strategy. However, Tesla's seven-member board is largely unchanged from its pre-IPO days.""His reference to Ford's governance may not have been coincidental, taking a shot at the uncanny amount of influence the Ford family has over the company.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeEach ""family"" share of Ford isgranted 16 voteson all matters that require shareholder involvement (like selecting directors), as opposed to just one vote per share of ordinary Ford stock. This effectively means the family controls about 40% of the company's voting power, even without owning anywhere near 40% of outstanding shares.Non-family shareholders have attempted to change Ford's lopsided control structure, but not surprisingly, have failed to get enough votes to do so.From that angle, Musk may have a valid point about being left alone; it could be worse. Nevertheless, such a comment only draws even more attention to the matter, giving the Tesla stock owner base a reason to look more closely at the company's ownership allocation … and the board.More investors may not like what they find.Keeping It in the FamilyAs of the latest look, Musk - who is the chairman of the board as well as the Tesla's CEO - owns roughly 22% of outstanding TSLA stock by himself. Otherboard membersinclude Elon's brother and formerSolarCity(which Tesla acquired last year) CFO Kimbal Musk, Steve Jurvetson, Robyn Denholm, Gracias Ehrenpreis, and Ira Ehrenpreis. Both Ehrenpreis's are investors in another of Elon Musk's venture,SpaceX(Gracias runs it, in fact), while Jurvetson is also a director of SpaceX.Director Brad Buss doesn't seemingly have any familial ties or inappropriate business links to Tesla or Musk. But a closer look at his dossier reveals he was previously CFO of SolarCity, and like Musk, benefited greatly from the acquisition. (Elon was also a 22% owner of SolarCity.)So, from that perspective, the group of concerned investors may have a valid point. A bunch of people on the board are in one way or another beholden to Musk. Never mind the fact that he's the chairman as well as the chief, and is only, ultimately, held accountable by himself.Bottom Line for Tesla StockTo his credit, following Wednesday's tweet Musk added that the company waslooking to add two more directors to the board. Although he denies the pressure from the group of investors has anything to do with it - and it probably doesn't - this isn't likely the first time he's heard the concern. He knows it's only a matter of time before more owners jump on the bandwagon and apply even more pressure.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Are Solid Long-Term BuysAll the same, it remains to be seen how ""independent"" those two directors will be. Odds are, Musk will somehow maintain a high degree of control in the boardroom.Does it inherently make Tesla stock a sell? No, it doesn't. Whether appropriate or not, the structure works in this particular case because it caters to Musk's amazing vision. Either you're okay with it, or you're not. The near 800% gain TSLA shares have mustered since the end of 2012, however, says maybe investors might be just as well off leaving things alone.At least for the time being.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyUnder Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Stumbles by Going the Apple Way5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsThe postTesla Inc (TSLA) Longs: Don't Rock the Boardroom Too Much!appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Stock Drops After Earnings (As It Should);4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite a valiant effort to stop the shrinking of its top and bottom line,Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) just can't seem find a groove. Concerned shareholders sent VZ stock 2.1% lower following what can only be categorized as a disappointing first-quarter report from the company.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrAll told, Verizon earned an operating profit of 95 cents per share, versus analyst expectations of a profit of 97 cents per share. Analysts were also calling for sales of $30.57 billion for the quarter ending in March, but the telecom giant only produced $29.8. billion worth of revenue. Verizon reported $32.17 billion in revenue and $1.06 per share of profits in the year-ago quarter.CEO Lowell McAdam said of the Verizon earnings numbers:""Our first-quarter results again demonstrated that customers value a high-quality network experience. To build on our loyal customer base and the third-party recognition we have received for network leadership, we extended our wireless and fiber network capabilities, began offering an unlimited pricing option and expanded our opportunities in new markets""The wireless (and wireline) service provider launched the unlimited data plan in February, which arguably helped the company attract and keep customers. Before the new package was made available, Verizon had lost  398,000 postpaid customers. After the plan was introduced, it added 109,000 connections. All told, the company lost 307,000 postpaid customers in its first quarter. Postpaid churn was 1.15%.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyWhatever the case, the adverse fiscal impact of Verizon Unlimited is clear.The new pricing plan isn't solely to blame for the quarter's fiscal weakness. Verizon missed itsprior quarter's earnings estimate as well- the first miss since the last quarter of 2014. This second shortcoming implies analysts didn't fully appreciate the competitive headwind that VZ ran into near the end of last year.Verizon Is Shifting StrategiesThe telecom icon is still a powerhouse, not only boasting the most U.S. wireless market share, but remaining a cash cow. Growth has been a struggle though, ever sinceSprint Corp(NYSE:S) introduced its ""cut your bill in half"" promotion over a year ago, andT-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS) began offering nearly free smartphones. RivalAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) put just as much pressure on Verizon around that time as well, however, axing its two-year contract requirement.The end result was a price war that took a toll on all the industry's players; last quarter's lull was nothing VZ stock holders haven't seen before.The proposed solution thus far for some of the industry's leaders has been melding wireless service providers with media names, blurring the lines between the two in an effort to sell (and cross-sell) new packages.AT&T is credited as the first to think outside the box,acquiring satellite television giantDirecTVback in 2015. It's currently working toward a union with studioTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX), which would allow it to be the message and the messenger.Verizon is no stranger to lateral acquisitions, though. Itbought internet venueAOLand all of its web properties back in 2015. VZ reportedly has done well with it, although AOL's revenue was off 4% last quarter on a year-over-year basis.Now Verizon is looking to replicate that success with AOL via the purchase ofYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO).In fact, Yahoo's last quarterly report as its own publicly traded entity was posted earlier this week … an ironic improvement in revenue, and a respectable increase in income. The company had been losing ground for years, leading some to believe Verizon was still overpaying for the web business despitethe discount offered at the 11th hour. With a much-needed rebound on the books, though, perhaps Verizon doesn't have as much work cut out for it as some suspected.That being said, McAdam noted earlier in the week he was open to more M&A in the future, and wasparticularly interested in deals that beef up Verizon's media delivery and 5G networking capabilities. McAdam even made a point of referencingComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) andWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) as possible partners, though he certainly didn't limit his options to those players. Both of those companies, however, would give Verizon a weapon to wield against a Time-Warner/AT&T (and DirecTV) combo.Nevertheless, Verizon still operates a telecom business, and must remain competitive on that front particularly with the advent of 5G connectivity representing a new battleground.Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhonesThe company didn't win any new spectrum in the most recent FCC auction, but it did ink a deal withCorning Incorporated(NYSE:GLW) this week, agreeing to purchase at least $1.0 billion worth of fiberoptic cable from the company over the course of the coming three years. This suggests Verizon is aiming to keep a big portion of its customer connectivity running through physical lines rather than radio waves, but also ramp-up its Fios business - which can support television, phone, and internet services. Its Fios revenue was up 4.7% last quarter.Looking Ahead for VZ StockVerizon didn't offer specific profit or revenue guidance for the quarter currently underway, or for the full year. It only noted it expected this year's top and bottom line to essentially look like 2016's tallies. The company added it was looking for a rebound in wireless and equipment revenue later this year to offset the slow start.Analysts have been more specific, calling for earnings of 99 cents per share on revenue of $30.35 billion.For the whole year, analysts were modeling a bottom line of $3.81 per share of VZ stock on sales of $124.53 billion. Both would be down from last year's levels, although those forecasts don't factor in the addition of Yahoo's numbers. That deal should be finalized within the next few weeks, and reflected in the second quarter results due in mid-July.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in T.More From InvestorPlaceGeneral Electric Company (GE) Q1 Earnings Will Make or Break the StockHow Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% ReturnsThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeThe postVerizon Communications Inc.

Why Investors Should Have Known Tesla's SolarCity Acquisition Was a Bad Business Decision;4/20/2017;"WhenTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought SolarCity in late 2016, it was supposed to   create a vertically integrated renewable energy company. People   thought Elon Musk could marry EV sales with solar and combine   SolarCity's installation arm with Tesla's Powerwall to create a   path for customers to eventually go off-grid -- or at least   charge their car with solar energy. When the solar roof was shown   off last fall, the expectations got even higher.But if we're looking objectively at Tesla's solar business   today, it's largely a bust. Tesla is shrinking SolarCity, has   already shut down its solar technology in favor of white label   panels fromPanasonic, and hasn't shown any progress integrating solar into Tesla   showrooms. And withcompetitorsinresidential solar going bankrupt, you have to wonder if Musk bailed out his solar company to save   himself hundreds of millions of dollars and keep from tarnishing   his impeccable reputation on the stock market.Image source: Tesla. Tesla's solar roof may be a big     distraction from Tesla slowing SolarCity's operations.makeArticleAd();Tesla is winding down solarDespite Elon Musk talking positively about solar, make no   mistake: Tesla is slowing down SolarCity's solar business. In the   fourth quarter of 2016,solar installations were 201 MW, down from 272 MW a year earlier. Full-year 2016 installations   were 803 MW,down from 870 MW a year earlier.As late as third-quarter 2016 earnings results, SolarCity's   management expected the company to keep growing. They guided for   900 MW in full-year installations, implying around 300 MW of   installs for the fourth quarter. Once Tesla took control, the   number of installations dropped -- and the future for the   business doesn't look much better.Tesla's solar business is now less competitiveA recent study by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL)showed that quotes from large, national installers   were priced $0.33, or about 10%, higher than smaller local or regional installers.   And as customers move toward more loan and cash sales versus   leases and loans, the advantage national installers had with   scale is dissipating.Tesla's newly acquired solar unit may actually have higher   costs than competitors, and it doesn't have a differentiated   product, either.New solar panels aren't really new at allWhen Tesla bought SolarCity, it was buying a company that had   a solar manufacturing plant under construction in Buffalo, New   York. The plant was supposed to make high-efficiency solar panels   based on technology acquired from Silevo.But even before the deal closed, Tesla signed a deal that   wouldbring Panasonic in as a partner and cut Silevo   technology out. Now, it appears the solar panels Tesla has introduced are just   rebranded Panasonic panels. And with Panasonic running the   Buffalo plant -- dubbed ""Gigafactory 2"" -- Tesla doesn't have a   new or differentiated product at all. It's just installing   Panasonic panels.The solar roof could be a new product, but we know very little   about it. And until we do, investors shouldn't put much stock in   the new product.Tesla hasn't proven it can sell solar at allWe have yet to see solar end up in Tesla's stores, and I'm   skeptical it will ever be a big business. Tesla's focus in 2017   and 2018 has to be on selling the Model 3, and solar would be a   huge distraction from that.Even if Tesla does start selling solar in stores, there's no   guarantee it will be a success. And with the traditional solar   sales business struggling, the showroom is key to Tesla's solar   future.How Musk & Family cashed in on the SolarCity     dealWhat's becoming increasingly clear about Tesla's buyout of   SolarCity is that it was a huge benefit to Musk and his cousins   Lyndon and Peter Rive. Thethree had $100 million of solar bonds issued by   SolarCity, bonds that were recently bought back by Tesla. The three will   have bonds transfered to Tesla under the same terms, unlike   outside investors, but would you rather have a struggling   SolarCity owe you $100 million, or market darling Tesla, who has   easy access to equity markets?The debt is on top of the 22.2 million SolarCity shares that   Musk turned into Tesla shares and the 2.3 million shares the   Rives converted. Had SolarCity gone bankrupt, as some major   residential solar rivals have done, rather than being bought by   Tesla, they would have lost hundreds of millions combined.A bailout of their SolarCity stake to save Musk and the Rives   hundreds of millions is worth considering when you see   SolarCity's operations being shut down and manufacturing being   turned over to Panasonic. At this point, it doesn't look like the   SolarCity acquisition was a good deal at all. Musk could prove   that wrong eventually, but so far, there's little indication he   has much interest in growing solar under Tesla's umbrella.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

General Electric Company (GE) Q1 Earnings Will Make or Break the Stock;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Electric(NYSE:GE) is scheduled to report its latest earnings on Friday, April 21, before the start of trading for the day. GE stock has largely trended higher over the years, but over the past 12 months, it looks to have traced out a potentially bearish-looking pattern on the charts.makeArticleAd();Depending on how strong GE reacts (in either direction) following Friday's report, this could signal the beginning of either a significant breakdown, or a new leg higher and a continuation of a multiyear trend.The industrial sector (to which GE belongs) of theS&P 500is higher by about 3.7% year-to-date. While that's not significantly worse than the broader stock market, on the below ratio chart, we see that the relative underperformance has led to a pullback right after reaching  horizontal resistance last December.Click to EnlargeIf industrial stocks like GE come alive again after their respective upcoming earnings reports, the relative strength should pick up again, too. That in turn would lead to a break higher and out of the year-to-date consolidation phase.On the other hand, if industrial stocks like General Electric weaken further after earnings, this ratio chart could easily revisit its recent lows from last November.5 Oil Stocks Collapsing Under the Crude SelloffBut enough of the relative view. Let's look at the actual charts of General Electric.GE Stock ChartsFirst, from a multiyear perspective, we see that since coming out of the financial crisis in 2009, General Electric has largely traded higher in a well-defined uptrend.Click to EnlargeThe lower end of this uptrend currently also coincides with the blue 100-week simple moving average. That is to say, a break below the $29-$30 area would be a significant daily event.On the daily chart, note that although GE stock remains in a bigger-picture uptrend, over the past 15 months or so, shares have developed a series of failed rallies that are visibly putting weight on the black diagonal support line.Click to EnlargeOver the past couple of months, GE stock has done very little and keeps consolidating below its 100- and 200-day simple moving averages, which also act as important near- to possibly intermediate-term resistance.Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Beats on Q2 Earnings, But It's Still a TrapIf General Electric stock moves at least a couple percent in either direction after Friday's earnings report, then one of two trades could set up.A break and hold above $30.70 could set up a trade to the upside and ultimately back toward the upper end of the longer-standing trading channel in the mid- to high $30s. This would simply mean a continuation of the longer-standing trend.A break and hold below $29 after earnings would break the aforementioned bigger uptrend and point toward price targets around $28 and $27.Like what you see?

Apple Won't Be First to Augmented Reality, but Can It Be the Best?;4/19/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is very rarely a first mover, and CEO Tim Cook   often points out that the company's goal is never to be the first   at something -- it just wants to be the best. The iPod wasn't the   first music player, the iPhone wasn't the first smartphone, and   the iPad wasn't the first tablet. There are more examples.WithFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) making abig official pushinto augmented reality (AR) yesterday, complementing its virtual   reality (VR) efforts, will the same scenario play out once again   for the Mac maker?Mark Zuckerberg at F8 2017 unveiling Facebook's AR platform.     Image source: Facebook.makeArticleAd();Hardware is hardCook has madeno secretof how much potential he sees in AR, believing that the nascent   technology could be truly transformative since unlike VR, AR   doesn't isolate you from the real world. In characteristic   fashion, don't expect Apple to unveil whatever it's up to until   the company feels like it's ready for mainstream adoption. In   contrast, Facebook is taking the more traditional Silicon Valley   approach of incremental iteration.The social network's new Camera Effects Platform currently   just focuses on photo and video filters as a form of expression.   Apple's new Clips app offers similar functionalities, which may   very well be the foundations of its AR strategy, but Apple isn't   calling anything a ""platform"" quite yet like Facebook is. Apple   is also expected to include some AR functionalities in upcoming   iPhones, potentially as early as this year. Longer term, both   companies appear to be working onAR glassesas the delivery mechanism for an AR platform.The hardware will be a critically important aspect, and   fashion preferences have a lot of bearing on wearable technology.Alphabet's Google Glass was too early for its time, and the super   futuristic aesthetic was alienating, which may have contributed   to that device's failure. Facebook is relatively new to the   hardware game, but has been beefing up its hardware talent. The   company poached Rich Heley last year fromTeslato join its Building 8 hardware team, where he currently serves   as head of manufacturing; Heley was previously a hardware   director at Apple.Meanwhile, hardware is one of Apple's greatest strengths, so   expectations around Apple AR glasses will be (and should be)   quite high. Apple also has much more experience constructing and   operating computing platforms (as opposed to a social platform)   on a massive scale. Additionally, Apple can leverage its broader   product ecosystem to deliver more integrated AR experiences that   leverage other Apple products a customer might have.The odds are stacked in the Mac maker's favor.AR platforms may not be mutually exclusiveIt's worth pointing out that AR platforms may not be mutually   exclusive. While the primary platform may very well be tied to   what hardware a customer buys, it's quite conceivable that in   addition to making AR glasses, Facebook could build its platformon topof other platforms, too, much like its current social platform is   primarily built on third-party mobile platforms like iOS and   Android.If Apple's underlying AR platform proves to be more   successful, with greater mainstream adoption, there wouldn't be   anything stopping Facebook from creating an AR app for Apple's   platform to deliver the AR experiences that Zuckerberg envisions.   On the flip side, it's unlikely that Apple would pursue such a   strategy, as it always sticks to its own walled garden.It's still early days in AR, and the coming years will see   major AR investments and competition from all the major tech   giants.

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Beats on Q2 Earnings, But It’s Still a Trap;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor a moment, it looked like a bit of good news forQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM). QCOM stock jumped in after-hours trading after the company's fiscal second-quarter report included beats on both the top and bottom lines.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockQualcomm stock was up as much as 3% after initially declining, but it has since given back some of its post-earnings gains. All eyes are on the post-earnings conference call, however, as investors look to get more information onthe company's legal battlewithApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).But on the numbers alone? Well, Qualcomm earnings weren't bad … but they weren't nearly strong enough to get investor attention shifted elsewhere.Qualcomm Earnings: The Good NewsQualcomm admittedly reported strong Q2 numbers.Adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share beat estimates by 14 cents. Meanwhile, non-GAAP revenue of $6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, was a point and a half ahead of the Street's growth projections.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeQualcomm recorded strength in its QCT (chip) business - the one area in which QCOM has some degree of control. Licensing revenues and profits largely are based on shipments by Qualcomm customers - it's not as if Qualcomm has much influence over how many smartphones are shipped within a given quarter.The QCT numbers were good, to be sure. Revenue increased 10% and EBT (earnings before taxes) rose a whopping 179% year-over-year. EBT margins moved from a narrow 5% to a much more healthy 13%. Guidance for Q3 suggests that margin improvement will hold, at least in the near term.That's a notable step forward in Qualcomm reducing its reliance on the licensing business - because that is the business that worries investors at the moment.Qualcomm Earnings: The Bad NewsThe problem is that even a stronger QCT barely moves the needle for Qualcomm, and QCOM stock, as a whole. The licensing business (QTL) EBT was still more thanquadruplethat of QCT in Q2.That QTL business did have a solid quarter, with revenue rising 5% and margins holding flat, as 3G and 4G smartphone shipments rose 20%. But the Apple concerns still weigh.In its Q2 presentation, Qualcomm said that Q3 guidance was wider than usual - EPS is projected between 90 cents and $1.15 per share - because of uncertainty as to whether AAPL suppliers would withhold royalties due. That's also somewhat disappointing compared to the consensus of $1.09.And even that wide range doesn't include a scenario whereallof Apple's suppliers withhold royalties.The potential impact of the Apple dispute still isn't known - and could still rear its head at some point over the next few quarters. That's not going to do enough for investor confidence to get QCOM stock out of its current rut.Adding to the worries about the near future, smartphone shipments are expected to be much more moderate over the rest of calendar 2017. Qualcomm is projecting 3%-9% growth year-over-year - which against a 20% figure implies a flat or even contracting market over the next three quarters. In that context, the Q2 beat looks far less impressive. It simply looks as if Qualcomm had some profits move into the quarter and out of fiscal Q3.How Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% ReturnsAnd it looks as if the Apple issue still remains potentially damaging for Qualcomm stock.Stay Away From QCOM StockAll told, Qualcomm's fiscal Q2 just wasn't enough. I've considered the companya value trapfor some time, and the Q2 numbers don't change that opinion.The post-earnings conference call will give more detail, but until investors understand the potential impact of lower royalties, QCOM stock remains an avoid at best.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceRite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Must DieCommit to Apple Inc.

Dougherty Drops Tesla Price Target From $500 to $375;4/19/2017;"AmidTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)  shares' rally to record highs, analysts and   investors continue pontificating on where they'll go from here.   Optimism around the forthcoming Model 3 launch is invigorating   bulls, while the incredibly lofty valuation levels are feeding   the bears.Dougherty analysts Charles Anderson and Jessica McHugh are now   dropping the firm's price target on Tesla from $500 to $375,   according toBarron's. That's a pretty big cut, but the underlying reason may not be   what you think.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Changing methodologyThe prior $500 price target was set by analyst Andrea James,   who left Dougherty in May of last year to start an executive   coaching practice. A few months later in September 2016, Tesla   head of investor relations Jeff Evanson recruited her as an   investor relations associate/consultant; Evanson and James had   both worked together at Dougherty before Tesla hired Evanson in   2011 to lead its IR function.Anderson inherited Tesla's coverage from James, including both   her rating and price target, which he reiterated last year.   However, the methodology that James used to derive her price   target was a bit odd: Her model estimated 2025 earnings and then   discounted those profits back to arrive at a $500 price target.   On one hand, a long-term focus makes sense for a company like   Tesla, since so much of the valuation is predicated on future   performance, but price targets are often 12-month targets.   Anderson is changing the methodology to ""gain consistency with   the 12-month Price Target view of the rest of our coverage   universe.""The new $375 price target is derived from 30 times estimated   2020 earnings of $12.49. To get there, the analyst is modeling   for a 35% compound annual growth rate from 2017 through 2020,   which Anderson believes justifies that earnings multiple.   Dougherty is still bullish overall, and believes that Tesla still   enjoys a ""substantial lead in battery technology"" and much   greater brand strength, citing the 350,000-plus Model 3   reservations that the company has gathered with no   advertising.Using 2020 estimates is more reasonable, as longer-term   estimates are generally less reliable since so much can happen   between now and 2025, especially for a company like Tesla.   There's also more visibility into Tesla's ambitions, as the   company said a year ago that it hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles   in 2018 and ramp to 1 million vehicles by 2020. Whether or not   Tesla can actually pull off those ambitious goals is another   topic altogether.While the prior $500 price target was the Street highby far, the new $375 price target is still the Street high, just not by   as wide a margin. That target still represents over 20% upside   from current levels. Even Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jones, one   of the most prominent Street bulls, only has a price target of   $305, which is roughly where shares are currently trading.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How to Trade Netflix Stock While It’s on the Ropes (NFLX);4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsQuarterly earnings are just starting to accelerate this week with several big-name stocks announcing. So far, there have been a few surprises, with a couple of familiar names moving lower after reporting, includingGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) andInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM)The one familiar stock I want to focus on today however isNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX)for the reasons I will discuss below.makeArticleAd();Just recently,Luke Langowrote about how investors need to look past certain numbers when it comes to NFLX and focus on what is important. He thinks the company's changes - including cutting some original content, which has led to more profitability - could impress investors over the long haul.Lucky for us, this trade idea on NFLX stock is not meant for the long haul.But before we go any further, let's talk a little bit about an option strategy that I frequently consider. It is a vertical call credit spread. Essentially, it is a bearish trade but it does have some special nuances to it. Depending on how it is implemented, the strategy can profit if the stock moves lower, stays the same or even moves higher. The ability to profit in this caliber is what gives options an advantage over other trading vehicles in my opinion.Let's take a look below.An Option Strategy for NFLX StockThe rationale:This trade idea is built upon the idea that Netflix won't move decisively higher. What better than to have multiple potential areas of resistance in its way, then?Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Correct, But Don't WorryTaking a look at the chart just below the stock is currently trading below its 50-day simple moving average. Moving averages are often considered form of support, and in this case potential resistance. In addition, the stock has twice tested the $148 area - which was close to its all-time high ($148.29) - and failed. This might be an additional potential resistance area for NFLX stock in case it does try to move higher before the options expire.Click to EnlargeWhat could help this trade idea profit even quicker is a move lower. Netflix stock has now traded down to a potential support area at $140. This area has kept the stock from moving much lower after gapping above the area in the middle of January.But just because support has a better chance of holding Netflix stock up for the time being, doesn't mean that it will bounce and move much higher again.The Trade:Sell the May $150 call and buy the May $155 call for a credit of 50 cents or more.The Strategy:The maximum potential profit for this trade is 50 cents if NFLX stock is trading at or below $150 at May expiration. Both call options would expire worthless. The maximum loss is $4.50 ($5 - $0.50) if NFLX is trading at or above $155 at May expiration. Breakeven is $150.50 at expiration based on a credit of 50 cents.Why would an options trader risk nine times what they are willing to make?How Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% ReturnsThe odds. With the current delta of the short call at the time of this writing at around 0.18, many option traders will say the option has an 18% chance of expiring in-the-money (ITM). That means based on the ""option trader's definition"" of delta, there is an 82% chance of the option expiring out-of-the-money (OTM) and worthless leading to max profit.Like I mentioned above, the stock can move lower, sideways and higher as long as it does not close above the breakeven point at option's expiration. And you can consider exiting this position ahead of expirationGood luck!John Kmiecik is the head options instructor for Market Taker Mentoring, and co-author of the eBook 3 Secrets to Making Money in Any Market.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Correct, But Don’t Worry;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe semiconductor business isn't an easy one. After struggling for the first three years of this decade,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) finally gained traction in 2013. It wasn't until 2016, though, that Nvidia stock truly justified its existence in most investors' portfolios. And what a year it was - NVDA returned an astonishing 233%, a resurgence in semiconductors boosting the tech industry!makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTo put the performance of NVDA stock into perspective, it was the second-biggest annual haul in corporate history. The all-time greatest return was a massive 347% profit. However, that occurred eons ago in 2001.Since then, only two years registered triple-digit returns - 2009 and 2016. In all fairness, the former could be considered a ""sympathy rally"" since the markets died a year earlier. But now, questions are surfacing as to whether Nvidia stock has gas left in the tank.Click to EnlargeYear-to-date, NVDA is down more than 6%. All of the negativity is attributed to this month's performance, where shares have dropped 12%.The semiconductor industry is no confidence boost, as sector benchmarks like theMarket Vectors Semiconductor ETF(NYSEARCA:SMH) andTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund(NYSEARCA:XLK) are also on the short end of the stick this month.Should investors jump ship from Nvidia stock before things get any worse?A Natural Correction Is in Order for Nvidia StockThe obvious answer is that it depends on your particular position. If you've enjoyed the benefits of a 230% return, securing a good chunk of those profits is only natural. Furthermore, another crack at three digits is a mighty big challenge. Indeed, NVDA stock has never recorded back-to-back returns of 100% or higher.5 Fortune 500 CEOs Who Are Lucky to Have JobsInterested parties that arrived on the scene a bit late have a much harder job. Nobody wants to hold the bag, especially on an investment like Nvidia stock that has already tripled in value.It's a sentimentwell-expressed by InvestorPlace contributor Joseph Hargett, who stated that the recent volatility ""shouldn't be unexpected for Nvidia shareholders, as many speculative investors are looking to take profits following NVDA's blockbuster rally in 2016."" In addition, no publicly-traded asset continues to run higher indefinitely. Every bull market has a period of consolidation before their next leg up.Although Nvidia stock is definitely declining, this is a controlled descent. An example of a non-controlled descent is the unfoldinglegal dramafromQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM). With that company, you have no idea how things will turn out for both the short and long run. NVDA stock is a different animal. The market is merely washing out the weak hands to make room for the next leg.We have to remember that Nvidia stock was a huge beneficiary of the so-called ""Trump rally."" Between election day until the end of 2016, NVDA gained more than 50%. There's no way that such an enormous catalyst would not later face a consolidation phase.Way More Good Than Bad for NvidiaThe deciding factor as to which way Nvidia stock will swing is fundamental strength. When you break it down, it's hard to justify going against the chipmaker.Take a look at the growth and profitability metrics for NVDA stock. With operating and net margins averaging 26%, this is wellabove the industrymedian. Even taking out the impact of its recent acquisitions, NVDA comes out on top. The same can be said about the company's top-line sales. Currently, its trailing three-year revenue growth rate is over 15%. Global semiconductors on average are lucky to hit 3%.The balance sheet for NVDA stock is also quite stable. Controlling its liability picture, Nvidia is maintaining a respectable balance between cash and debt. That's a smart move, considering that the floor underneath can be ripped away in the semiconductor sector.Finally, investors can take great encouragement by NVDA's push toward high-demand specialties. Whether it's video games or self-automated driving, the Nvidia brand represents leadership in cutting-edge technologies. The latter is particularly alluring, as automation is rapidlybecoming the norm.Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Must DieWhile I don't expect Nvidia stock to rally for another 230% this year, that doesn't mean investors should ignore it. Human nature dictates that all bullish swings eventually meet consolidation. But what the future holds depends on the cornerstone of the organization.If an investment is shoddy at its core, Wall Street will eventually wise up to it. But with NVDA stock, its true upside potential has yet to be explored.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeHow Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% Returns3 Stocks to Buy to Ride the Next 3D Printing CycleThe postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Correct, But Don't Worryappeared first onInvestorPlace."

That's a good showing when compared to the S&P 500, but GOOGL stock is a long way from hitting $1,000, the holy grail of stock prices.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWord has gotten out in recent days that Google is working on a new recruitment tool that will help companies find quality recruits while managing the application and hiring process.Dubbed Google Hire, it's currently in limited testing, and could be a threat both to job boards likeLinkedInand job application tracking software such as Greenhouse and Lever.Huge Boost to AlphabetI've never understood why Google wasn'tdirectly involved in the HRbusiness given its understanding of information and its paying customers use it.Privacy concerns aside, if this product is remotely helpful in improving the hiring process for both employers and potential employees, it could be a huge boost to GOOGL stock. Here's why:Almost everyone who pays Google to advertise on its various platforms -InvestorPlacecontributor Dana Blankenhorn recently reminded readers here that Alphabet is stillgrowing ad revenues by 20%year-over-year on a quarterly basis - has some need for growing their businesses; one of the most important aspects is hiring the right people.10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeThe HR software market is said to be worth $14 billion annually in the U.S. alone. According to Aptos, Calif.-based research firm HRmarketer, companies spend $785 billion annually on employee benefits products and services, just one segment of the human resources pie.It's an industry that employs more than1.6 millionpeople in the U.S. whose job it is to manage their employer's talent.Potential Category KillerHRmarketer divides the HR marketplace into seven separate categories: Recruitment and staffing, compensation/payroll, employee benefits, talent management/employee relations, training and development, workforce planning and analytics, and legal and compliance.Google Hire is focusing on one segment of the HR marketplace, but there's no reason why it couldn't broaden its scope to cover some of these other areas.For example, if you've ever done any work with Google Analytics, you know how deep you can dive. Google has absolutely the right technology and people to compete in HR analytics. And that's just a second category.Now, I'm not saying thatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) and all the other software behemoths out there can't do the same, because they can, but Google sits in a particularly convenient position to take advantage of this marketplace, one that is still very fragmented despite its size.""Forward-looking organizations are also beginning to employ simulations and gaming to connect with talent, particularly Millennials, and analyze whether candidates are primed to succeed in a given role,""suggested Deloitte authorsMichael Stephen, David Brown and Robin Erickson in a February 28, 2017, article about talent management.Some 71% of the global business leaders surveyed for the article rate their company as weak at using gaming and simulations to attract and assess potential candidates.GOOGL Stock Would Be Less Dependent on Ad RevenueThere's no reason Alphabet can't use its $36 billion in annual cash flow to roll up businesses currently competing in the various categories of the HR marketplace.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Headed to $150 on EarningsIn December,I warned investorsthat GOOGL stock was a must-own in 2017, in part because of the revenue growth of its cloud business. Google Hire could become another tool in Alphabet's kit to generate more revenue from initiatives other than advertising which accounts for 89% of its overall sales.If you can book a flight through Google Flights or manage your communications and other business activities through Google Gmail and Google Drive, why not use Google to manage your hiring process and other HR-related activities?Soon, you'll be able to.

The breakout comes on the same day that the Chinese internet giant announced it is open sourcing its self-driving car technology.By opening up its driverless vehicle technology for automakers to use, Baidu hopes to be the default autonomous driving platform. Today's move is a direct challenge to the other major players in the self-driving car market, including AlphabetGOOGLand TeslaTSLA.Baidu has dubbed the new open-source project ""Apollo,"" and it will focus on utilizing the company's strengths in artificial intelligence to build a collaborative driverless car ecosystem.""AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles,"" said Baidu COO Qi Lu in apress release.Today's statement also included the announcement of a partnership alliance, wherein Baidu will work alongside other companies to provide the best hardware and promote participation in the project.""This will lower the barriers to entry for research and development of autonomous driving technologies, making it more accessible to the general public, and accelerate the overall pace of innovation,"" the company said.The news comes just a few weeks after Baidu CEO Robin Li addressed the possibility of spinning off its self-driving car unit into its own separate company (also read:Is Baidu Poised to Gain from Driverless Car Unit Spin Off?).""When we think business is promising enough and it has reached a stage that running it independently or introducing more strategic investors would make sense, we will do that,"" Li said.The company has been working on developing an artificial-intelligence platform that combines its own cloud platform with NVIDIA'sNVDAself-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, and others for the Chinese market.For some time, it looked like Baidu's self-driving goals would be based on domination in China-perhaps to gain footing in the ride-sharing business currently dominated by AppleAAPLbacked Didi Chuxing-but today's announcement implies that the internet behemoth has more global dreams.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today, Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Has a Secret Weapon;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome in the media have suggested that Elon Musk was right when he stated sarcastically that institutional investors upset withTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) and its corporate governance should buyFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) instead.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockRecently, I wonderedif Ford stock could ever hit $20, a share price not seen since June 2001. I argued that dividends were not the answer; share repurchases, smart R&D investments and increased debt repayments were.What I hadn't thought about were the special dividends.In early January, Forddeclared a special dividend of 5 cents to go along with the usual quarterly payout of 15 cents. That's on top of the special dividend of 25 cents paid to investors a year earlier.Over the past 16 months, Ford stock generated $1.20 in regular and special dividends for an annualized yield of 8.1%. That's awfully hard to resist in the low-yield era.Ford Stock Special DividendIn 2016, Ford had $12.8 billion in free cash flow, its highest level in the past decade. Of that, $1 billion was used for special dividends (25 cents multiplied by an average of 4 billion shares outstanding) and $2.4 billion for regular dividends, leaving lots of cash for debt repayment.10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeOver the past five years, Ford issued and repaid$207.8 billionand $158.3 billion in debt, respectively. In 2012, it added just $3.2 billion in net debt (Debt issued minus debt repaid), its best job of trimming the debt load, followed by 2016 when it added $7.2 billion in net debt.So the question for owners of F stock going forward is: Which is more preferable - Higher special dividends or increased debt repayment? Income investors would likely answer the former, but that's short-sighted in my opinion considering higher interest rates are just around the corner.Ford shareholders would benefit greatly from a leaner balance sheet. That's especially true considering that profits in 2017 are expected to be lower than this past year, with a nice rebound in 2018 off of new product introductions. That includes the Ford Bronco and higher margins due to $3 billion in cost reductions.In 2016,Ford distributed $3.5 billionto investors. In 2017, it expects that number to fall to $2.8 billion as a result of a special dividend one-fifth of the size as last year. If Ford's profits in 2017 are equivalent to those in 2014, its free cash flow should be around $7 billion dollars. That only leaves a little more than $4 billion for debt repayment, share repurchases, etc.I'm a proponent of share repurchases in this instance because F stock is so beaten up, but I believe debt repayment should take precedence. If Ford stock moves up to $15 by the fall, however, Ford management would be wise to slow its debt repayment and begin buying its stock in earnest as we move into the final quarter of the year.In 2018, it's very likely that Ford's free cash flow will be higher than $12.5 billion, leaving plenty of funds to make another 25 cent special dividend along with several billion in debt repayments and at least $1 billion in share repurchases.I'm a big fan of special dividends because you can turn the tap on and off as circumstances present themselves whereas regular dividends become something investors get accustomed to - they don't take kindly to any cuts or outright elimination of these payments.If you're an income investor, I think it's fairly safe that Ford's regular dividend of 15 cents per quarter will continue well into the future. At a yield of 5.4%, Ford stock is attractive indeed and that's without the special dividend added to the mix.The Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock Rally Is Pure FantasyThat said, I find it hard to believe that over the next five years, F stock will outperform Tesla stock - with or without the special dividend.Elon Musk might be outspoken, the brightest generally are (think Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, etc.), but he's leading the automotive industry kicking and screaming into the future and that's always worth a big-time multiple.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy Now5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsSkechers USA Inc (SKX) Stock Is a Screaming BuyThe postFord Motor Company (F) Stock Has a Secret Weaponappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ): Mergers, Buyouts and Earnings, Oh My!;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is generating a lot of noise right now. There's its impending acquisition ofYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO). There are whispers that it might try to outbidAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) in a race to ownStraight Path Communications Inc(NYSEMKT:STRP). Now, apparently, a merger withWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) orCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) is on the table.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrSo even if you're a VZ stock holder, you could be forgiven if you didn't realize that Verizon earnings for the first quarter will be reported Thursday morning.Consider this your gentle reminder.Also consider it a primer for current and would-be owners of Verizon stock. The company clearly has a lot on its plate right now, and it's going to take a very good roadmap to navigate the rest of the year.Verizon Earnings PreviewAs of the most recent look, telecom giant Verizon is expected to report first-quarter income of 97 cents per share on sales of $30.57 billion. Both are down from year-ago levels, when the company turned $32.17 billion worth of revenue into earnings of $1.06 per share.10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeThose tepid expectations are only a microcosm of the results Verizon has posted over the course of the past four quarters, when growth hit a wall against a backdrop of market saturation… in step with intense competition. That was shortly afterSprint Corp(NYSE:S) introduced its""cut your bill in half"" promotion, which was largely in response to a similarly generous offer fromT-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS).A price war ensued, taking a toll on all the combatants, including Verizon.Life hasn't been so great for Verizon stock owners of late either. Indeed, VZ is presently where it was trading in April 2013, when the4G war began in earnest.Click to EnlargeThe game simply didn't become a cutthroat one until last year, when all the key names in the business found themselves willing to sacrifice a piece of their top and bottom lines to win and keep market share.Shareholders are still struggling to decide if it has been worth it. While the dividend yield of 4.7% is solid, there's not been any capital appreciation - and increase in the price of Verizon stock - for a long, long time.3 Things to WatchIn most cases, initiatives and details matter to investors because they clearly impact the bottom line. The link between Verizon's initiatives and the company's bottom line, though, isn't quite as evident. That is to say, Verizon's results may or may not actually have to improve for the stock to start making forward progress again - the market may only need to be encouraged by the rhetoric for VZ stock to move back into a bullish mode.To that end, there are three key talking points all interested investors need to get a firm grip on before, during, and after the Verizon quarterly report on Thursday. They may or may not come up during the conference call, but they are the key drivers at this time and could help shape the post-announcement response VZ stock dishes out. In no particular order…Yahoo acquisition:It's the 800 pound gorilla in the room.Never say never, but as of the latest reports, the deal is still going through - just for $350 million less than initially offered by Verizon, to account for some missteps Yahoo made years ago. Even then, though, while the web giant managed totop last quarter's profit and revenue estimates, Yahoo just reported another year-over-year decline of both measures. Verizon clearly has some work to do to stop the bleeding.Technology plan:There are a variety of ways to connect a cell phone to a network. In addition to the traditional link to a tower using a long-range radio wave, short-range wi-fi signals can do some of that work. In some cases, the use of physical fiber-optic cables can supply part of the connection. In all cases, though, at some point Verizon (like all other carriers) will have to use FCC-licensed radio waves.That's why Verizon's failure to win any new spectrum in the most recent FCC auction was a concern for shareholders. Yet, Verizon also just inked a deal withCorning Incorporated(NYSE:GLW), agreeing to purchase at least $1.0 billion worth of fiberoptic cable from the company over the course of the coming three years.The lack of a new spectrum purchase and the investment in physical lines speaks volumes about its infrastructure plans. Verizon needs to make sure it's moving down the ideal infrastructure path though.Acquisition plan:Finally, though there's a rumor floating in the market's ether that Verizon wants to make a bid for Straight Path before AT&T seals the deal, that's only one of a large lineup of possible pairings that could prepare Verizon for the future. Ditto for the Yahoo deal.How Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% ReturnsThere's a bigger paradigm shift underway though - media and communications companies are becoming one and the same. Verizon needs to find a way to meld the two if it's going to compete with the likes of AT&T,which will soon meld withTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) to further blur the lines between media and messenger.The question is, what's Verizon's strategy to do the same? We might have an answer in the form of CEO's statements that it would be open to merging with Disney, CBS orComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA).""If (Comcast CEO Brian Roberts) came knocking on the door, I'd have a discussion with him about it,"" McAdamtold Bloomberg. ""But I'd also tell you there isn't much that I wouldn't have a discussion around if somebody came and said 'Here's a compelling reason why we ought to put the businesses together.""Bottom Line for VZ StockFor the record, Verizonmissed its prior quarter's earnings estimate… the first miss since the last quarter of 2014. It's conceivable analysts chalked it up to bad luck and didn't consider the possibility that it could happen again.On the other hand, the lowered year-over-year EPS expectation is a tacit acknowledgement that not everything is ideal.Whatever the case, it's up to Verizon to prove its value to the market here. Nobody who owns or is interested in buying VZ stock is giving the company the benefit of the doubt going into its earnings report.As of this writing, James Brumley was long T.More From InvestorPlace5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsUnited Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock Is Good ...

Profit From the Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Death Spiral;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe unending nightmare forValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) shareholders continued this week. Rather than cooking up some new horror, the company settled for one of its recurring themes: a fresh 52-week low. Indeed, VRX stock tagged $8.92 yesterday amid a high-volume, 5.9% plunge.makeArticleAd();Source:Wikimedia (Modified)The squeals of worn-out longs could be heard way up in the cheap seats. Of course, it's tough to find sympathy for these poor souls given the many warning signs and fire alarms that have gone off in the stock over the past two years.Analyzing the price action of Valeant Pharmaceuticals at this point is tantamount to surveying the aftermath of a train wreck. It's a bloody mess leaving little reason for optimism. The stock is submerged beneath every single moving average you can think of. Heaps of resistance loom overhead, making any and all rebounds incredibly suspect.Volume patterns continue to weigh heavily in favor of sellers here. Distribution days pockmark the price action like lunar craters.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixIf you're wondering if VRX stock has been down here before, the answer is yes. During the depths of the 2008 bear market, Valeant bottomed at a lowly $6.65.Perhaps that's its next stop.A Trade on VRX StockThe odds continue to favor bearish plays here. Rather than short VRX outright and run the risk of an unexpected up gap that delivers monster losses, let's consider a put play.10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeTo reduce the overall cost, and therefore risk, a long put spread should do the trick.Buy the Jul $9/$7.50 bear put spread for 65 cents or better. The max loss is limited to the 65 cent credit while the max gain is limited to the spread width minus the cost, or $1.85. If VRX stock sits above $9 at expiration, you will incur the max loss. If it falls below $7.50 you will capture the max gain.As of this writing, Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHow Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% ReturnsBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Can Still Pay You Richly7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowThe postProfit From the Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Death Spiralappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Can Still Pay You Richly;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) reported earnings on Tuesday morning that beat on both the top and bottom lines. Revenues of $22.2 billion were better than expectations for $21.6 billion, while earnings of 41 cents per share also exceeded the consensus mark of 36 cents. But BAC stock behaved … well, weirdly.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrWhile BofA initially rallied on the earnings news, that ebullience was soon dampened by the news of a big profit miss byGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS), along with a deeper drill-down into the BAC earnings. Bank of America closed down 10 cents on the day, and I expect the stock to languish over the coming weeks.And that's OK.On the surface, earnings were impressive, with a nice pop to net interest margins thanks to the Federal Reserve interest-rate hike. A closer looks highlights some concerns, however. One is the drop in loan loss reserves, which effectively is a huge piggy bank for the banks. By lowering their loss reserves, they can effectively goose up earnings.InvestorPlaceMarket StrategistAnthony Mirhaydaridelves neatly into this in his BAC article.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyAnother worry is that most of the earnings beat (outside of lower loan loss reserves) was attributable to trading revenues, especially on the fixed income side. As we know, trading revenues can be fickle. Core businesses, such as mortgage origination and lending, were less than stellar.Click to EnlargeFrom a technical perspective, BAC stock did hold the critical support level at $22.30. It also bounced nicely off the 14-day Relative Strength Index oversold reading for the second time, meaning Bank of America is still slightly positive (up 2.76%) year to date.Much of the initial euphoria that catapulted Bank of America 50% higher following Donald Trump's election victory has noticeably waned. Hopes for Dodd-Frank reform and a friendlier regulatory environment have diminished greatly, especially following the Obamacare repeal defeat. While the Federal Reserve has raised rates once this year (a positive for NIM), the likelihood for three more rate increases in 2017 is just jawboning, especially in light of slower economic growth. TheAtlanta Fedis now looking for just 0.5% expansion in Q1 GDP.So with many of the tailwinds for BAC stock now diminished, I expect BofA to chop around the $22.30 support area for the next few months.To position for a period of consolidation, a combination put sale and call spread sale makes sense.Our Trade on BAC StockSell the BAC July $22 puts at 90 cents and sell the BAC July $24/$26 call spread for 45 cents.The total credit received is $135 per combo. Ideally, Bank of America closes between $22 and $24 on July expiration to keep the $135 initial credit.How Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% ReturnsUpside risk is limited to $65 if the stock is above $24 at July expiry. If BofA is below $22, you end up long 100 shares of BAC stock for each combo sold, with a effective cost of $20.65.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

How Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% Returns;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips2017 has been a wreck forTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) bears. And get ready - because despite the company's (apparent?) flaws, TSLA stock is ready to shift gears forward once again.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs I've noted on a couple occasions in 2017, it's no secret that Tesla doesn't offer value investors a seat for passage. If it's safety and steady income you're after, you're probably better off taking CEO Elon Musk's advice and buyingFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) instead.Critics point to ever-present threats in the EV market from larger competitors such asGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andBMW. But again, to be a believer in TSLA stock isn't to be overly concerned with the limitations of reality.Bears also might warn that we should be concerned about the Trump administration's anti-anti-climate change agenda. An alternative energy/tech outfit bent on reducing our carbon footprint that looks to the government for support? Oh no!Wall Street's pros aren't too fond of TSLA stock, either. Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer have been spied firing off warning shots over the past couple months, offering up a ""Sell"" call and a ""Hold"" reaffirmation, respectively.10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeTo be a Tesla bull is to be part of a smaller crowd of believers. You have to put up with the noise.But the winds of change could soon be upon us. And if you've had the courage to be invested in TSLA stock, hey - shares are near all-time highs, so clearly, you're on the winning side.Better still: Things could just be getting started.A Quick Look at Recent Bullish DevelopmentsEarlier this year, China tech giantTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) announced a 5% stake ($1.78 billion) in Tesla. That points to the EV maker building out its brand overseas into the world's largest auto market.Tesla also recently announced a surprise deliverables beat for its Model S sedan and Model X SUV.InvestorPlace'sRichard Saintvilus discussed thesignificance of the report, and I'm in agreement - it's bullish for TSLA stock.Lastly, Tesla shares have just broken out to fresh all-time highs after more than two years of idling in a range.It's time to take Tesla out for a spin.Tesla Stock ChartClick to EnlargeAs the weekly chart of TSLA stock shows, it's been a good 2017 for investors. Shares are up more than 40% after the company corrected and consolidated since hitting its prior all-time high of $291.42 back in September 2014.After staging a breakout to fresh highs on April 3, Tesla shares have marked the past two weeks in a tighter triangular pattern - one that has continued to find support modestly above the prior resistance level.Nice!With shares up a scant 4% above the old highs, stochastics reaching oversold conditions and the weekly price contraction showing sure signs of support, it's time to think about a bullish strategy.How to Trade TSLA StockTesla's earnings are due out May 3, which gives us a little time to work with. Given the strong situation, I like a modified, targeted long bullish butterfly.Specifically, buy the May $310/$330/$340 butterfly for $4.25 (with Tesla at $300.25).Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Offers Traders a Juicy OpportunityThis is a limited-risk position that can survive even a bad earnings reaction, should that occur, without worrying too much. One contract - or the soft equivalent of 100 shares for $425 risk - compares quite nicely to buying the same amount of TSLA stock for $30,000 during an earnings event.The position begins to profit on an expiration basis above $314.25. That only requires TSLA stock to tack on less than 5% - just fractionally more than its recent high of $313.73.If Tesla were to rally strongly over the next month, the spread can expand to a max value of $20 at $330. Subtract the debit, and the trader is left with a profit of $15.75 - a return of 370% for a move of 10% in TSLA stock.Lastly, since the embedded $330/$340 bear call spread is $10 tighter than the lower $310/$330 bull call vertical, in the less likely event that Tesla sharesreallygo into overdrive, you still keep a profit of $5.75 above $340.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Why Apple Could (but Won't) Buy Disney;4/19/2017;"As one of the largest companies in the world, and with sales   of its iconic iPhone slowing,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL)  is facing speculation about how it can   continue to grow. CEO Tim Cook revealed during the January   earnings conference call that the company has made 15 to 20   acquisitions annually the past four years and that he believes   strategic value to be more important than size. He also noted   that the company had its best quarter ever for services and that   Apple's goal was to double that business over the next four   years.This outlook has led many to speculate that Apple is in the   market to make a big media acquisition to achieve that ambitious   goal. Add to that the company's record war chest of $246 billion,   and analysts can dream big.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani suggested last week   that Apple should consider buyingThe Walt Disney Company(NYSE: DIS) , noting a number of potential synergies in the   matchup. Apple would immediately gain a foothold in the content   market, based on Disney's treasure trove of intellectual   property, and could immediately become a player in video   streaming. It would also help Apple achieve its goal of doubling   services revenue, while acquiring a brand as iconic as its   own.makeArticleAd();Should Apple buy Disney? Image source: Pixabay.A stiff priceA deal like this would be predicated on a tax-repatriation   holiday. At the moment, over 90% of Apple's cash is overseas, and   the only way that will change is if there is a tax holiday, that   allows management to bring it to the U.S. without writing a huge   check to Uncle Sam. Rumors of such a deal have been coming out of   the nation's capital for some time but have yet to   materialize.Consider also that Disney has a market cap of nearly $180   billion, and any acquisition would come at a significant premium   over the company's current value. Factoring in a modest 32%   premium would result in a deal valued at $237 billion, which   would nearly deplete Apple's coffers.Daryanani isn't the first to propose an Apple/Disney marriage.   Margate Capital's Samantha Greenberg pointed out in January that   Disney is the ""last remaining publicly traded non-controlled   content/IP company."" She noted that Apple would benefit from   exclusive content and make the company more immune to product   release cycles.Other potential matchupsSeveral other high-profile potential acquisitions have been   suggested over the years. Streaming giantNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ: NFLX) has been proposed as a way for Apple to jump-start   its ambitions for growth in its services business. In 2016,   Netflix generated $8.3 billion in global streaming revenue, and   that number is only expected to grow as the company nears 100   million subscribers and continues its quest to penetrate its   nascent international markets.Electric-car makerTesla, Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a frequent recommendation among those   suggesting a massive Apple acquisition,with some even suggestingElon Musk as a replacement for Apple's Tim Cook. Rumors   concerning Apple and a potential iCar have surfaced from time to   time. Musk has confirmed that he has had conversations with   Apple, though he has declined to confirm the content of those   conversations. When Bloomberg asked if Tesla was for sale, he   replied, ""I think that's very unlikely, because we need to stay   super focused on achieving, creating a compelling mass-market   electric car.""Apple's biggest acquisition to date? Beats Music at $3     billion. Image source: Pixabay.It's a good story, but...While analysts on Wall Street like to dream big, the   likelihood that Apple will acquire Disney is small. Apple's head   of content, Eddy Cue, downplayed the idea of a megamerger at   Recode's Code Media conference in February. When asked about the   possibility of such an acquisition,he said:[T]o the extent if we wanted to do what everybody else is     doing, then you're right, we might be better off buying     somebody or doing that. But that's not what we're trying to do.     We are trying to do something that's unique, takes advantage of     our platforms, and that really brings culture to it.While Apple makes numerous acquisitions every year, its   largest to date has been Beats Music for $3 billion. That's a far   cry from the $237 billion a potential marriage with Disney might   entail. There are also many more ways for Apple to acquire   content or beef up its service revenue without emptying its war   chest. While it's true that anything is possible, that doesn't   mean every idea makes sense.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

This is Audi's Tesla-Model-S Fighter. Will it Sell?;4/18/2017;"We've known for a while thatAudi AG(NASDAQOTH: AUDVF) is planning to release along-range battery-electric SUV early next   year, the first component of its plan to directly challenge Silicon   Valley upstartTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .Today, Audi revealed a preview of the second component of that   plan. It's the sporty SUV-like vehicle you see here, and Audi   said that it plans to bring something very much like it to market   in 2019.The Audi e-tron Sportback concept is a preview of a     battery-electric Audi that will arrive at dealers in 2019.     Image source: Audi AG.makeArticleAd();What we know about Audi's latest Tesla-fighterOfficially, the Audi e-tron Sportback concept is a show car,   set to go on display at the Auto Shanghai show next week. But   Audi wasn't coy: CEO Rupert Stadler said that a production   version of the coupe-like SUV will go on sale in 2019.Audi also wasn't coy about sharing technical details. The   e-tron Sportback has a 95-kilowatt-hour battery pack powering   three electric motors, one in front and two in the rear. It's   all-wheel-drive, of course, and while it's not   Tesla-Ludicrous-mode fast, it's pretty quick for a big SUV-like   vehicle: Audi claims a zero-to-100-kilometers-per-hour   (62-miles-per-hour) time of 4.5 seconds.Another view of the Audi e-tron Sportback concept. Image     source: Audi AG.The electric Audi's construction is broadly similar to Tesla's   approach. The liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack is   positioned between the vehicle's axles, below the passenger   compartment, giving the e-tron Sportback a low center of gravity   and near-equal (52:48) weight distribution.Image source: Audi AG.Audi said the 95-kWh battery pack gives the e-tron Sportback   range ""in excess of 500 kilometers"" on the European test cycle.   That probably translates to ""in excess of 260 or so miles"" on the   stricter U.S. test (but it could be well ""in excess""). Audi   didn't give details on recharging times, except to say that the   production version will be compatible with both AC and DC   chargers that use the Combined Charging System format.The unusual design might prove popularStylistically, the e-tron Sportback combines the sportiness of   a coupe with a four-door cabin and a crossover SUV's ride height   -- an intriguing set of choices that could make it a compelling   alternative to a Tesla Model S when it arrives in 2019. (Tesla   has done a great job of updating the Model S's technology over   time, but the car's basic shape and architecture may seem dated   in a couple of years, next to the Audi.)The Audi e-tron Sportback concept's interior looks nearly     ready for production. Image source: Audi AG.Inside, it's definitely a step or two ahead of current Teslas   (no surprise, this is an Audi.) We only have photos to go on   right now, but the e-tron Sportback's interior and dash look   close to production-intent -- I see nothing that's obviously a   show-car flight of fancy.In terms of production, Audi's electric-vehicle effort is   supported by corporate parentVolkswagen's(NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) aggressive, big-budget move toward electric   vehicles. Nearly all of VW's brands are known to have long-range   electric vehicles under development. Audi's economies of scale   (via VW) could well eclipse Tesla's by early next decade.So will it sell?The production version of the Audi e-tron Sportback will   certainly draw interest when it comes to market -- if nothing   else, it's an attractive design. Whether it'll sell in large   numbers will depend on whether Audi can produce it in large   numbers, on whether it's offered at a competitive price -- and   possibly on how well Audi's first long-range electric, due next   year, is received.Audi's e-tron quattro concept, first shown in 2015, previews     the electric Audi SUV that will arrive early next year. The     production version of the e-tron Sportback will follow a year     or so later. Image source: Audi AG.It'll also depend on how well the electric Audi's technology   matches up to Tesla's: Audi's numbers are in the right ballpark,   but the details will matter. On the other hand, in Audi's favor,   it's a safe bet that its production electrics will match or beat   Tesla's Model S and Model X on interior quality and overall fit   and finish. Those may be compelling points for mainstream   luxury-vehicle buyers who like the idea of an electric, but who   may have had qualms about Teslas.We'll know more as we get closer to production. But right now,   Audi's electric-vehicle effort looks very promising.10 stocks we like better than AUDI AG VORMALS     AUDIWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Torpedoes Shares of PACCAR and Cummins;4/18/2017;"Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks,     downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do     these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today,     we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it     under the microscope...I'm afraid it's bad news for investors inPACCAR(NASDAQ: PCAR) stock today -- and owners ofCummins(NYSE: CMI) stock, too. Elon Musk is building an electric truck,   and at least one analyst thinks that could spell doomsday for   Cummins and PACCAR.The news first broke last week, whenTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEOElon Musk tweetedthat he has a ""Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September."" That   may have been a lot sooner than investors were expecting, given   that Tesla doesn't even have its Model 3 sedan on the market yet.   It certainly seems to have spooked investment banker Piper   Jaffray, which responded by downgrading shares of both PACCAR and   Cummins this morning.makeArticleAd();Here are three things you need to know about why it did   that.Image source: Cummins.1. Why PACCAR and Cummins should fear the coming   E-pocalypsePACCAR builds semis -- the enormous tractors that pull the   trailers that make up the 18-wheelers on our highways, carrying   goods to and fro. Cummins builds internal combustion engines to   power those semis. As such, Musk's intention to build an electric   truck capable of doing the same work that PACCAR's trucks do, and   with a power source that could be more efficient than Cummins'   and that will certainly look ""greener"" to environmentalists,   poses a direct threat to the business models of both PACCAR and   Cummins.2. Tesla threatens PACCARPiper Jaffray makes no bones about this. In a downgrade   reported this morning onStreetInsider.com, the analyst warns that Tesla's new ""Class 8"" electric truck   will have a ""potential disruptive impact"" on PACCAR.That makes sense. Even if Musk only unveils a model truck in   September, and does not actually begin offering one for sale,   PACCAR could see an impact on its own sales and profits, as truck   companies hedge their bets and potentially put off purchases of   old-tech trucks in order to be able to spend that money on   battery-powered Tesla semis later.This could be the reason Piper is cutting $0.02 from its   earnings projection for PACCAR this year, and $0.07 more next   year, ratcheting back estimates to $3.74 in 2017, and $4.43 in   2018. It's also downgrading PACCAR stock to neutral and cutting   its price target by 8%, to $66.3. Why Cummins should worry, tooThe news is no better for Cummins. AsTheFly.comwrites, Piper is worried that ""companies like Tesla are aiming to   supplant [Cummins'] products."" And while intention isn't   accomplishment, Piper believes the risk is real enough to begin   taking chips off the table.After all, Cummins shares are up 25% over the past 52 weeks,   versus only a 15% gain for PACCAR stock. Piper Jaffray believes   that ""Cummins' multiple has expanded to a fair level,"" and   there's little left to be gained by buying the stock -- and   perhaps a lot to be lost if Tesla succeeds in supplanting   Cummins' internal combustion engines as the standard for powering   semis.Curiously, at the same time as Piper is downgrading Cummins   stock to neutral, and cutting its price target by 10% (to $144   per share), the analyst is raising its estimates for the   company's earnings both this year (to $8.14) and next ($9.59).   These are strange moves in a downgrade, but perhaps Piper sees   the risk from Tesla as farther out, and not so immediate as the   risk posed to PACCAR.Bonus thing: Keep your eye on the profits ballThe one thing Piper doesn't spend a lot of time on in making   either of these downgrades is pointing out that while Tesla may   pose a threat to PACCAR and Cummins, that doesn't necessarily   makeTesla stocka better investment thaneitherof them.Remember: Even if Piper is cutting profits estimates for   PACCAR and Cummins this year, it still expects both companies to   be firmly profitable this year, and next year as well. In   contrast, Tesla --which Piper Jaffray likes-- is not expected to earn any kind of profit either this year or   next, and may only earn as little as $0.20 per share in 2019.So even if I agree in general with Piper's assessment that   Cummins stock costs too much at 18 times earnings, and that   PACCAR costsmuchtoo much at 44 times trailing earnings (and I do agree), that   doesn't necessarily make Tesla a buy at infinity-times-negative   earnings. Small consolation to Cummins and PACCAR investors, I   know -- but the numbers don't lie.Even if Cummins and PACCAR stocks are not buys, I don't   believe that Tesla stock is, either.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's How Apple Can Reach a $1 Trillion Valuation;4/18/2017;"""I sold my stock in Apple back in 1995. If I would have held it longer, I would have been a millionaire!,"" exclaims that one guy that we all totally know.While that guy tends to talk about ""what could have been"" a little too frequently to be taken seriously, he does have a point here. After decades of consistent growth, interrupted by just a few down periods, AppleAAPLis the world's most-valuable publicly-traded company with a market capitalization of nearly $750 million.Perhaps no company has burned its imagery into the minds of the public better than this technology behemoth.

Its logo is iconic; its products are timeless.And investors still want more.So how can Apple, with its well-established product lines and billions of existing customers, break into uncharted territory? How does the one on top climb higher? How does the biggest get even bigger?The short answer: by trying something new.Old Dog, New TricksOut of the many new options that Apple has to test out, it seems like the company is taking self-driving cars the most seriously. Last Friday, the iPhone maker received a permit to begin testing self-driving cars in California, and it looks like Apple's formerly top-secret autonomous vehicle project is finally ready to take the next step (also read:Apple Gets Self-Driving Car Permit: What's at Stake for the Industry?).However, we are still-at the very least-several years away from an ""iCar,"" and Apple is likely to meet stiff competition from its industry competitors in this field.On top of the big-name automakers like TeslaTSLA, General MotorsGM, FordF, and many others working on self-driving cars, tech companies like Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand IntelINTCare also working on their own autonomous vehicle projects (also read:Intel Buys Mobileye: Are More Driverless Car Deals in the Future?).The self-driving car space is sure to be crowded, but a brand like Apple won't have to worry about name recognition, and if the company's previous products are any evidence, Apple's car project will likely result in a sleek, user-friendly, and high-performing vehicle.Becoming a major player in what could be a world-changing industry, especially one that is still at its infancy like this one, would certainly help Apple gain even more value. Of course, that's far from the only thing the Tim Cook-led company can do to bring its market cap over $1 trillion.If the internet-and its vast array of unfounded rumors-were left to decide how Apple can grow, it would want the tech giant to enter the world of media production… by buying DisneyDIS.Yes, the age-old ""Apple should buy Disney"" conjecture is alive and well, despite no real evidence pointing towards any merger talks between the two companies.And while it may be pure fiction, an Apple-Disney merger does speak to something that is currently missing from Apple's portfolio of products and projects. For all of the snazzy devices that the company makes, it owns very little of what its customers access on those devices.Sure, Apple Music has growninsanely fast, but Apple has notably not yet entered the world of video streaming or original programming. The Apple TV device is a strong candidate for any cord-cutter, and an Apple-owned over-the-top streaming service has been rumored for years, but buying a media company would immediately bolster Apple's arsenal if it does want to seriously contend in this space at some point.Bottom LineThe goal of a publicly-traded company is not to reach new market-cap milestones, break records, or make headlines. In fact, it is quite a bit simpler than that. All public companies, big or small, need to provide value to their shareholders.This means that reaching a $1 trillion valuation is likely not an explicit goal for Apple right now. Instead, Tim Cook and company are probably plotting on how to effectively deliver the next must-have product, while also continuing to pump out the Apple products we all know and love.These goals are, of course, intended to help the company grow and provide that desired value for its shareholders.But an Apple that's worth $1 trillion is not that far away, and the company has several obvious new routes it can take if it wants to add the nearly $250 million in market cap needed to reach the milestone.Only time will reveal how Apple intends on continuing its ridiculous growth, but in the meantime, we can continue to speculate. Will Apple become a self-driving car giant, or will it purchase a media company and take the entertainment business by storm? I can't wait to find out.Sell These Stocks.

3 Reasons That Tesla (TSLA) Will Be the Most Valuable Automaker Again;4/18/2017;"Last week, Tesla Inc.TSLAbrieflybecame America's most valuable car company by market cap. While General Motors (GM) regained its throne shortly after, the Silicon Valley-based automaker is not looking to back down from the fight.Here's why Tesla is going to be the country's most valuable car company again:Price IncentivesElectrekreported that Tesla hasdiscontinuedthe cheapest version of its Model S sedan and lowered the price of the following variant the 75 kWh Model S, by $7,500 to $69,500.The price slashes ""makes sense,"" according toThe Motley Fool.As Tesla's Model 3, the cost-efficient electric car, is set to launch in July, it could compete in sales with the Model S. By lowering the price, the owners who prefer an upgrade or a more spacious car might have a greater incentive to purchase a Model S.ChinaThe price drop is not only good for electric car buyers here in America but also to customers in Asia. As many countries in Asia continue to shift their focus to greener policies, citizens and corporations are looking at the electric car for alternative transportation to avoid air pollution.Not only is China theworld's largest auto market, with 23.6 million cars sold in 2016, it is also thelargest market for electric cars. According toEv-Volumes, China saw 85% growth in electric car sales from 2015 to 2016.China has demonstrated its commitment to reducing CO2 emissions and building a market for electric vehicles. The country looks to create a $1.3 billion market, as it announced in February that Beijing's taxi fleet of 70,000 vehicles will be switched over to an all-electric fleet, according to a report byNational Business Daily.Before shaking up the taxi fleet, Chinese citizens have been buying electric cars. Tesla reported that its sales in China tripled in 2016 compared to 2015, bringing in over $1 billion in revenues.Self-Driving CarsAlphabet'sGOOGLGoogle or Uber aren't the only tech companies building an autonomous car.China's tech giant, TencentTCEHYis also one of the leaders in developing self-driving car technology.Reutersreported back in July 2016 that Tencent backed a Chinese automotive venture, Future Mobility, which aims to launch an electric self-driving car before 2020.Furthermore, Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO,pledgedto make a car that can drive from Los Angeles to New York City with no human control by the end of 2017. Teslareleased a videoof its Model X SUV driving itself around Palo Alto last year.Though it is plausible that Musk will not meet his own deadline, Tencent seems to have faith.  The Chinese Internet leader recently purchased $1.8 billion worth of Tesla shares.These investments by Tencent not only show the company's belief in the market for the self-driving car, but it also hints at Tesla's possible foothold in the Chinese auto market. With market cap of over $280 billion, Tencent offers more than just financial backing, but also strong political connections.Bottom LineTesla's recent decision to lower prices might just be a short-term strategy to keep investors confident while it works to explore China's market and develop a self-driving car. Either way, these choices are smart. It's clear that Tesla still has several key markets to break into, and that means it will surely regain the top spot eventually.makeArticleAd();Sell These Stocks.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Isn’t Sexy, It’s Relevant;4/18/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWithin the jungle of popular consumer technology companies,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is too oftenlost in the shuffle. This is a point that InvestorPlace contributor Richard Saintvilus hits square on the head. When you have smart device overlordApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) dominating the cultural lexicon, it's hard to justify buying Microsoft stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn top of that pressure point, you have sector outperformers likeTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). Year-to-date, Tesla shares are up an astounding 44%.Outside of their broader technology categorization, Microsoft and Tesla are largely two different species. But consider general market psychology and the emotions of the moment: Why go after Microsoft stock for its steady fundamentals when you can chase the sexy stock of the year?Plenty of Fresh Opportunities for Microsoft stockTo address the challenges of its industry, the tech stalwart became acquisitive. Thanks to its shopping spree, Microsoft ended up with some marquee brands. But more than just an emotionally-driven purchase, investors can appreciate the intellect behind the acquisitions.The$8.5 billion dealfor Skype is a prime example. Over the past ten years, enormous changes occurred in consumer technologies. One of those changes is in long-distance communication. The days of international calling cards and paying for PIN codes, while not dead, are certainly waning. Skype, with more than74 million users, has a lot to do with that.5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsNaturally, ownership of the Skype brand gives MSFT a boost in terms of marketing exposure. At the same time, management is heavily investing in its functionality. The latest Skype version has a redesignedgroup videocalling format, which better facilitates multiple participants. Such features incentivize non-Skype users to jump onboard, and thereby, promotes revenue-making opportunities for Microsoft stock.Considering that 40% of Skype calls are of the video-to-video variety, MSFT is doing its homework. And that played into their much-publicized (and much-criticized) takeover of LinkedIn. It's not just for the fact that LinkedIn is the""world's largest professional network,""but the idea that nobody job hunts in the old ""pick up the phone and hustle"" way. Just like Skype, LinkedIn is an opportunity for MSFT stock to leverage paradigm-shifting transitions with an industry.Finally, as is mentioned by all of Wall Street, Microsoft stock is rapidly becoming a cloud computing investment. Azure, the company's venture into the cloud, is behind onlyAmazon.com, Inc's(NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services. Furthermore, it's gaining increasing adoption among the top U.S. businesses. One only needs to reference the gargantuan revenue growth to see how important Azure is to MSFT stock.Don't Overlook the CoreAll of these are great bullish arguments. However, I still love Microsoft stock for its core, PC-based business.On the surface, that seems like an oddball statement. Anyone that's anyone knows that the PC market is essentially dead on arrival. To survive in consumer retail, a tech company has to introduce smart devices such as tablets. To some extent, I agree with the public sentiment, and so too does MSFT.I just prefer its methods over its competitors.For example, when Apple released its iPad,Sony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) was quick to follow up with a copycat product. In contrast, Microsoft went with a hybrid option for their Surface, which integrates the best of the tablet and PC worlds.Although it may take some time for the consumer base to concede, the Surface is vastly superior to the iPad. Have you ever tried doing anything of significance other than web-browsing with an iPad? Particularly when it comes to spreadsheets, the tablet platform is inherently a disaster. What would take minutes on a tablet can be squared away in seconds with a keyboard and mouse via the Surface.Should You Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock or General Motors Company (GM)?And when you're talking about PCs, nobody comes close to Microsoft. The company has off-the-charts household penetration rates. Their Office programs are the gold standard for personal, educational and professional use.True, knowledge of other applications is advantageous. However, not knowing Microsoft programs is an instant death sentence, which is why Microsoft stock has a bright future even without its extracurricular bonuses.Nobody says that about Apple products, as brilliant as they are. They're quirky, they're fun, but they're also limited. Honestly, MSFT stock is likely to be more relevant in a hundred years. And that's why you can't go wrong going long.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE stock.More From InvestorPlace7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy Now10 Spring Cleaning Tips for Your Portfolio7 Energy Stocks That Will Turn 2017 on Its HeadThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Isn't Sexy, It's Relevantappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Still Has Some Pop Left;4/18/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) has been hitting some turbulence lately. That's largely thanks to Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari, who threw cold water on shares with a ""sell"" rating on AMD stock.makeArticleAd();Source: AMDInvestors took note, scattering to send shares down by 6%. No surprise - Advanced Micro is hyper-sensitive, especially considering how many investors are sitting on triple-digit gains.Why take the risk?Hari offered up several reasons for his bearishness on AMD stock. One is that the valuation appears to be out of sync with the underlying fundamentals; Hari thinks that a fair value is $11. It's not a crazy argument, as Advanced Micro has spiked from less than $2 in March 2015 to the $13 area and now trades at 43 times forward earnings estimates. By comparison,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is at 28X andBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) sports a 14 multiple.But perhaps Hari's other concern is much more serious: the threat of competition. While AMD's run has come amid improved fundamentals based on increasingly superior products, NVDA andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) are no slouches. These tech operators not only have enormous resources but dominant positions in their market categories. What's more, they may be willing to engage AMD in price wars if they must.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Officially Off the Investment PedestalHari's not the only skeptical analyst out there, as the consensus price target sits at $12.20, below current prices.AMD Stock and MomentumWhile the bears have good arguments, I think they miss the point.Advanced Micro Devices is at a major inflection point, which has attracted numerous momentum traders that couldn't care less about valuation. They see a strong growth path and exciting developments, and that's enough for them.AMD should continue to deliver on this front.CEO Lisa Su has crafted a great strategy including several years of disciplined R&D efforts. For example, there is the Ryzen 7 CPU, which has garnered standout reviews. The technology is poised to snag a lucrative share of the massive gaming cateogry. There is also the Vega GPU, which is gunning for Nvidia, as well as Naples, a chipset that should give INTC a run for its money in the datacenter market.AMD has already been gaining traction with customer demand. Some of the marquee names includeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) andAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA), which hosts 35% of the websites in China.AMD also has a platform that is based on outsourcing manufacturing tothird parties, such as Global Foundries andTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM). This allows for much more focus on innovation and product development - but also means that the company can quickly scale production according to customer needs.In the meantime, Su is continuing to invest in longer-term opportunities like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the internet of things. For example, last week, Su announced a deal to buy startupNitero, a leader in millimeter wave technologies that allow for wireless VR and AR headsets. Keep in mind that current systems on the market - fromHTC,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) - require unwieldy chords.5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsIf anything, this has likely been a problem with customer adoption.Bottom LineThis isn't to imply that AMD stock will post triple-digit returns again last year. That's a stretch.But Advanced Microisin the midst of a transformative upswing, driven by multiple product launches in red-hot markets. Considering that, it seems like a good bet that AMD should continue to outperform the broader market.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookas well asOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools & services for employee stock options of pre/post IPO companies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Should You Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock or General Motors Company (GM)?;4/18/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this month,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) briefly surpassedGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) as the largest U.S. automaker based on market capitalization, causing many to question whether to add TSLA stock to their portfolios.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSo far this year, TSLA stock has gained a whopping 40% and its market cap rose as high as $51 billion. By comparison, GM stock is down roughly 4% on the year with a market cap that's neck and neck with Tesla stock.The fact that investors are flocking to Elon Musk & Co. over a tried-and-true GM stock speaks volumes about the confidence Wall Street has in Tesla's future.Because Tesla has only been able to produce a profit twice since going public, TSLA stock's current valuation reflects its future potential. Even TSLA CEO Elon Musk admitted the stock was""absurdly overvalued""based on past performance, but said the price instead reflects the future cash flow Tesla shareholders can expect.So where does that leave GM? Has the car company been overtaken or is the Tesla rally irrational exuberance? My guess is that it's a little bit of both.TSLA Stock vs. GM StockSure, Tesla stock overtook GM in terms of market cap earlier this month, but GM is still head and shoulders in front of TSLA in terms of financial performance. Tesla sells just a fraction of the number of vehicles sold by General Motors each year, and GM reported profits upward of $9 billion in 2016. Tesla? A $675 millionloss.Comparing the two companies in terms of investment potential is difficult. They are in two very different categories! While GM is an established value brand that plays by investors' rules, Tesla is a cash-burning upstart that trades solely on future potential.As an investor, the way a company makes and uses its money is an important metric to consider, and GM clearly wins in this category.Despite worries that the U.S. auto market has reached its peak, GM's management is projecting per-share earnings of more than $6 this year and the firm is undergoing several operational changes to further improve its profitability.GM isdropping it's less profitable European business, which is expected to save the firm around $1 billion. Not only that, but General Motors is shifting its production so that all of its vehicles can be produced using just four platforms. Such a move would cut down on costs dramatically and improve manufacturing time and efficiency.Tesla has been touted as arguably the most innovative automaker in the U.S. because of the firm's autonomous driving efforts and its success in making luxury electric vehicles.However, just because TSLA was first in the electric car market doesn't mean it will remain at the top of the pack. Competitors like GM andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) have their own fleet of electric cars that are continually being improved.Not only that, but GM has been working on its own autonomous driving technology and the firm's substantially larger budget and experience in the auto industry makes it one of the best contenders in the industry.Astudy by Navigate Researchnamed GM as having the most potential in the self-driving space of all 18 companies evaluated. Tesla, on the other hand, came in toward the bottom half of the pack.Bottom Line on TSLA and GMThat's not to say that buying TSLA shares is a bad idea. The company boasts something that no other U.S. automobile maker has - youth. Tesla is just starting to iron out the details of its operations and has been ramping up production.TSLA is a growth stock, something that GM can't ever claim because the company's established business doesn't have as much room for expansion as TSLA's does.Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is a Screaming Buy After Q1 EarningsNot only that, but even though TSLA's core business is electric vehicles, the company is more than just an automaker - TSLA is also a tech firm and an energy company, two spaces that are likely to see a great deal of growth in the years to come.GM stock offers investors security and consistency while TSLA is likely to bring volatility to your portfolio. For long-term investors with a stomach for risk, TSLA stock is a good bet. For investors looking for solid companies with sound financials, however, GM is the better pick.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowTrade Micron Technology, Inc.

Apple Eyes Autonomous Car Market, Gets Permit for Test Drive;4/17/2017;"As per the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMW) in the state of California,Apple IncAAPLhas secured a permit to test self-driving vehicles. The permit is for test driving three vehicles (2015 Lexus RX450h models) with two drivers each, adds DMW.For long, there has been tremendous speculation about Apple's autonomous car technology development efforts, which is apparently codenamed, Project Titan. As usual, Apple has refrained from commenting on the matter so far. Apple loves to maintain secrecy regarding projects it's working on. Per media reports, on being asked about the permit, the company pointed to the Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner's letter to NHTSA, written in November last year. In the letter, Kenner said ""The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.""Self Driving Car Race Heats UpSelf driving technology has gained immense importance in the past few years with tech and auto behemoths like Apple, AlphabetGOOGL, FordF, Tesla IncTSLA, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Uber and Lyft directing resources to develop this technology.Apple Inc.

Tesla Product Pricing Volatility Is a Headache for Consumers;4/17/2017;"Compared to larger automakers,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) changes its product pricing relatively more   frequently. We're not just talking about international pricing,   where adjustments are often needed to compensate for foreign   exchange rate fluctuations; U.S. pricing is often a moving   target. That presents some unique challenges for customers that   don't know if or when a price change may be imminent, or if   they're better off buying before or after such a change.That can potentially be a headache for consumers.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();""Fair?""Over the weekend, Tesla updated its design studio to reflect   the previously announced discontinuation of the Model S 60 and   60D, which Tesla said would be available until April 16, 2017.   The Model S lineup now starts with 75 kWh battery packs and up,   similar to Model X, which saw its software-limited 60 kWh version   discontinued last year after just a few months of   availability.As mentioned last month, if there had beenno other pricing changes, the entry-level Model S base price would have jumped from   $68,000 to $74,500. That assumption very well may have led a   number of customers to order the 60 or 60D ahead of the   discontinuation, believing that a meaningful price increase was   coming.@elonmusk@pkingdesignNew S60 owner for 2 months, now S75 = S60 price + more features   (liftgate/roof), yet I have to pay $2000 for 60->75Kwh   upgrade? Fair?- Ramki (@Wertyu8088)April 17, 2017Here's the thing: Tesla tweaked its Model S 75 and 75D pricing   and the new configurations offer even better value. A   single-motor 75 now starts at $69,500 -- just $1,500 more than a   single-motor 60 used to cost -- while adding the new all-glass   roof and power liftgate as standard features. The glass roof   option used to cost $1,500 and the power liftgate used to only be   included as part of the $3,500 premium upgrades package. Tesla   also reduced the price to upgrade any software-limited 60 kWh   packs to 75 kWh capacity to better reflect the new pricing.Last weekend's adjustment is just the latest in recent years.   In 2015, Tesla dropped the 60 kWh ($70,000) Model S for the first   time and moved to 70 kWh ($75,000) versions. There was a $1,500   price hike in early 2016 associated with the Model S facelift,   before Tesla reintroduced the software-limited 60 kWh a few   months later at $66,000. That price was bumped up by $2,000 in   November with no explanation to start at $68,000.Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment,   but provided the following statement toElectrekregarding the recent price changes:Periodically we have adjusted pricing and available options     to best reflect the value of our products and our customers'     preferences. Today's updates include slight price decreases to     our 75, 75D and 90D models to account for the discontinuation     of our 60 kWh models, and next week we will be implementing     slight price increases to our higher end 100D and P100D models.     We expect our total average selling price to remain almost     exactly the same.Price increases for our 100D and P100D models will take     effect on April 24, 2017 to best accommodate customers already     in the order process, while price decreases for 75, 75D and 90D     models will take effect today.It's still better than dealing with dealersThese changes may be frustrating for consumers to navigate,   but it's still probably better than the alternative dealer model,   where consumers face even more volatile pricing just based on   what dealer they go to. Dealers are encumbered by an increasingly   convoluted system of manufacturer incentives that can quite   literally make or break the dealer's bottom line, according toAutomotive News. These programs indirectly but inevitably affect the price that   consumers have to pay.Automotive Newsalso previously reported on pricing volatility forGM's new Chevy Bolt as dealers test different price points to gauge   demand at the local level.In other words, most car purchases lack price transparency and   suffer from volatility purely as a function of the dealer model,   while Tesla offers transparent pricing through direct sales   although it creates its own pricing volatility, for better or for   worse.

Has Honda Already Fallen Behind General Motors on Electric-Car Technology?;4/17/2017;"Honda Motor Company(NYSE: HMC) finally offered investors some, er,clarityaround its green-car strategy. In a presentation in New York last   week, Honda showed off all three variants of its Clarity sedan --   powered by plug-in hybrid, fuel cell, and battery electric   drivetrains.But the details left a lot of analysts wondering exactly what   Honda is thinking with these products -- and whether Honda is   already falling behind in the emerging race to bring electric   cars to the mass market.The 3 Honda Clarity models at Honda's New York event. From     the left: Clarity Electric, Clarity Plug-in Hybrid, and Clarity     Fuel Cell. Image source: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.makeArticleAd();What Honda said about its new Clarity green-car modelsAt a press event at the New York International Auto Show,   Honda officially unveiled the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid and Clarity   Electric sedans. The two Claritys join a third, theHonda Clarity Fuel Cell, which went on sale in parts of California late last year.All three Clarity variants share the same basic shape and   features. They're four-door sedans about the size (inside and   out) of Honda's popular and roomy Accord sedan. Like the Accord,   the Clarity triplets look good inside, with crisp styling,   comfortable seats, and sensibly laid-out controls.As with the other Clarity models, the interior of the     Clarity Electric is typical of Honda. That's a good thing.     Image source: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.But unlike the handsome-if-generic Accord, the Claritys'   exterior styling is best described as...quirky. Honda said the   Claritys' lines were optimized for low aerodynamic resistance,   but they also seem to have been calculated to make the 3 Clarity   models stand out from more mainstream vehicles.The Clarity Plug-in Hybrid combines a 1.5 liter gasoline   four-cylinder with a 181-horsepower electric motor and a 17   kilowatt-hour battery pack. Honda expects it to earn an EPA   miles-per-gallon-equivalent rating of 105, with a respectable   electric-only driving range of 42 miles.The Clarity Electric has a 161-horsepower electric motor   powered by a 25.5 kilowatt-hour battery pack. Honda says it can   be fully recharged in just over three hours with a 240-volt   charger, and it can get to 80% charge in 30 minutes with a DC   Fast charger.The Clarity Electric will launch in select U.S. markets later   this year, while the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid will launch in 2018.   Honda is targeting sales of 75,000 Claritys (of all types) in the   U.S. over the next four years.What is Honda thinking with the Clarity Electric's tiny   range?The biggest question on everyone's minds had to do with the   Clarity Electric and its tiny 25.5 kilowatt-hour battery pack,   which is expected to earn an EPA range rating of just 80   miles. That's a very short range for a car with a price tag   that's expected to be around $35,000.The bar for mass-market electric vehicles was raised a long   way last year with the debut ofGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt EV. The Bolt offers an EPA-rated range   of 238 miles -- for about the same price Honda is expected to ask   for its Clarity Electric.The Clarity Electric is expected to have a range of just 80     miles. Image source: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.Honda executives in New York argued that the Clarity Electric   should have a somewhat higher price because it's a larger   vehicle. The Bolt is a small crossover, while the Clarity   Electric is a midsize sedan. But that's weak sauce: Plain and   simple, Honda's electric car is coming out of the gate a couple   of big steps behind the competition. (Just wait untilTeslalaunches its Model 3.)Frankly, the Clarity Electric's range is an embarrassment for   Honda. It suggests that the proud Japanese automaker has fallen   behind on this important emerging technology.Will the new Honda Clarity models sell?Honda's goal of 75,000 sales over four years for all Clarity   models combined is pretty modest. It should be able to make that   number on the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid alone. At least on paper,   the Plug-in Hybrid is a competitive offering -- though its   toughest competition may turn out to be another Honda, the Accord   Hybrid.I certainly don't see the Clarity Electric or Clarity Fuel   Cell generating more than a handful of sales over the next four   years -- at least, not without some big price cuts, a range   upgrade for the Electric, or both.10 stocks we like better than Honda MotorWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Sentenced to Purgatory After Q1 Earnings;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe first-quarter earnings report fromNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) had the opportunity to provide an interesting peek into the market's sentiment toward NFLX stock, and we got it. But it wasn't at all what investors might expect.makeArticleAd();Source:Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)First-quarter profits beat the consensus, with earnings of 40 cents per share topping estimates by 3 cents. However, subscriber growth disappointed relative to even Netflix's seemingly cautious guidance. Q2 guidance came in above expectations, though, which fits the narrative coming from Netflix itself.Guidance given in January after Netflix's Q4 results set the table for a slightly different view. The company projected lower subscriber growth in Q1, due to a tough comparison (including Netflix's global launch the year before) and a back-loaded content slate.But Netflix also guided for improved subscriber growth over the rest of the year, thanks to a stronger content slate. And it forecast a sharp jump in operating margins to about 9% for Q1, and 7% for the full year as some of those content and marketing costs kicked in.In other words, Netflix seemed to set up 2017 as the first step in Netflix stock moving away from being a pure growth play - one in which investor attention focused solely on subscriber numbers. Bears on NFLX stock often have derided the fact that Netflix earnings ""don't matter."" Yet the company itself seems intent on countering that narrative, including an aim detailed in the Q4 shareholder letter to ""balance growth and profitability.""From that standpoint, the Q1 Netflix earnings report seems likely to do little to settle the argument between the bears and the bulls.Netflix Earnings Were Good EnoughNetflix stock is down modestly in after-hours trading, but I'd expect a reversal. There's enough in the Q1 report to keep NFLX stock elevated - at least for now.5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsIn its first-quarter shareholder letter, Netflix doubled down on its 2017 narrative, telling readers that ""starting this year, we can be primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics."" Perhaps not coincidentally, Netflix earnings look strong on both fronts.Revenue increased 34.7% year-over-year in Q1, pretty much matching Street estimates. Guidance for a 31% jump in Q2 appears ahead of expectations as well. Subscriber growth did narrowly miss guidance. But Netflix is projecting 3.2 million net additions in Q2 - nearly double the year-prior total. The argument heading into the quarter - that better content would drive more growth after Q1 - seems to hold.Meanwhile, operating margin for Q1 came in at a handsome 9.7%. There, too, Netflix is sticking to its story, with Q2 EBIT margin guided down to 4.4%, with much of the difference coming from the shift of the new season ofHouse of Cardsinto Q2.Netflix stock neared an all-time high heading into the report, and is down a bit under 2% in early after-hours trading. There could be some weakness in NFLX stock on Tuesday, if only because of what a 3%+ gain on Monday priced in.That said, Netflix bears expecting a post-earnings collapse should be disappointed.Netflix Stock Might Not Be Good EnoughAt the same time, it's hard to argue that Q1 was a blowout quarter, particularly in terms of growth. Cash flow remains a concern. Netflix earnings were positive, but free cash flow wasnegative$423 million. The company guided post-Q1 for cash burn of roughly $2 billion in 2017.Competition is an issue too - one Netflix addressed directly in its shareholder letter. It said followingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) into live sports was not a ""strategy that we think is smart for us."" (Amazoninked a dealto air Thursday night football last week.) Netflix wrote that so-called VMVPDs like Sling TV,HuluandAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube weren't a competitive threat, as Netflix is a ""largely complementary"" service.In other words, it'sComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) andCharter Communications, Inc.(NASDAQ:CHTR) that should be worried, not NFLX stock holders.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Isn't What Goldman ThinksMany bears would disagree, however, and would point to the cash burn as what is required from Netflix simply to maintain slowly moderating subscriber growth. Although  Q1 fits Netflix's narrative, it's not going to dissuade those bears.With Netflix stock just off an all-time high set last month, and NFLX shares now valued at over $60 billion, anything less than a blowout likely is priced in.Where NFLX Stock Goes From HereAll told, Q1 seems likely to extend the bull/bear argument over Netflix, not solve it.Bulls can point to growth and margin expansion; bears can highlight cash burn and valuation. Coming out of Q1, both sides are right, at least in part. And that means the argument over NFLX stock moves onto the Q2 report, just three short months away.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceShould You Buy Tesla, Inc.

Apple Gets Self-Driving Car Permit: What's at Stake for the Industry?;4/17/2017;"Last Friday, it was reported that iPhone makerApple Inc.AAPLreceived a permit to begin testing self-driving vehicles in California, signaling that the tech giant could be ready to design or build autonomous vehicle technology, as well as bring its secret ""Project Titan"" out from the dark.According to the state's Department of Motor Vehicleswebsite, the permit allows Apple to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h luxury hybrid sport utility vehicles; the company will also have six drivers permitted to operate the vehicles.Project Titan, Apple's very secretive self-driving car effort, has been in development for several years now, though the firm has never formally acknowledged it. Recently, the whole thingappeared to be in flux, with Apple reportedly deciding to focus on self-driving software instead of fully autonomous cars.Late last year, Apple submitted a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying it ""uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation."" Many took this at the time as Apple's strongest hint that the company was still developing self-driving technology.However, Apple joins a seriously crowded space. You already have big players like TeslaTSLA, Alphabet'sGOOGLWaymo, Uber, and NvidiaNVDAtesting their autonomous car technology in California, in addition to traditional automakers like Ford MotorsF, General MotorsGM, Volkswagen'sVLKAYAudi unit, and VolvoVLVLYracing to get a self-driving car model on the road.Because Project Titan is still being kept under wraps, it's hard to say how behind or ahead Apple is compared to its new competitors in the self-driving car industry. A company sourcereportedly told Bloombergthat autonomous vehicle testing would begin ""soon,"" but I think it's safe to say that when an Apple prototype finally hits the road, the entire industry will surely be in for a shakeup.Apple redefined how consumers think of a computer, a portable music player, a smartphone, a tablet, and even a watch, so it's not that improbable to think that they will be the company to help redefine how Americans think of a car, and what it means to drive one.The Best & Worst of ZacksmakeArticleAd();Today you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Under Armour Inc (UAA) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) Should Join Forces;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA) has finally reaped the rewards from years of misspending. The company has dug itself a big hold that will be difficult to recover from, and UAA stock holders are paying a big price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockUAA shares have fallen 60% over the past year, and that's not just a sentiment-and-momentum play. The fundamentals are backing up this sob story - margins are cratering due to a price war withNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) andAdidas AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:ADDYY) that's clearly not winnable.Under Armour is in desperate need of reinforcements.Lululemon Athletica Inc.(NASDAQ:LULU) could do the trick.The Under Armour Growth Story Is BrokenIn March,I discussed the growth story at Under Armourand how Jefferies analyst Randal Konik believes it's still intact. Personally, I find that argument hard to swallow when you consider that Under Armour's 21.8% revenue increase in 2016 translated to just $9 million in additional operating profit.Nike, a far more mature company, did a much better job converting revenues to profits in the past year providing plenty of ammunition, in my opinion, that Under Armour's growth story is in fact broken.7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowA month earlier, I suggested thatUnder Armour CEO and founder Kevin Plank remove himself as chief executivebefore he does irreparable harm to his company and UAA stock. Nothing that has happened since has changed my mind. It's too personal for Plank; he's not going to be able to do the things that need to be done to turn the ship in the right direction. At least, not quickly.Phil Knight had the right idea when he and the board chose to bring in an outsider to run Nike; they just hired the wrong guy. It happens. But at least NKE tried to shake things up.Bringing in a new CFO is not the solution.Time to Circle the WagonsI thoughtVF Corp(NYSE:VFC) would bethe company to make a playfor Lululemon, but it has had its owntroublesto deal with, and that has kept the apparel conglomerate relatively quiet on the M&A front. That could change at any time, so the fact Under Armour is in its weakest position since its founding in 1997 makes this an opportune time for LULU to consider a deal.Under Armour and Lululemon ought to come together to fight Nike and Adidas. Both firms currently face serious challenges as they cope with growth. Together, they would make a formidable team.LULU founder Chip Wilson floated the idea back in February when he rented a Vancouver bus shelter outside the company's headquarters that stated:""Lululemon, Buy Under Armour Now!""""Lululemon's way more profitable,"" Wilson told CNBC while talking about the reasons for placing the bus shelter ad. ""It's super weak right now. (I) wouldn't want to be working at Under Armour right now.""The irony of that statement is that LULU stock took a tumble March 30,falling more than 20% on weak Q1 2017 guidance.One week before announcing its fourth-quarter earnings, InvestorPlace contributor Laura Hoy made a whole bunch of argumentswhy a Lululemon/Under Armour tie-up made no sense. While I respect her opinion, I think she has it wrong for a couple of reasons. Her valuation concerns make sense, but she's forgetting several attributes of both businesses that had Wilson broaching the subject in the first place.5 Reasons Why Lululemon and Under Armour Should CombineHere's a quick-hit list of reasons why a merger would make sense right now:Lululemon has higher gross margins than Under Armour; LULU's are getting stronger, UAA's are getting weaker.LULU is generating free cash flow, Under Armour is not.Lululemon is overweighted to a female customer while Under Armour has more men buying its clothing. A tie-up solves that dilemma.Lululemon doesn't sell shoes. Under Armour gives them that category on a platter.Lululemon is more about lifestyle wear while Under Armour was founded on performance wear. Together, they could tackle both markets head on giving Nike and Adidas a run for their money.Bottom Line for UAA StockIn my opinion (Chip Wilson probably doesn't agree), Lululemon CEO Laurent Potdevin would make an ideal leader of the combined company because he has managed to re-ignite LULU profitability over the past three years while continuing to improve its sourcing and quality control.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) Stock Pops Amid Higher Menu PricesWhile it's not perfect, the team in place is a heck of a lot better than it was before his hiring. I see good things ahead for the company and its stock despite the naysayers.Under Armour, on the other hand, has a CEO who is too busy empire building (he's got aliquor brand) to realize that he's losing a war he can't possibly win.As my InvestorPlace colleague James Brumley so aptly said, ""Under Armour stock needs a change, and soon.""Amen to that.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceMonday Apple Rumors: Possible iPhone 8 Design LeaksShould You Buy Tesla, Inc.

Tesla, Inc. Slashes the Price of Model S;4/17/2017;"Just asTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) isdiscontinuingthe 60-kilowatt-hour variant of its Model S, which was its   cheapest and lowest-range version of the all-electric vehicle,   the automaker is significantly lowering the price of the Model S   version with a 75 kWh battery. Here's a closer look at the   aggressive pricing move, and what it might mean for Tesla's   business.An aggressively priced entry-level Model SWhen Tesla announced last month it would be discontinuing its   60 kWh Model S in April, it looked like there would be a large   gap between the $68,000 starting price of the 60 kWh variant and   the $77,000 starting price of the 75 kWh variant -- Tesla's   next-cheapest Model S version. But with the 60 kWh variant now   officially discontinued, Tesla has dropped the price of the 75   kWh Model S by $7,500, giving it a starting price of $69,500.Model S. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();While $69,500 is still $1,500 more than the price of Tesla's   previous entry-level Model S, there is relative value to be found   when the vehicle's features are taken into consideration. The   Model S with the 75 kWh battery, for instance, has significantly   more range than the 60 kWh one did. The 60 kWh base Model S had   about 210 miles of range, while the 75 kWh version can drive up   to 249 miles. In addition, Tesla now includes its all-glass roof   as a standard option. Previously, the glass-roof option would   cost customers an additional $1,500.Along with the price decrease for its 75 kWh Model S version,   Tesla has decreased the price for its dual-motor 75 kWh and   dual-motor 90 kWh versions. But Tesla says it will be increasing   the prices for its flagship 100 kWh models later this month.Why these pricing moves make senseThe net impact of these pricing changes will likely be   positive for Tesla. The changes could potentially increase demand   for Model S while also helping the electric-car maker maintain   its profit margin -- two key areas for the company right now.Tesla could use a boost to Model S demand for several reasons.   First, Tesla's lower-cost Model 3's July launch is approaching   fast; its availability could cannibalize some Model S sales.   Second, while Tesla's overall vehicle sales have continued to   climb, rising sales recently have primarily been driven by   Tesla's newer Model X SUV; a lower price for Model S, therefore,   could help Tesla either prevent a decline in Model S demand or   possibly even catalyze higher demand for the sedan.Data source: Tesla quarterly SEC filings and delivery press     releases. Chart by author.While a lower starting price for Model S would drag Tesla's   automotive profit margin lower, management seems to believe the   upcoming price increase for flagship versions of the vehicle will   offset the negative impacts of a lower-priced entry-level Model   S, possibly helping Tesla maintain itsheady profit margin.""We expect our total average selling price to remain almost   exactly the same,"" Tesla said in a statement to press on   Monday.Tesla's automotive gross profit margin is particularly   important as the company brings its Model 3 to market later this   year. With the Model 3's more aggressive $35,000 starting price,   Tesla will need robust gross profit margins from its   higher-priced vehicles to help it manage the initial steep costs   of Model 3 as the company ramps up the newer vehicle's production   rate.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) Stock Pops Amid Higher Menu Prices;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.(NYSE:CMG) has been raising prices across several hundred locations, according to a number of reports trickling out over the weekend and into Monday. As a result, CMG stock is getting a small bump in Monday's trade.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSpecifically, Chipotle has raised prices by about 5% across 440 of its stores - that's about 20% of its U.S. locations. Chipotle spokesperson Chris Arnold confirmed the report.The new pricing is meant to even out increased workforce costs and food-price inflation, though ""even with the new prices, our pricing remains very competitive within the category, particularly if you factor in the quality of ingredients we use,"" Arnold said.Price increases are nothing new to longtime Chipotle fans - the company has made headlines for several menu upticks, which have come in response to minimum-wage hikes, as well as higher costs for things like guacamole and beef.But the current round of price hikes would seem poorly timed, given that CMG is still struggling to recover from its string of food-borne illness outbreaks in the second half of 2015.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?Chipotle's revenues dropped nearly 13% from 2015 to 2016, which included performance such as a 22% decline in same-store sales in Q3 2016, and a 23.6% plunge in comps for Q2 of that year. Margins have suffered, too, dropping from the high 20% area to below 15% at some points. As a result, CMG stock was more than halved from its 2015 highs through its 2016 lows.Don't Be Too Skeptical of CMG StockQuietly, though, CMG stock is actually having itself a nice rebound year in 2017.The company has finally addressed its management woes, booting co-CEO Monty Moran and going with a single-CEO structure with Steve Ells at the helm.Meanwhile, shares have climbed more than 25% year-to-date to pummel the broader market. That's despite a fourth-quarter earnings report in early February that saw earnings of 55 cents miss by two pennies, and revenues of $1.03 billion come in merely in line with expectations.But the Q4 report did show that comps are at least starting to level off, with same-store sales off just 4.8%, which included positive movement in November and December.Technically speaking, you could argue that CMG stock has gotten ahead of itself.Shares are well above their 50- and 200-day moving averages, which formed a bullish ""golden cross"" signal back in March that eventually helped kick off its most recent leg. However, the stock is well into overbought territory, per both its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD readings.Should You Buy Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsYet Chipotle stock still remains roughly 40% off its August 2015 highs, and the next point of price resistance doesn't appear to kick in until the $520 mark, which shares attempted to recover to in the midst of its 2015-16 decline.

Should You Buy Tesla, Inc. Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons (TSLA);4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has an awfully active Twitter account. He used it earlier this month to gloat, tweeting: ""Stormy weather in shortville …"" He's not wrong. TSLA stock has charged up from $180 in late 2016 to a new all-time high of $313 in April 2017.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe bulls have declared victory, suggestingTesla shares are headed for $400, or even higher. Not surprisingly, bears continue to argue that TSLA is overvalued and heading for a massive fall.While momentum clearly is on Tesla's side, it'd be wise not to tune out the bear camp completely. There are still several good reasons why TSLA shares could suffer a serious decline from here.So should you by TSLA stock? We'll take a look at the pros and cons to decide.ConsBloated Market Cap:Over the past month, Tesla stock hit a significant milestone. It passed, at least briefly, the market caps of bothFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM).Yes, I know Musk is a visionary and Tesla is working on a revolutionary future for the auto industry. Still, it's worth taking a moment to consider Tesla's long-term value. General Motors and Ford are both behemoth American companies that are top-tier world competitors. Tesla, by contrast, sells a minuscule number of vehicles and has never shown its business model to be capable of producing consistent profits or cash flow.7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterPonzi Scheme?You often hear TSLA bears describing the company as some sort of accounting trick. However, that negative sentiment went much more mainstream last week.Leading North American vehicle retailerAutoNation, Inc.(NYSE:AN) CEO Mike Jackson used some pointed language recently. He stated that Tesla: ""is either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time"" or that it might turn out alright for investors.From 2009 onward, Tesla's free cash flow has grown increasingly negative. Apart from 2013, the company's cash burn has worsened almost every year. Cash outflow has topped $1 billion each of the past three years. The bail-out of the cash-incineratingSolarCitywill make Tesla's cash generation situation even more perilous.Recent Delivery Momentum May Slow:Tesla recently announced 25,000 deliveries for the previous quarter. That's a record. It's worth considering how Tesla pulled that off.One TSLA stock analystnotedthat Tesla changed its terminology. It used to discuss deliveries to ""end-customers."" Now it simply says ""customers."" Tesla also appears to have sold almost as many vehicles in Asia as North America this quarter; the company typically performs much more strongly in North America.Put it all together, and it suggests that Tesla may have sold a bunch of vehicles to distributors rather than end customers. It's fine if Tesla is setting up a distribution network; it could be a solid strategic move. But don't expect a repeat of this quarter's strong performance if that's the case.ProsProbably Not a Ponzi Scheme:It's not hard to find a mountain of articles suggesting Tesla is near insolvency.In my view, the SolarCity acquisition was utterly indefensible and did much to fuel this bearish line of attack. However, there isn't anything inherently wrong with operating consistently free cash flow negative during the growth stage of a business.For many years, a bears ranted aboutAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and its flimsy balance sheet. The company made little to no cash from operations, to say nothing of earnings per share. If credit markets had frozen over at an inopportune company, Amazon could have been sunk. However, Amazon's calculated risk paid off. It has reached the inflection point where its fiscal position is sound.If Musk can deliver anything close to what he's suggested, Tesla, Inc. will get to that point in a couple of years as well. If you believe in Musk, you want him to lever up now. It will produce better results for TSLA stock in the long run.Tesla Isn't as Unprofitable as People Suggest: A cursory reading of popular sources suggests that Tesla loses money on every vehicle it sells. See headlines such as""Tesla burns cash, loses more than $4,000 on every car sold.""But this idea is based on an incomplete understanding of accounting.Yes, Tesla loses money overall. However, this is due to a lack of scale. On each actual car that Tesla sells, it makes a gross profit. This profit is generally in the 20%-30% range. That's plenty high if you are selling a large number of cars. As it is, Tesla isn't selling enough vehicles to come all its other overhead costs. These costs, such as R&D, get spread across each unit sold. It isn't selling enough - yet. Once again, if Musk can perform, this bearish point will look petty soon enough.Should You Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsBig Lead in Its Niche:Yes, TSLA is trying different things, such as a more mass-market vehicle and therecently announced truck. Who knows if those will pan out? But within its core competency, its luxury electric self-driving vehicle, Tesla has a huge first-mover edge.Other luxury car companies are making electric vehicles. And the other automakers are doing their best to come up with their own autonomous solutions. However, no other automaker has managed to assemble all the parts together so nicely in one package. That's even before you get to the glitzy extras such as the Supercharger network.Bears risk underestimating Tesla's strengths when they smugly assume that competition will eventually bury Tesla.Verdict on TSLA StockTesla is extraordinarily expensive after its recent record-breaking run. There is no way to value it based on traditional metrics, which is why Piper Jaffray's analyst was reduced tousing ""creative"" techniques to justify the company's value.Simply put, if you own TSLA stock, you're betting on Musk. If you think he can drive the company forward, Tesla shares could deliver, even from this starting price.Tesla's bears have griped about the company's overvalution for years now without any success. The market punishes overly smug investors. However, the bears do have real concerns, so if you're sitting on big profits, be careful here. Sentiment can turn quickly, and since Tesla consistently has to raise more money, its stock is especially vulnerable to changing emotions.As of this writing, Ian Bezek did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Is Still a Buy Despite Its Issues;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the bookHow Google Works, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg talk extensively about the convergence of three big trends in business: the Internet, mobile communication, and cloud computing. Semiconductor giantQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this convergence.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIts chip technology has helped power billions of cellphones since its founding in the mid-1980s. QCOM offers both chips and licenses to its technology that resulted in $23.6 billion in sales last year and $7.4 billion in operating cash flow.That 31.4% cash flow margin demonstrates that Qualcomm is fantastically profitable. Last year, that totaled $3.81 in reported earnings. For the full current year, analysts project a big jump in earnings to $4.66 per share on sales of $23.8 billion. They expect only a modest bump in sales and profits for fiscal 2018.The Dangers of QualcommThe slow growth in recent years (sales peaked in fiscal 2014 at $26.5 billion) is a key reason that QCOM stock has sagged. Its highest level was a hair above $81 per share in April 2014. However, shares now trade below $53 per share, close to its lows over the past 52 weeks.The competition also doesn't appreciate that Qualcomm is so dominant. Its CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology is prevalent in nearly every cell phone the 3G and 4G wireless communication standards. Any cell phone manufacturer that makes these handsets has to pay a royalty to Qualcomm.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyThis has led to a slew of legal challenges to its patents. Just this week,Blackberry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY), an erstwhile giant in the cell phone market,was awardedan $815 million ""refund."" A court ruled that Qualcomm owed the refund to Blackberry, suggesting that Blackberry had overpaid on its royalties to Qualcomm because of its flagging sales of Blackberry mobile devices. The decision looks to be binding, and Qualcomm will make the payment out of its large cash reserves.iPhone juggernautApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL)is also fightingwith Qualcomm. The dispute involves both of Qualcomm's businesses - it supplies chips to iPhones, and Apple also pays it royalties. The current spat is said to total $1 billion, or slightly more than the Blackberry settlement.A quick search of Qualcomm's other disputes includeSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Chinese firms includingMeizu. China went after Qualcomm recently, accusing it of violating antitrust rules because of its chip and patent stronghold on mobile devices. Since then, it has sought to settle and renegotiate patent agreements.Add it all up, and investing in Qualcomm is not exactly straightforward.The Bull CaseQCOM stock currently yields close to 4%, though, so there is consolation for patient investors hoping that the company can successfully navigate current and future disputes, and eventually grow steadily again.A considerable cash hoard also helps protect on the downside. First quarter cash and marketable securities totaled nearly $30 billion. Clearly, it can afford a large number of unfavorable patent dispute results, if it came to that.Qualcomm also announced last fall the acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). The deal totals $38 billion and adds chip exposure to new markets including automotive, the internet of things (IoT), data centers, and networking. The deal could be a game changer for QCOM, whose current market capitalization is only about $75 billion.The merger has been approved by NXP Semiconductors shareholders and is expected to close by the end of the year. It will put Qualcomm in more direct competition with other chip providers, includingNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) (autonomous driving cars) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) (cell phones and data centers).Bottom Line on QCOM StockThe NXP Semiconductors purchase offers the best potential for Qualcomm to boost sales and profit growth. However, it is largely outside of its core mobile phone chip expertise. At worst, it suggests QCOM doesn't think its current businesses have appealing growth potential going forward.How to Trade Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Ahead of Q1 EarningsBut at 11.3 times forward earnings estimates and with a dividend yield double that of the overall market, QCOM stock looks like an interesting investment candidate. The low valuation provides downside protection should patent disputes continue to be costly and if the core chip and licensing business fails to grow again.The NXP Semiconductor purchase adds more potential for growth, though the new businesses are also extremely competitive. But while Qualcomm's management figures out the new businesses, the existing ones will continue to generate billions in cash flow for many years to come.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann was long INTC.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Go Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Into Earnings;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) has fallen from recent highs ahead of Tuesday's first-quarter earnings report. However, if we zoom out to a more long-term view, it becomes clear that the recent dip in BAC stock is nothing more than a blip.makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeAfter Bank of America's monstrous run, it's only natural to think that BAC has gone too far too fast. But even at these altitudes, BofA is very humble in value - its price-to-earnings ratio is under 15, and it's selling just under book value.So fundamentally, not most experts would agree that Bank of America is not expensive. Consequently, those who are long the stock are not weak hands. They are likely to stick with it through the short-term dips. Sure, there is risk from the potential of a market-wide correction but on its own, any weakness in BAC stock should present opportunities to go long the stock.Technically, the recent price action leaves Bank of America stock vulnerable to a potential 6% dip to under $21 per share. And given the current macroeconomic environment, I bet that dip would invite a lot of buyers.But it's daunting to jump the gun and commit to going long BAC right before earnings at the stock's current face value.5 Beaten-Up Stocks That Won't Stay Down for LongLuckily, we have options, so we can structure a trade that allows a lot of room for error.How to Trade BAC Stock Right NowThe bet:Sell the BAC Jan 2018 $17 put for 50 cents per contract. This trade has an 85% theoretical chance of success. I need Bank of America shares to stay above $17 for a complete win.Usually I like to balance my trade by selling upside risk, but in this case I will refrain from doing so. Given that I don't mind owning BofA at $17, and given the price buffer, I am willing to be un-hedged long at my chosen level.Selling naked puts in this environment can be risky, especially if I am not able or willing to own BAC shares at $17. So for a tamer version of this trade, I'd sell a credit put spread instead.The alternate:Sell the BAC Jan 2018 $17/$15 credit put spread, where I have the same chance of success, yet still yield 13% on money risked.Apple Inc. Doesn't Need an iPhone Supercycle to SurviveI am not one to chase price targets. But those who foresee a rally in BAC stock can potentially increase profits by buying a near-the-money May debit call spread. Then, they would be long Bank of America stock virtually for free. As long as BAC stays above the sold puts, any premium they recover from selling the debit calls spreads would be pure profit.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3here.

Monday’s Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), United States Steel Corporation (X) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trading lower this morning as geopolitical concerns cast a shadow over the start of earnings season on Wall Street. News of a U.S. bombing run over Afghanistan and heightened tensions with North Korea rattled investor sentiment heading into the holiday weekend. What's more, economic data is also front and center, with March retail sales logging their worst two-month stretch in two years and March consumer prices dropping for the first time in more than a year.makeArticleAd();As a result, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave fallen 0.11%, withS&P 500futures down 0.12% andNasdaq-100futures off 0.07%.On the options front, puts were in demand on Thursday ahead of the holiday break. Roughly 14.7 million calls and 15.6 million puts changed hands on the final trading day of last week.Puts were also quite popular on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rocketed to a ten-month high of 0.96, pushing the 10-day moving average to a two-month high of 0.69.Driving Thursday's options volume,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) drew mixed activity after announcing it would unveil a new electric semi-truck in September and set the final unveiling of the Model 3 in July. Elsewhere,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) launched its Ryzen 5 chipset to relatively positive reviews, but the stock sold off amid more profit taking. Finally,United States Steel Corporation(NYSE:X) was pressured as geopolitical concerns continued to take precedence over domestic infrastructure projects.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla is nothing if not ambitious. Last week, TSLA hinted that it would be adding another vehicle to its stable, anelectric semi-truck. Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered no details on the truck when he tweeted about the vehicle last week. Musk also noted that the company plans to unveil a pickup truck in 18 to 24 months, and set the final unveiling of the new Model 3 in July.7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowTSLA stock has come under considerable fire lately for valuation, and it's beginning to impact options sentiment negatively. On Thursday, volume jumped to 648,000 contracts, with calls only making up 53% of the day's take. April options expire this week, and you can see that short-term speculators are hedging their bets for a decline. Specifically, the April put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 1.15, with puts outnumbering calls among those contracts expiring this Friday. Currently, the $300-strike is home to both peak call OI and peak put OI, making this region a battleground for TSLA heading into the weekend.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD launched its mid-range desktop processor Ryzen 5 last week torather positive reviews. The latest in the Ryzen lineup is designed to offer a lower-cost alternative to its top-of-the-line Ryzen 7 chipset. However, AMD stock was still smacked sharply lower on the week, ending Thursday with a loss of more than 3.5%. The problem for AMD stock isn't that the new Ryzen series isn't selling well, it is. The problem is that many fund managers are afraid to miss out on taking profits, and are rolling those profits into undervalued stocks right now, according toCNBC's Jim Cramer.That said, AMD options traders aren't ready to give up on the shares just yet. Thursday's volume was call heavy, with these typically bullish bets accounting for 67% of the more than 353,000 contracts that changed hands. Furthermore, the May put/call OI ratio remains in bullish territory at 0.63, with calls easily outnumbering puts for the soon-to-be front-month series.Don't Buy Amazon.com, Inc.

Take U.S. Steel's recent price action. With Trump turning his attention to conflicts in the Middle East and North Korea,domestic infrastructure plans have taken a back seat, leaving X investors who were hoping for quick action to update the U.S.'s failing bridges and roadways in the lurch.X stock plunged nearly 6% on Thursday, placing the shares down more than 26% since their February peak near $42.Surprisingly, X options traders are clinging to calls despite the decline. In fact, calls made up 60% of Thursday's volume of more than 247,000 contracts. Furthermore, the May put/call OI ratio has held relatively steady at 0.80 during the past week, even as the decline in X shares has picked up its pace.

Apple Inc. Doesn’t Need an iPhone Supercycle to Survive;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter enjoying a sizzling start to the year and hitting an all-time high, the rally inApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) appears to be cooling off. Shares of Apple stock have been slipping over the past week, probably as investors begin to worry that they're fast approaching nosebleed territory.makeArticleAd();Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashAfter all, AAPL has already exceeded five-year highs on common valuation metrics including price-to-earnings and price-to-book.Those concerns have not been helped by recent Wall Street sentiment regarding the upcoming iPhone 8. Wall Street appears to be deeply divided regarding whether the iPhone 8, to be launched later this year, will spur a mega-buying cycle or simply a good-enough one.The latest analyst to express its reservations is Susquehanna, which reckons that Apple will only ship 100 million iPhone units during H2 vs.110M-115M previously estimated. FBN's Shelby Sherafy has also sounded the alarm, saying that Apple stock's one-way trip higher could come to an untimely end because iPhone 8 will only drive a ""good"" upgrade cycle and not a ""supercycle"" as is widely expected.iPhone 8 Supercycle or Bust?The iPhone 8 is expected to sport pretty cool features, including an OLED screen, 3-D sensors and wireless charging that will supposedly prove too alluring for the throngs of Apple fans.7 High-Yield Stocks That Could Wreck Your RetirementIndeed, bullish analysts might be right on the money if arecent Piper Jaffray surveyon teenage consumer trends is any indication. The survey found that 81% of teens expect their next smartphone to be an iPhone - the highest level of AAPL love ever recorded.Bearish analysts though have countered by pointing out that Apple's track record when it comes to new product launches is nothing to write home about. Apple has already delayed the launch of numerous products in the past, the most recent being iPad Pro 2 by months. Some analysts are a bit optimistic the new iPad could arrive in April, while others are far less sanguine and expect an October launch.A September launch had initially been chalked in for iPhone 8 - now it appears eager buyers won't be getting their hands on the iconic smartphone till much later. There are reports that the new iPhone could bedelayed by weeks or even months. The delay appears to be in connection to the use of curved OLED screens that eliminate the bezels. Why that should be a major issue considering thatSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has been using them on its smartphones for years is anyone's guess.All that hullabaloo about iPhone 8 delay is not hard to fathom. Buyers of tech hardware are notorious for delaying their purchases when a new iteration is due to hit the shelves. The longer AAPL delays the iPhone 8 launch, the more H2 sales are bound to suffer … which in turn could see Apple stock take a big hit.Could Trump Come to the Rescue?In reality, though, it would take a really bad delay - maybe a month or more - for Apple's top line to get dinged. AAPL is set to enjoy easy comps thanks to last year's awful sales, especially during the latter part of 2016.Apple endured double-digit sales contraction after posting revenue declines of 12.8% for Q1 FY16, 14.5% for Q2 FY16 and 8.9% for Q4 FY16 before returning to growth during Q1 FY17, when it posted modest growth of 3.3%. Apple sold a mere 45.5 milllion and 78.4 million iPhone units during the third and final quarters of 2016. I believe the company can easily top that figure even in the event that iPhone 8 is delayed for two to three weeks.In any case, investors have already been warned about a possible delay, so the bad news is probably already baked into Apple stock.It's more likely that developments in Washington will play a bigger role in determining the trajectory for AAPL.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Netflix, Inc. (NFLX), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL)Both President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have proposed broad tax cuts in a bid to entice American companies to bring back home at least part of the $2 trillion they have stashed in overseas accounts. Apple has more than $240 billion in cash and investments, most of which is parked in offshore accounts. Bringing home at least part of that bounty could help the company hunt for growth companies and stop over-relying on the iPhone.Moreover, CEO Cook has already indicated a willingness for the company to ditch its timid M&A policy.Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA), anybody?Bottom Line on Apple StockSteve Mnuchin recently said that Trump's administration has a target to pass the new tax plan before Congress goes on recess in August. The last comprehensive tax reform of 1986 took more than a year to complete, so it's going to be tough for the administration to pull off the feat in a matter of months. Investors will no doubt also be apprehensive after the Republican gridlock that stymied the proposed American Health Care Act.The good news though is that there's much more agreement on tax reform than there ever was on the healthcare bill.An iPhone 8 supercycle certainly would be great for Apple stock. But AAPL could still receive another adrenaline shot if the proposed tax reform sails through.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTrade of the Day: Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI)7 Energy Stocks That Will Turn 2017 on Its Head10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017The postApple Inc.

3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Netflix, Inc. (NFLX), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL);4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMonday will kick off what should be a more lively week, with many returning from spring break and taking last week's holiday-shortened stretch. They'll be coming back to dig into the Q1 earnings season, which will see banks and a few tech names dominate headlines.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Heading into the new week, the spotlight is shining onTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL), which made some waves over the weekend, as well asNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), which will help kick off the earnings slate with its Monday evening report.Here's what you should know:Netflix Inc (NFLX)NFLX shares are slightly on the rise Monday morning, just a few hours ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report.Analysts are expecting a boffo quarter for the streaming video giant, estimating sales growth of nearly 35% to $2.64 billion, filtering down to a 516% increase in earnings (from 6 cents per share to 37 cents). The though is that $1.48 billion of the top line will come from domestic streaming, with another $1.05 billion from international streaming and $121 million in the still-existent DVD shipping business.7 High-Yield Stocks That Could Wreck Your RetirementOne of the big worries for Netflix is its difficult path to adding more U.S. subscribers, especially amid a set of content releases that were less than impressive. That's worrisome given how much Netflix is spending to create said content - $6 billion in 2016, and a projected $7 billion next year. And given slowing U.S. subscriber growth, it's likely that NFLX will have to reach even further into its pocket for additional ad spending and other marketing.On the flipside, if Netflix continues its breakneck international growth, that might be enough to get investors to mostly ignore any weakness domestically.Netflix's report is due out after Monday's bell. NFLX shares are up about 15% year-to-date.United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL)United was given a weekend to duck back into the shadows and stop generating negative headlines … and failed miserably.A couple that was trying to travel from Houston to Costa Rica for their wedding this weekend claim that they were kicked off a United flight. The couple says a man was lying across their seats on a half-filled flight, so they sat a few rows forward in the same area of the plane.United has countered by saying that the couple were attempting to upgrade their seats to a more comfortable part of the plane.""We thought not a big deal, it's not like we are trying to jump up into a first-class seat,"" Michael Hohl told the news station. ""We were simply in an economy row a few rows above our economy seat.""The incident follows a PR nightmare in which United ordered a man to dragged off a flight by authorities, leaving him with a bloody nose, while trying to procure seating for some of its own personnel. The backlash prompted United to change a policy that now demands a flight crew must be seated on their flight at least one hour ahead of departure time.UAL shares are off 5% year-to-date.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Reports are starting to trickle out about how Tesla will begin producing its new Model 3.10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio ForeverInsideEVs, citing the Tesla Model 3 Owners Club, reports a ""source who has been quite reliable so far"" says Tesla will start by building similarly configured Model 3s, and only build custom models later on - ""more of an inventory sales approach.""Those who want all-wheel variants of the Model 3 will likely have to wait until next year, according to a statement previously written by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.The upside to this particular approach is that it would streamline the process, helping to cut down on errors early on, and speed up production. Tesla is hoping to begin full-scale production in July of this year.TSLA, in the meanwhile, has enjoyed breakneck gains of more than 40% so far in 2017.More From InvestorPlaceThe 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyVanguard Dividend Funds3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of IncomeThe post3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Netflix, Inc.

Tesla Inc. Earnings: Mark Your Calendar;4/16/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) plans to announce its results for its first   quarter of 2017 on Wednesday, May 3, the company said on   Thursday. Ahead of its important Model 3 launch later this year,   the quarterly update comes at a critical time for the company.   Not only will it help investors get a glimpse into Tesla's   financials ahead of its plans for a rapid ramp-up in vehicle   production, but it will likely provide some insight into Tesla's   progress on bringing its Model 3 to market.Ahead of Tesla's earnings release, here are three things   investors might want to start thinking about.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();1. Expect a meaty automotive gross profit     margin.For Tesla, making electric vehicles has proved to be quite   lucrative on a per-vehicle basis. Sure, the company is spending   billions of dollars on expanding its business, leading to overall   losses. But investors can take comfort in the company's solid   automotive gross profit margin, knowing that if Tesla wanted to   report profits today it could simply scale back its growth   ambitions.Tesla's non-GAAP automotive gross margin, which excludes zero   emission vehicle credits and stock-based compensation, was 22.2%   in the company's most recent quarter. Its GAAP automotive gross   margin was 22.6%. In Q1, however, Tesla expects an even better   automotive gross margin. Management said in the company's   fourth-quarter update it expects non-GAAP and GAAP automotive   gross profit margins to ""recover in Q1 to Q3 2016 levels and then   continue to expand in Q2 2017."" The company's non-GAAP and GAAP   automotive gross profit margins in the third quarter of 2016 were   25% and 29.4%, respectively.2. Capital expenditures may rise sharply.Potentially giving investors some insight into the   aggressiveness of Tesla's preparations for high-volume Model 3   production, investors can look to Tesla's capital spending for   the quarter. While Tesla didn't provide specific guidance for its   capital spending in the first quarter, it did say it expected to   spend between $2 billion and $2.5 billion during the first half   of the year -- well above Tesla's $1.3 billion in capital   expenditures during the entire year of 2016.""We continue to focus on capital efficiency while also   investing in battery cell, pack and energy storage production at   Gigafactory 1,"" Tesla said about its plans for capital   expenditures.Rapidly rising Model X deliverieshelped Tesla report record deliveries in Q1. Image source:     author.3. Will Tesla raise its guidance for vehicle     deliveries?Since Tesla has already shared its vehicle deliveries for its   first quarter -- arecord 25,000 units-- investors will likely turn their attention to any commentary   on what to expect from Model S and Model X deliveries in Q2.Going into Tesla's first quarter of 2017, the company said it   expected to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X units   combined. So, with about 25,000 units already delivered, this   leaves about 22,000 to 25,000 units left to be delivered during   the first half of the year. Will Tesla raise its guidance for   vehicle deliveries during the first half of the year after such a   strong first quarter?Tesla plans to post its earnings release for its first quarter   after market close on May 2.

Think You've Seen Crazy Valuations? Wait Till You See These 3 Stocks;4/15/2017;"Sometimes, the market goes a little overboard with certain   stocks. Whether that's bidding them up well beyond reasonable   levels or selling them off at insanely cheap prices, some stocks   just end up with crazy valuations. Three that have us scratching   our heads right now areTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) , andSunoco LP(NYSE: SUN) . Here's why.Someone apply the brakes, pleaseSean Williams(Tesla):While it's seemingly no struggle to find expensive   valuations in today's market, no stock stands out as perhaps more   egregiously overvalued than electric-vehicle and solar-panel   maker Tesla. I have a number of concerns with the company, so   let's tackle them one at a time.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();To begin with, I have a hard time supporting Tesla's monstrous   $49 billion valuation, which is approaching that ofGeneral Motorsand is higher thanFord's, yet the company still isn't profitable on a recurring basis.   GM reported record full-year earnings per share in 2016, with   automotive-adjusted free cash flow of $6.9 billion, while Ford   reported $4.6 billion in net income and $6.4 billion in   automotive operating cash flow last year. Tesla? It wound up   losing $675 million in net income and burned through $1.56   billion cash for the entire year. In fact, its accumulated losses   since 2007 have approached nearly $3 billion. And yet, it's now   worth $49 billion.Another issue is that Tesla has a habit of overpromising and   underdelivering on those promises. The Model S and Model X were   both delayed due to various production issues, which leaves me   highly skeptical that the company will be able to meet its   production targets on the Model 3. And, for matter, keep in mind   that so far Tesla is only on track to produce 100,000 vehicles   this year.Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity may also come back to   bite it. In the fourth quarter, SolarCity only installed 201 MW   of solar energy, which was nearly 100 MW lower than what   SolarCity had originally forecast for the quarter, just a few   months prior. While SolarCity offers intriguing long-term   potential, it's another cut to Tesla's already   bleeding balance sheet.Finally, Tesla's cash needs are enormous, and investors might   continue to pay the price for its neediness. Recently, the   company announced that it would sell $750 million in convertible   notes (which means possible dilution down the road) and $250   million in common stock. This correlates to the high expenses   tied to its Gigafactory and production increases for the Model 3.   With a cash outflow expected for years to come, Tesla might   continue to dilute investors in order to raise capital.Without any recurring profits, Tesla's $49 billion valuation   is simply ludicrous.An expensive turnaround storyJordan Wathen(Chipotle Mexican Grill):Chipotle Mexican Grill shares trade at a 40% discount to their   peak price, but I think there's reason to believe that the stock   is still overvalued.Shares currently trade at about 45 times a ""stretch"" earnings   goal of $10 per share in 2017, but bulls expect that earnings   will ramp even higher in coming years. The thesis is predicated   on the idea that customers who avoided the company's restaurants   following E. coli outbreaks last year will return over time.At best, I think Chipotle has a very difficult road to   recovery. At worst, I think the brand is permanently impaired, as   customers who took a break from the burrito chain discovered   substitutes.With heavy promotions and discounts to drive traffic, Chipotle   has trained its customers to expect discounts at the same time   that input costs are growing at mid-single-digit rates. On the   most recent conference call, Chipotle indicated that labor costs   grew 5% in the last year, and it expected continued 4% to 5%   inflation in labor costs going forward. On the same call,   management spoke to the difficulties of raising prices, saying,   ""We've not had a price increase in three years... at some point   over time, we'll need to pass on some of the higher costs... but   we believe we'll be able to do that.""For Chipotle to recover, it needs to manage expenses by   controlling food costs (or raising prices), cut down   its marketing spend to a historical level of 2.1% of sales   from an outsize 5.1% of sales in 2016, and do it without   sacrificing customer traffic. That's no easy task for any   restaurant chain.From crazy expensive to insanely cheapMatt DiLallo(Sunoco LP):At first glance, fuel distribution company Sunoco LP looks   absurdly expensive, trading at 112 times enterprise   value-to-EBITDA (a common valuation metric for master limited   partnerships). However, upon closer inspection, an entirely   different story emerges, one that suggests that Sunoco LP is   actually incredibly cheap.One of the reasons Sunoco LP appears to trade at a nosebleed   valuation is that 2016 was a brutal year, which caused   significant downward pressure on earnings. Overall, EBITDA   plunged from $612 million in 2015 to a mere $71 million last   year. However, some of that decline was due to one-time items   such as impairment charges, which totaled $680 million last year.   Once we adjust for those and other items to normalize earnings,   Sunoco LP's adjusted EBITDA was $665 million, which was only down   $50 million from the prior year's adjusted EBITDA. If we plug   that number into the equation, Sunoco LP's EV-to-EBITDA is just   11.8 times, which is well below the mid-teens ratio of most other   MLPs.That said, there are good reasons that Sunoco LP has such a   cheap relative valuation . Not only does it have a worrisomely   high debt level, but it also distributed more cash to investors   than it collected. However, the company appears to have addressed   those concerns by recently sealing a deal to unload the bulk of   its retail stores for $3.3 billion in cash. It expects both its   leverage and coverage ratios to improve significantly once that   transaction closes later this year. As a result, it can focus on   building out its stable fuel distribution business, which could   position it to restart dividend growth in the future.While Sunoco LP is higher-risk than most other MLPs, it's dirt   cheap despite recently securing a deal that firmed up its   financial footing. Because of that, investors willing to take on   more risk could be getting a steal with Sunoco LP if its   repositioning plan works.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Created the Insane 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon;4/15/2017;"After weeks of hype and teases,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) let the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon out of its   cage in an appropriately over-the-top event in New York this past   week.Yes, there was an actual cage -- and a whole lot of tire   smoke. But there was some solid business thinking behind the   madness.The 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon was released from its     ""cage"" at a raucous event in New York on Tuesday. Image source:     Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.makeArticleAd();What is this thing?Let's put it this way: If the707-horsepower Hellcat versionof the Challenger wasn't enough for you, the 840-horsepower Demon   might be what you want -- at least, if what you want is to go   drag racing. (Or to brag about quarter-mile times.)Although many parts are new, the Demon is best thought of as a   Hellcat that has been souped up even further in pursuit of   drag-strip bragging rights. Its engine is based on the Hellcat   V8, a 6.2-liter supercharged beast, with heavier-duty parts, a   larger supercharger, and some unique go-even-faster technologies   aimed at maximizing the car's acceleration and drag-strip   performance.It all works. When launched in the proper drag-racing manner,   the Demon accelerates so fiercely that its front wheels lift off   of the ground -- something that was demonstrated live on stage at   the car's reveal event. Dodge claims the Demon is the world's   fastest-accelerating production car, with a   zero-to-60-miles-per-hour time of just 2.3 seconds, and a   quarter-mile time of 9.65 seconds at 140 miles per hour.(Yes,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) fans will quibble with that zero-to-60 time; Dodge   fans will quibble with the ""rolling start"" launch that generated   the very slightly faster time recorded by aModel S in Ludicrous mode; expect those and other arguments to be resolved on America's   drag strips over the next year, with plenty of evidence uploaded   to YouTube.)Inside, the Demon is still a Challenger, with most of the same   features offered on the top-trim Hellcat -- only less so. In a   move that is probably as much about trash talk as it is about   weight savings, the Demon comes standard with only one seat, for   the driver. (The other seats can be added back in as an option,   priced at $1 each.)Yes, the Demon comes standard with just one seat. The others     can be added back in, for $1 each. Image source: Fiat Chrysler     Automobiles.Is there an actual business case for the Demon?It may seem like a lot of silly over-the-top fun, but the   Demon has a real mission: to put an even brighter halo above the   Dodge brand's already-solid reputation for performance. Think of   it as a big, bold brand-marketing exercise that will probably   turn a solid profit for FCA.That was also themission of the Hellcatwhen it was launched back in 2015, of course. Think of the Demon   as a way to update and boost the (highly effective) kick that the   Hellcat gave to the Dodge brand's luster and desirability among   performance-minded car enthusiasts.The Demon might also turn out to be a nod to the brand's   longtime fans, one that heralds the beginning of the end of an   era. An all-new Challenger based on the vehicle architecture   developed for Alfa Romeo is expected to make its debut in the   next year or two. If so, this is a fitting last hurrah for a car   that has inspired a devoted following.The Dodge Challenger SRT Demon's fender flares accommodate     wide drag-strip-ready tires. Image source: Fiat Chrysler     Automobiles.What will the Dodge Demon cost?No price has yet been announced, but the safest bet in Detroit   is that the Demon won't be cheap. Dodge brand chief Tim Kuniskis   said that only 3,300 Demons will be made: 3,000 for the U.S., and   another 300 for Canada. That's it. It's a one-time deal, for one   year only.Given the scarcity, and the care with which FCA has stoked the   market for the Demon, it's a given that you'll have to pay up if   you want one. The Challenger SRT Hellcat, the current   top-of-the-line model, starts at a little over $64,000. Expect   the Demon's sticker price to be considerably higher -- and dealer   markups to be huge.Regardless of the sticker price, I expect that quite a few   Demons will be sold at six-figure prices.When will the Demon be available?Production begins in late summer, Kuniskis said, and   deliveries to dealers will begin in the fall.If you want one, I suggest talking to your favorite FCA dealer   sooner rather than later.10 stocks we like better than Fiat Chrysler     AutomobilesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;4/15/2017;"We're only a couple of weeks away from the solar industry's   first-quarter earnings reports, which will give us an idea of how   companies are doing in this dynamic year for the industry.   Companies are grappling with low prices for solar panels and an   unstable financing and demand environment across residential,   commercial, and utility-scale solar.This week, we got some interesting data on installation   prices, as well as news that gave us clues about where suppliers   may be headed in the future. Here's what we learned.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Big solar installers are no longer price-competitiveI've been warning thatTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity,Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) , andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) are in a tough position competing against smaller,   regional installers, and there's a new report backing that view   with data.A report by theNational Renewable Energy Laboratoryshows that large installers (Tesla, Sunrun, and Vivint) are   pricing systems about 10% higher than smaller installers.   Overall, large installers average $3.99 per watt to install   solar, while smaller installers charge $3.62 per watt. When   quotes for similar homes are matched, the difference is   $0.33 per watt, which would be $1,980 for a 6 kW   installation.The higher cost structure for larger installers is now   starting to show, and smaller installers are gaining market share   and showing customers better pricing. This isn't good if you're   looking at investing in one of the big installers.Capacity is still being built in solarPV-Tech released a preliminary analysis of global   solar manufacturing capacity expansionsthis week, and February was an unusually big month for capacity   announcements. In an industry that's already oversupplied and saw   module prices fall about one-third last year, that may sound   strange, but when you look at who's adding capacity and what   they're adding, it makes a little more sense.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) will see the biggest expansion, with a 5 GW   agreement in China. The news is based on Chinese media reports   and the project hasn't been officially announced by SunPower yet,   but look for something to be said about this capacity on the   first-quarter 2017 earnings call. This would be related to   SunPower's P-Series product, which uses commodity front-contact   cells from third parties to make solar panels with slightly   higher efficiency than competitors can make. The company has big   hopes for the product, so watch any word on performance of the   P-Series closely.JinkoSolar(NYSE: JKS) also announced 500 MW of new cell and 1.5 GW of   new-module capacity, according to PV-Tech. In March,Hanwha Q Cells(NASDAQ: HQCL) announced 1.2 GW of high-efficiency multi-and   mono-PERC manufacturing, the next generation of solar cells.One thing that stands out about these expansions is that   they're being made by the industry's biggest companies and   they're trending toward technology that emphasizes efficiency.   Slowly but surely, we're seeing a consolidation of power in   solar, so differentiation on efficiency will be key going   forward.News and notesHere are a few other notable items for the weekYingli Green Energyreported fourth-quarter 2016 earnings     resultsand there wasn't a lot of good news for hopeful investors.     Revenue was $294.0 million on 635.1 MW of module shipments and     gross margin was just 7%. Net loss for the quarter was $267.1     million, or $14.70 per share. Bankruptcy or insolvency is     likely in Yingli's future; as I mentioned above, there's a     consolidation of power, and this will be one of the losers in     that power struggle.Spain announced a 3 GW renewable-energy tender this week,     which seems like great news for the solar industry, which has     been a big winner of energy tenders around the world. But the     country set up a price floor and any tie will go to the energy     source that produces the most energy per day. In other words,     wind will win this tender over solar, at least until Spain     enacts a more balanced tender process.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) sold two solar power plants in China, totaling     69.5 MW, to Shenzhen Energy this week for $99.8 million. This     is a notable infusion of cash for the company, and the $1.44     per watt price is slightly higher than the $1.34 management     assumed overall when stating that it has $1.6 billion of     operating power plants on its balance sheet.That's all for this week in solar, but check back to Fool.com   for more coverage.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

What Investors Missed in the Market This Week;4/14/2017;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both dropped   lower this week, and both closed below their 50-day moving   averages for the first time since November on Wednesday. Markets   traded slowly into the holiday-shortened week, as they closed in   observance of Good Friday. Still, there were some companies   making big headlines or big moves. Here are some highlights.Be careful what you wish for!It's been a trendy topic to poke atTesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) absurd valuations over the years, or to poke at   its controversial acquisitions, but the markets keep on devouring   what Musk is selling, sendingTesla stockto new highs recently.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();However, an influential group of investors is applying a bit   of pressure to Tesla in hopes of adding two board directors with   no ties to Elon Musk -- a hint that there are concerns regarding   the company's direction. Currently, five of six board members   have personal or professional connections to Musk, and a group of   investors is hoping to get yearly director elections, rather than   vote every three years, in addition to the two independent board   members.Seemingly irritated over the development and constant prodding   about anything from Tesla's valuation to the company's strategy,   Musk did his best to channel his inner Donald Trump and took to   Twitter. ""This investor group should buy Ford stock,"" Musk posted   on Twitter, Wednesday. ""Their governance is amazing.""While Tesla has the potential to turn an industry on its head   by skipping dealerships and selling directly to consumers, as   well as creating an energy empire on top of its electric   vehicles, Musk should be careful what he wishes for.Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) is putting $4.5 billion into electrifying its vehicle   portfolio, it's developing smart mobility projects to contend   with start-ups such as Uber, and it's trading at a ridiculously   cheap valuation with a 5.3% dividend yield. Investors could do a   lot worse than purchasing shares of Ford at these prices.A shiny new stakeWhole Foods Market(NASDAQ: WFM) was a wild success story for its investors between   2009 and 2014, but over the past couple of years, the stock price   has gained little to no traction. Yet shares were up about 10% on   Monday as activist investor firm Jana Partners disclosed a new   8.8% stake in Whole Foods Market, citing the following, according   to the13D filingwith the SEC:JANA has substantial experience analyzing and investing in     the grocery sector and more broadly across the food and retail     sectors, and the other Reporting Persons collectively possess     significant operational, financial, and nutritional expertise,     including, for some of the other Reporting Persons, experience     creating significant shareholder value in the food and grocery     sectors.At first glance, this new stake by Jana doesn't materially   change the investment thesis for Whole Foods Market, but aWall Street Journalreport hinted that Jana will push for operational improvements   and a potential sale of the company. Investors who have held on   over the past couple of years might as well ride this out. If   management and its new activist partner can help drive   operational improvements and increase its private-label   penetration to increase margins, then a sale for a decent premium   to its current price -- perhaps to the mid-$40 range -- is a   possible and valuable outcome.When two became oneIn other news, shares ofKnight Transportation(NYSE: KNX) and former rivalSwift Transportation(NYSE: SWFT) traded higher starting Monday after announcing the   companies would combine. The stocks then gave back some gains   over the course of this week.Looking at the details, the companies announced an all-stock   transaction that will create the largest full truckload company.   When the dust settles, Swift shareholders will control about 54%   of the stock, despite Knight actually being named as the   ""accounting acquirer."" Swift Chairman Richard Dozer said in   a press release:This is a terrific opportunity for our stockholders, who     stand to benefit from the significant upside potential of this     transaction. Indeed, by coming together under common ownership,     the companies will be able to capitalize on economies of scale     to achieve substantial synergies.The combined company will generate about $5 billion in annual   revenue and expects to generate $15 million in cost savings this   year alone. The synergies are expected to save roughly $100   million in 2018 and $150 million in 2019. For two companies   operating as rivals in a low-margin industry, this absolutely is   a merger for investors to be cheering.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Introduces Solar Panels Ahead of Gigafactory 2 Opening;4/14/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) quietly released a new solar panel this week,   pushing the company closer to a differentiated product in the   residential solar industry. If you've seen any media coverage   about the announcement, like that fromQuartz,International Business Times, orInc.com, you might think this changes the solar industry forever. IB   Times proclaimed that Tesla will ""take the ugly out of solar""   overnight with one new product and Quartz said the panels were   ""barely visible.""But Tesla isn't releasing much in the way of information about   this new product,except   a few pictures and limited technical data. What we've learned so far isn't as revolutionary as many of the   headlines make it seem.Tesla's solar panel design that will soon begin rolling out     to customers. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();What we know about Tesla's solar panelsTesla says it's introducing solar panels that ""exceed industry   standards for durability and lifespan,"" according to the   company's website, and early reports from Electrek (in an   article that has subsequently been taken down) say that the   efficiency of those solar panels will be 21.76%. But there's no   official industry standard for durability or lifespan, so that   could mean anything. As for the efficiency number, it's   incomplete and vague, at best, which I'll explain below.What wasn't advertised on Tesla's website is that this isn't a   Tesla manufactured product at all. They are actuallyPanasonicsolar panels sold exclusively through Tesla and they're likely   coming from a Panasonic-owned plant, not the Gigafactory 2 that's   due to start production this summer. These also aren't   panels made with Silevo technology, which has been abandoned   since Tesla bought SolarCity. Instead, Tesla is either buying   Panasonic solar panels and putting its name on them or, if these   will come from the Gigafactory 2, they're Panasonic panels made   in Tesla's facility.What's unique about the product is Tesla's racking design,   which is described as a ""sleek, low-profile design,"" including an   edge skirt, an edging that reduces the sharp line at the edge of   the solar installation to blend into the roof. But it's not   entirely new to the world. The low-profile, easy-to-install   design is similar toSunPower's(NASDAQ: SPWR) Equinox product that was introduced last year,   and there's no indication Tesla's product will be more efficient   than SunPower's.This isn't to say that the complete design solution isn't   important. Designing panels to integrate with racking helps move   work from the roof to the manufacturing floor, which could be an   advantage for Tesla's cost structure. And aesthetics is becoming   more important to customers. But Tesla isn't really doing   anything that isn't already available on the market.SunPower's X-Series panels with a low-profile design     introduced in 2016. Image source: SunPower.Efficiency is important, but Tesla/Panasonic is not the   industry leaderIt's not yet clear what the reported 21.76% efficiency number   for Panasonic/Tesla panels means, if it's true. Does it refer to   cell efficiency or module efficiency? I emailed Tesla, and   they wouldn't answer or provide data sheets, only saying,   ""We're not releasing any additional information right now.""If the original Electrek report of a 21.76% efficient module   is true, it would be among the industry's best, but there are   indications that that efficiency number might actually be for a   cell, not the module. Tesla says the new panel is a 325-watt   design, comparable toPanasonic's 320-watt offeringthat has 21.6% efficient cells and a 19.1% efficient panel.   However, Panasonic also makes a330-watt panel that's 19.7% efficient on a module   level. If the reported 21.76% efficiency is really a cell-level   efficiency number, it would imply that the panels for Tesla are   similar to Panasonic's other modules and provide no   differentiation. And note that Panasonic shut down some of   its own solar manufacturing capacity because it was no longer   cost-competitive with other products in the market. If there's no   efficiency or cost improvement between Panasonic and Tesla, this   won't be a differentiated product at all. But Tesla isn't   clarifying any details about efficiency yet.When Tesla releases data sheets specifying whether the   efficiency numbers are at a cell or panel level, it will be clear   whether this is an industry-leading product or a fairly average   solar product. SunPower's X22 solar panel is22.2% efficient, according to its data sheet, and management said during its last quarterly conference   call that cells are now 25% efficient, implying that actual   module efficiency is trending closer to 23%. That's the bar for   Tesla to surpass to be an industry leader.Tesla isn't a solar disruptor yetIf Tesla is going to make the SolarCity acquisition work and   justify Gigafactory 2, it needs to make differentiated solar   panels itself, and while this new solar module is a step in that   direction, it's not clear how differentiated the company's   product will actually be. But with Panasonic essentially running   Tesla's solar manufacturing, investors shouldn't get the idea   that this product is a game changer. Tesla could have bought   panels with similar efficiency to Panasonic's on the open   market without building a manufacturing plant or entering into a   long-term partnership with Panasonic.And if it really wanted to be an efficiency leader, Tesla   should have bought SunPower,as I wrote about last July. This recent announcement still doesn't prove that Tesla's   product is any better than SunPower's either aesthetically or   technically, despite what many of the headlines might imply.   Until we hear more, we don't even know if Tesla's panel is better   than what Panasonic was already making for sale in the open   market.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla, Inc.'s Model 3: Final Unveiling in July;4/13/2017;"One of the key facets behind electric-car makerTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) soaring stock price in recent months is   increasing confidence from investors in the company's ability to   ramp-up vehicle production from an annualized run rate of about   100,000 units today to management's target for as many as 500,000   units next year. But Tesla will need to successfully launch its   higher-volume, lower-cost Model 3 first before it can take its   production to the next level.On this note, Tesla is back with some more news on its crucial   Model 3 launch. The final unveiling of the Model 3 will be in   July, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said onTwitterThursday.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();What to expect from the Model 3 unveilingBased on how Tesla went about the final unveiling of its Model   X SUV in late 2015, a final unveiling of the Model 3 could   include the first deliveries of the vehicle to customers, along   with details on the big unknown facts about the vehicle, such as   battery capacity options, official EPA-rated range on a single   charge, and the vehicle's finalized design -- inside and out.Up until Thursday, it wasn't clear when Tesla would be holding   an event for the final unveiling of its Model 3. While Tesla said   it would begin Model 3 production in July, Musk suggested the   company might continue to keep details about the $35,000 vehicle   secret as long as possible, particularly since the first   deliveries were slated to go to employees, anyway.""I think it's important for us to have a good feedback ... on   the product that we're making and if there are any issues or   valuable things that need to be addressed that we can address   those before customers experience them,"" Musk explained in   Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call.Musk went on to say that the unveiling could be as soon as a   few months from its Feb. 22 earnings call or ""as far as July   itself."" Apparently, Musk opted to keep as many secrets about   Model 3 as possible for as long as possible.As far as what exactly the final unveiling might reveal about   Model 3 is still a mystery. Musk stated in the company's   fourth-quarter earnings call that the final version will be   ""pretty close"" to the prototype unveiled last year, ""but with   polish and refinement and a few more details that are added.""In addition, Musk said: ""It will be better than what was   unveiled. And I guess in some ways, it will be a lot better.""   Could Musk be any more vague?The main details investors know today is that it will have at   least 215 miles of range on a single charge, be slightly smaller   than the Model S, include Autopilot hardware as standard -- but   customers will have to pay to activate ""Enhance Autopilot"" -- and   have a starting price at about half of the Model S' starting   price.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.But don't expect volume Model 3 deliveries yetDespite a target month for the final unveiling of Model 3,   investors should keep their expectations in check. After the   stock's 51% rise in the past six months, investors are already   pricing in not only a successful Model 3 launch, but a   well-executed production ramp to unit-volume levels that Tesla   has never achieved.In addition, while production of Model 3 and a final unveiling   of the vehicle are coming in July, it's going to take time for   the company to begin producing the vehicle in meaningful volumes.   Tesla isn't aiming to achieve ""volume production"" until   September, the company said in its fourth-quarter shareholder   letter.While it's not clear what volume production in September would   look like, Tesla expects to exit 2017 producing Model 3 at about   5,000 units a week.

"Tesla Inc. to Unveil ""Next Level"" Semi This Year";4/13/2017;"In an update on its long-term plans last summer,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said one of the company's main   priorities in the future will be to expand its vehicle offerings   ""to cover the major forms of terrestrial transport,"" including   commercial vehicles like ""heavy-duty trucks and high   passenger-density urban transport.""When Tesla announced plans for these vehicles last year, they   were in the early stages of development and were excepted to be   unveiled in 2017. While there's no new information on Tesla's   passenger vehicle, Musk said onTwitterThursday that the heavy-duty truck, or ""Tesla Semi,"" is on track   for an unveiling in September.Image source: Author.makeArticleAd();Tesla commercial vehicles""Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September,"" Musk tweeted.   ""Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.""Few things are known about Tesla's semi, but Musk did say in   the company's ""Master Plan, Part Deux"" blog post last year that   the Semi will ""deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of   cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun   to operate.""Tesla isn't the first company to show an interest in electric   semis. Indeed, Mercedes-Benz has already started small-series   production of an all-electric heavy-duty truck, which it calls   the Urban eTruck. Capable of about 125 miles of range, the Urban   eTruck is focused on short-distance applications.The Tesla Semi would just be one facet of Tesla's plan to move   beyond its consumer vehicles, which currently include its Model S   sedan, Model X SUV, and its upcoming higher-volume, lower-cost   Model 3 sedan. The other main commercial vehicle Tesla wants to   bring to market is its high passenger-density urban transport   vehicle, or what Tesla has also called the ""Tesla minibus.""The minibus, which Tesla says isn't the official name of the   vehicle yet, will be built on the company's Model X platform,   Musk noted in the company's second-quarter earnings call last   year. Musk explained the reasoning of an all-electric minibus in   more detail in the company's master plan last summer.With the advent of autonomy, it will probably make sense to     shrink the size of buses and transition the role of bus driver     to that of fleet manager. Traffic congestion would improve due     to increased passenger areal density by eliminating the center     aisle and putting seats where there are currently entryways,     and matching acceleration and braking to other vehicles, thus     avoiding the inertial impedance to smooth traffic flow of     traditional heavy buses. It would also take people all the way     to their destination. Fixed summon buttons at existing bus     stops would serve those who don't have a phone. Design     accommodates wheelchairs, strollers and bikes.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: Author.Why it mattersTesla believes an aggressive production ramp-up of compelling   electric vehicles, along with an expansion of its lineup to   address more of the major transportation markets, will help it in   its mission ""to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable   energy."" By bringing compelling electric vehicles to market,   Tesla is betting it can catalyze manufacturers and consumers to   transition to electric vehicles more rapidly.Tesla Semi represents a key part of this plan. While a   Tesla-branded heavy-duty truck is still too far away for   investors to begin pricing in its potential impact on the   company's business, it's something investors should keep an eye   on -- particularly when it's unveiled in September.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Well, we got a rough timeline for Tesla's semi-truck reveal. We've known that Tesla was working on a semi-truck, as Musk mentioned it in hissecondMaster Plan, but the only real detail there was that the project was in ""the early stages of development.""It's worth noting that Musk mentioned his semi-truck plans alongside his intentions to develop an electric high passenger-density urban vehicle, which we still don't know much about.Musk also came us a timeframe for the Tesla pickup truck-another project that was briefly mention in the Master Plan, Part Deux.

No, Elon Musk Doesn't Really Think Investors Should Sell Tesla and Buy Ford;4/13/2017;"Elon Musk has a message forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) investors: If you don't like the way he's running   the company, maybe you should go buyFord Motor Company(NYSE: F) instead.Here's what he said:@ReutersThis investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is   amazing ...makeArticleAd();- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 12, 2017As you can see, Musk was responding to aReutersarticle from way back in June 2016. What's this about?Tesla's stock price has risen sharply in recent months on     the anticipated popularity of the company's next car, the Model     3 sedan. Image source: Tesla.Hard questions about Tesla's corporate governanceLast June, shortly after Tesla made itsoffer to acquire solar panel maker SolarCity, an investor group sent a letter urging Tesla to add two   independent directors to its board and to separate the roles of   chairman and CEO. The investors also asked Tesla to assign two   independent directors to form a special committee to review   Tesla's agreement to purchase SolarCity and to change Tesla's   corporate governance rules to forbid immediate family members   from serving concurrently on Tesla's board.That's what the original Reuters report was about. There was a   second letter this week, from a group of five institutional   shareholders, urging Tesla to have all of its directors run for   reelection annually.Clearly, Musk is irked. It's not hard to see why: Most of the   proposals in the letter were direct shots at his leadership of   Tesla and at his family. Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, has been a   member ofTesla's boardfor years, and SolarCity founders Peter and Lyndon Rive are   Musk's cousins. SolarCity's CFO, Brad Buss, also joined Tesla's   board after the acquisition.Musk followed up the Ford tweet with another:@ReutersBesides, I already said we'd add more independent members during   SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do   with it.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 12, 2017What is Musk really saying here?With Tesla, you get what you getI think Musk's message is one that we've heard before: If you   don't like the way he runs Tesla, then maybe an investment in   Tesla isn't for you.There was a special meaning in his ironic recommendation of   Ford. Ford, famously, is controlled by its founding family via a   special class of stock with outsized voting power. That has   annoyed corporate governance experts for decades. But the reality   is that in recent times, the Ford family -- via its   representative in senior management, Executive Chairman Bill Ford   -- has been a good steward of the Blue Oval.Of course, there was another meaning in his ironic   recommendation: If you don't like Musk's management of Tesla, and   the huge growth in Tesla's stock price recently, perhaps a more   sedate investment like Ford is more your speed.How Tesla and Ford have performed over the last six months.

Defensives and yield-sensitives did best, with real-estate investment trusts down just 0.2%.Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) got a lift thanks to CEO Elon Musk teasing a September unveiling of a ""Tesla Semi"" and a July release of the Model 3 sedan on Twitter.This puts an end to a tight two-month trading range as the Q1 earnings season kicks off and investors grow concerned about the Trump Administration's shift in focus from tax reform and healthcare legislation (bogged down by gridlock) to foreign policy, where the White House can exercise power more unilaterally.The situation in Syria remains at a low boil amid recriminations with Assad's Russian allies. The standoff with North Korea is heating up, as the Trump Administration puts pressure on China to get Pyongyang under control on reports the despotic nation is preparing another nuclear weapons test.

The company reported earnings of $1.65 per share on revenues $25.6 billion vs. estimates of $1.51 and $24.6 billion respectively.

Tesla Stock Rebounds as Elon Hypes EV Semi, Pickup (TSLA);4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk - basically labeled a snake oil salesman by formerGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) vice-chairman and legendary ""car guy"" Bob Lutz - is helping juice his company's stock price Thursday thanks to a series of new product announcements that reinvigorated the hype machine.makeArticleAd();This time, in a series of tweets, he hinted at the unveiling of the ""Tesla Semi"" in September, a Tesla pickup truck in 18 to 24 months, and a new roadster convertible.

Musk hinted that the Model 3 would be unveiled in July.Never mind problems, as outlined by Lutz, including a massive cash burn rate, constant need for capital raises and equity dilution and intensifying competitive pressures (GM's own Chevy Bolt, for instance).

And valuations are eye-watering: Tesla's market capitalization hit $51.2 billion earlier this week, eclipsing GM's $51.1 billion andFord Motor Company's(NYSE:F) $45.1 billion valuations.Much of the rise in Tesla stock has been driven by the allaying of capital raising fears after China'sTencent Holdings(OTCMKTS:TCEHY), owner of Chinese social network WeChat, acquired a 5% stake in the company. Also playing a role has been a recent Piper Jaffray analyst note assigning a $368 price target on the admittance that rational arguments by the TSLA bears ""probably won't matter.""Tesla will next report results on May 3 after the close.

Ford Is Dividends and Nothing Else;4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou don't need a chauffeur to be driven insane - owningFord Motor Company(NYSE:F), which has fallen 11% in three months, will get you there.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDown 10% in 12 months, screams bemoaning F stock been commonplace over the past year, compared with the 15% returns delivered by rivalGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM).Meanwhile, 14-year-oldTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) -which just raced passed Ford in market value- has surged 44% year-to-date. It doesn't matter if Tesla makes money. CEO Elon Musk has energized investors with the company's technology and growth potential - something Ford is still struggling to do.Though maybe Wall Street will take Musk'sgrumpy suggestionthat disgruntled investors buy Ford stock instead.F Stock and the DividendAt this point, is there any other reason to own Ford than for its strong payout?7 High-Yield Stocks That Could Wreck Your RetirementAdmittedly, I've been astrong supporterof the Detroit-based automaker, recommending its shares on multiple occasions this year. Theso-called Trump tradeand its associated pro-American policies was a major catalyst. But Ford continues to drive in reverse. F shares closed Tuesday at $11.28 - just shy of its 52-week low of $11.07.And as F stock falls, the dividend yield grows.Indeed, Ford currently yields 5.3%, versus just 2% for theS&P 500index. And while a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 7 is dirt-cheap (compared to 18 for the S&P 500), it's certainly cheap for a reason. Fiscal 2017 consensus estimates of $1.59 per share is projected to decline 9.6% year over year. And based on fiscal 2018 estimates of $1.67, this would still mark a more than 5% decline from 2016.The reason for the slowing earning growth? Besides the fact that there are signs that the North American new-vehicle market has plateaued, automakers are notoriously challenged when it comes to profit margins. In the case of Ford, even if the company sells near-record levels for the next couple of quarters, large discounts will continue to chip away at its bottom line. To its credit, the company has recognized its struggles and its working to improve the model.Technology improvements and a march toward driverless vehicles is a good start. But it's difficult to expect Ford to leapfrog Tesla and tech powers likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google in that regard.What's Next for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock? $400 ... Or $200?That's to say nothing about the advances has already made in that arena. Uber's ride-hailing advances has already catapulted its valuation north of $60 billion, compared to $45 billion for Ford, which has seen its market cap reduced by $7 billion since March.Bottom Line for Ford StockLike its corporate slogan, ""Built Ford Tough,"" owning F stock requires nerves of steel. Although CEO Mark Fields has begun to focus on automotive technologies to drive growth into the 21st century, there's no evidence that Ford will get out of neutral.As such, the strong dividend yield - once a badge of pride and consistency - will soon resemble a scar from a dwindling stock price.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Best Way to Trade United Continental (UAL) Stock NowReport: Apple Inc.

What’s Next for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock? $400 … Or $200?;4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) investors have to be elated with the performance of shares last month - they put out a roughly 11% gain in March compared to a nearly flatS&P 500. TSLA stock has tacked on another 7% so far in April, even with sluggish trading that has it slightly off its fresh all-time highs.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn April 4, the Tesla stock price reached above $300 for the first time since its initial public offering in June 2010. Tesla's market cap has gotten so frothy that I recentlywonderedwhetherFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) could, or would, buy the maker of electric vehicles.Like the Tesla Model S and Model X, it feels like Tesla stock can go only so far before it runs out of gas … no pun intended. But for all its momentum, it's worth exploring the idea of $400 as a next stop, as much as it is $200.Let's look at what would have to happen to hit either target, and which seems likelier.Scenario #1: TSLA Stock Goes to $400Tesla has been rising in 2017 in anticipation of the Model 3 - a relatively inexpensive electric vehicle that will bring more car buyers to Tesla - hitting the car market.10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideAlthough the starting price for a Model 3 is $35,000, San Diego data expert Ben Sullins suggests most of the 400,000-plus reservation holders will likely pay between$45,000-$55,000for their vehicles once you add options most drivers want including an upgraded battery that gets a 300-mile range instead of the standard 215.Not only is the average price of the Model 3 expected to be higher than $42,000 - the number CEO Elon Musktweetedin April 2016 - but the average price of the Model S is likely to be as high as $90,000.If you own TSLA stock, this is a good news/bad news kind of situation.The good news? Revenue will be higher than anticipated providing a greater possibility that the Model 3 will ultimately make money. The bad news … I'll cover in my discussion about Tesla stock and a $200 scenario below.For $400 to be a possibility, its current stock price has to make sense, because if it doesn't, a drop to $200 becomes more likely than rising to $400. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas recently discussedwhy he believes Tesla stock deserves a $300 share price:""The sooner investors view Tesla as a transportation/infrastructure company rather than as just a car company. A significant portion of our $305 price target can be accounted for by the value of Tesla Mobility, an on-demand and highly automated transportation service we anticipate to be launched at low volume in 2018. Our DCF valuation of the core automotive business is $233.""Of the 16 analysts with 12-month price targets, the high is $375, the low is $155 and the median price target is $245. From this perspective, it's clear that many analysts don't view Tesla in the way that Jonas does.I've always been a fan of Tesla and CEO Elon Musk and do think it's a stock most investors 45 and youngershould consider for their retirement portfolio. But I could see why some analysts see a darker future.Scenario #2: TSLA Stock Drops to $200Question:How many vehicles has Tesla delivered in the past five years?Answer:183,000.Question:How much money has Tesla made the past five years?Answer:Zero. It has lost$2.8 billion, hence the need for additional debt and equity raises.Can you see where I'm going with this?Tesla makes no money, is on the hook to deliver 400,000 Model 3s in the next couple of years, yet has managed to deliver an average of just 1,088 vehicles per week over the past five years.Elon Musk says Tesla will produce 10,000 Model 3s by 2018. How does it expect to get to this number when it's never produced more than one-tenth of that in an average week?That right there is the million-dollar question, and a big reason why some analysts are very wary about its current share price.Don't Buy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Because of the NFL, But ...""Tesla's overall customer experience - which we believe is not strong today - and could be further pressured as the company migrates to selling to a more mass-market consumer,"" a Bernstein analyst recentlywrotein a note to investors. ""A poor ramp and customer experience on Model 3 could not only impact Tesla's near-term financials, but undermine the franchise longer-term.""The analyst is saying, ""Ford sold 235,000 vehicles in the U.S. in March; Tesla produced less than that over five years. Ford's made $30.8 billion over the past five years; Tesla's lost billions… and it could get worse.""Ford stock is valued at 0.3 times sales while Tesla's P/S ratio is 20 times that. When you look it from this perspective, it's hard to get excited about a $400 share price.It's especially true when you consider how much pressure the company's facing with the launch of the Model 3. If the Model 3 doesn't get the same kind of reviews from consumer product testing groups as the Model S gets, Tesla shareholders will look back on $300 as the price at which they should have sold.Bottom Line on TeslaAs I said in March, I think TSLA stock could hit$500by this time in 2018 on its way to $1,000, but only if the Model 3 is a success. I think it will be.As such, I think bulls can get excited. A $400 price target is much likelier than $200.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceReport: Apple Inc.

Zacks Market Edge Highlights: Snapchat, Facebook, Tesla and Alphabet;4/13/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 13, 2017 - Zacks Market Edge is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: (https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/256204/do-millennials-care-about-stocks)Do Millennials Care About Stocks?Welcome to Episode #77 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Ryan McQueeney, a Zacks Editor and also co-host of the weekly Friday Finish Line podcast with Maddy Johnson, and Parth Panchal, a Zacks intern and finance major at Loyola of Chicago, to discuss Millennials and investing.There's a myth that Millennials are all broke, living in their parents' basements, and have so much college debt it prohibits them from doing things, like investing some spare cash in the stock market.But a host of apps like Robinhood, which makes it nearly free for Millennials to trade, appear to be changing that.Do Millennials Care About Stocks?Tracey asked Ryan and Parth, two Millennials who, yes, also have an interest in finance so they are slightly biased, just what they and their friends invest in.Yes, they are buying stocks. Yes, even the history major, non-finance Millennials are interested. No, they're not buying ETFs.They like stocks that are highly volatile and have room to the upside such as the social media stocks or the biotechs.They also invest in what they know.As Parth said, ""Millennials like to have something in their hands"" so that means when they invest, they like to know, and most likely, love, the company they are buying. They are emotional investors.It's not surprising, then, that companies that feature prominently in Millennials lives are also among the more popular stocks.What Are Millennials Buying?1. The Snapchat IPO (NYSE:SNAP-Free Report) was big among the younger Millennials. They are the original users of the product so they know it inside and out.2. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) skews older but Millennials grew up using it. They cannot imagine a world without it so they also like the stock.3. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) is another popular stock, not because they can afford to buy one of the cars, but because they like to think they can in the future. They like to buy stock in companies they believe in.4. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) owns one of the most popular brands in the world, YouTube, but Millennial investors aren't really buying the stock. Why not? Tracey asked Parth and Ryan why Alphabet is left out in the cold.Where Do Millennials Get Their News?Millennials have short attention spans. They like to read headlines. But Millennial traders still need to get their financial news somewhere.Tracey was surprised to find out the top source of financial news for Millennials. You won't believe it either. Tune in!What other issues are on the minds of Millennials about stocks and investing?Find out the answer to this and more on this week's podcast.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017makeArticleAd();In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Tesla;4/13/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 13, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Ride Tesla (TSLA) to $450 and Beyond!I am calling forTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) to reach $450 within a year from now. That is not a typo, it is fully $125 ahead of the highest price target on the street. Dougherty's Charlie Anderson put a price target of $375 on the stock back on 2/23/17 when he reiterated his buy rating.My call for such a big move in the stock comes from a solid foundation. The most important part of the foundation is the reason investors put their money into a stock - they expect the value of the company to rise.There are dozens upon dozens of ways to value a company. When you boil it down there are two basic methods… growth or value. If you are a value investor you can probably stop right here as you focus on the past performance and want to see some sort of ""distress"" from which an investment can come back from.Is Growth Enough?Lately we have seen a few analysts talk about TSLA and do so in some rather strange terms. Last week we had the Barclays analyst who has been bearish on the stock for year reiterate a sell rating and a $165 price target. The report talked about a red pill / blue pill scenario in which you either except the idea of ""valuations"" or you live in a world where infinite growth is possible. The analyst noted that ""we don't think 1Q EPS will matter, and while Model 3 hype is baked in, it could drive another leg up.""When you have one of the most bearish analysts in the name suggesting another leg up will come with earnings you have to wonder how much more the bears can withstand. The answer is a lot.Short InterestTSLA has a lot of ""naysayers"" and it is not something new. I was looking at the short interest as reported on the NASDAQ site and then compared it to the stock price. I charted the shares sold short and the price of TSLA at the close on the corresponding day.As the share price moved higher from November 1 through the end of January the shorts were hammered, but they added to their positions.The first meaningful decrease in the short position happened in mid February. It took the 1Q delivery numbers for TSLA to send the stock over $300 per share, but if you have been looking at social media at all, you have to get the feeling that the shorts are now pressing their bets.ValuationsNo earnings for TSLA means that we can't really value them on trailing or forward multiple. GM and F both have some paltry numbers in terms of earnings multiples especially when looking at the industry average.But the market is kind of funny when it comes to how it looks at growth. It really likes company's that grow revenue and earnings.Seems that this year is going to be pretty good for TSLA and the other two… well not so much. Next year looks like earnings will take a big step forward for TSLA while there is going to be a broader move higher according the analyst reports.Recent Attack on the BoardI giggled a little when I saw a recent article that talked about how investors want more board members with fewer ties to Elon Musk. I know it is not everyday that the CEO has his brother on the board, so I get that argument, but it really starts and stops there.Whenever there is talk about increased corporate governance, we always hear about the steps that Cal (PERS) and Cal State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) are taking. Yes, these are big investment funds and you would think they would be looking to support the companies in their own back yard - but you would be wrong. Like any investor, they don't care too much about the location of a company, they care about the returns they get from it. Yet, those names popped up in recent discussion.I took at look to see where this big time investors ranked in terms of TSLA shareholders. I scrolled through 3 screens find Cal PERS which owned 308K (a decrease of 8.6K shares from the last report) shares and STRS which had 259K shares ( a nearly 7K decrease from the last report).Seems they have a very small position to get this much press about the board. Their position seems tiny compared to that of Fidelity at 22M shares or T Rowe Price at 11M shares or even the recent investment by Tencent of 8M shares.The Board is Elon Musk… and for good reason. He is the biggest shareholder and get this, he is buying not selling!According to Finviz, Musk holds about 33.6M shares, making him the single largest shareholder by a wide margin. Musk recently added to his position in a secondary offering, buying $25M worth of stock at $262.But the question remains, will there be a new board member? Could this whole thing be a scheme from Musk himself to make it appear as though an investor wants some more independent representation on the board only to have an announcement all lined up? That would be very unlike Musk, or would it?Tsunami of HurtI have a history with this stock… I first recommended it to investors of Zacks Home Run Investor back in 2013 when it was trading around $38. I talked about thestock in a videoshortly before it was added to the service. The concept was that there was going to be a huge increase in reported revenue and investors were about to see some ""sticker shock"" albeit, the good kind.Not long before that video was shot, Elon Musk warned investors that ""tsunami of hurt"" was in store for those who were short… and believe me, there were plenty of them. One year after that warning shares were up more than 400%.Doomed To Repeat ItBob Lutz said that those that those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Well at least I think he did. OK, let's put it this way, it is a common saying and Bob probably said it at one point. What he did say on CNBC on 4/12/17 was that TSLA was ""doomed.""So let me lay it out for Bob and some other bears. A new model, that when made available for pre order saw more than 100K in the first 48 hours, is going to be delivered this year. About a year ago Musk noted that there are over 400K orders.The demand is real… and we could get more color on that in the next earnings release.There could be another ""series"" of announcements from Musk who has been called a ""Svengali of the stock market."" The shorts are feeling the pain, but seemingly continue to reload as their thesis of a crazy valuation continues to carry the day.Right now the stock is around $300 - but if Musk's warnings are anything like before, a run to $450 and beyond could only be the beginning.Don't Forget to Watch This Video from Dave   Bartosiak: Tesla Success Hinges On Model 3Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside?Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

Tesla (TSLA) Stock Slumps as Investors Question Musk's Ties to Board;4/12/2017;"Shares of Tesla Motors Corp.TSLAclosed more than 3.8% lower on Wednesday after a group of investors urged the company to add new independent directors to its board that do not have any prior ties to Elon Musk.In aletterpenned by representatives from several major Tesla investor groups, the corporate governance of the Silicon Valley-based electric carmaker was called into question.""We expect that as companies make the transition to publicly traded status, the governance structures and practices in place at the time of the IPO will evolve to align with the company's changing strategy,"" the note said. ""However, Tesla's seven-member board is largely unchanged from its pre-IPO days. In fact, only one of the current directors has been appointed since the IPO in 2010.""The group suggested that the board appoint two new directors that have no prior ""personal or professional relationships"" with Elon Musk, and it also called on the directors to hold staggered annual elections for the board.As mentioned in the letter, several of Tesla's directors were brought on board many years ago and have previously worked with Musk in some way.For example, Tesla's board currently includes Elon's brother Kimbal Musk, as well as Brad Buss, the former chief financial officer of SolarCity. Elon Musk served on the SolarCity board for several years before Tesla purchased the solar energy company last year.Elon Musk, never afraid to stick up for his company, took to Twitter to not only defend Tesla, but also promise that new members of the board were coming:@ReutersThis investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 12, 2017@ReutersBesides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 12, 2017News of the letter, which was dated on Monday, broke the same day of the release of a new study suggesting that Tesla's Model S is one of the hottest used cars on the pre-owned market.According to Autolist.com'sdata, used Model S cars tend to sell about 5% faster than their peer group average. The study also described the Model S as being in ""a league of its own"" for sale prices compared to listing price expectations. In short, used Model S vehicles are selling quicker, and for more money, than their industry rivals.And it's exactly these types of results that keep many investors confident in the leadership of Elon Musk. Tesla has shown remarkable growth over the past several years, and the company consistently delivers quality cars.Sure, there are still plenty of question marks surrounding the carmaker's debt load, but I'm not sure it is time to start turning on Musk quite yet.Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside?Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

Why My Son Just Had to Buy Tesla Stock;4/12/2017;"I started investing with my two boys when they were just five-   and seven-years-old. This gave them about a 30 year advantage   over their dad of buying their first stock. Along the way, we've   learned some lessons of long-term investing and seen some pretty   great returns as well.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) was one of the stocks that my kids bought before I   owned any shares of the electric vehicle maker. They thought the   technology was cool, Elon Musk was as talented as Iron Man, and   they kept seeing more and more Tesla's on the road.Let's look at their investing thesis and how it's played   out.""Dad, Tesla cars are really cool.""Tesla is a tech company that just happens to make cars. The   company's ability to innovate has propelled its popularity and   fueled demand of its vehicles. My boys have had some kind of   electronic device in their hands since before they could read, so   having a car that's described as anapp on four wheelswas a technology they embraced without question.The ability forover-the-air updateswas a revolutionary step forward in the auto industry. It has   allowed the company to provide customers new features, after   they've brought their car home,avoiding expensive recalls.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.comMy kids love the fact Tesla cars don't use gas, they make no   noise, have two trunks, have a huge display for navigation and   feature settings, and areridiculously fast. Furthermore, Tesla has been constantlyupgradingits cars more like a software company than a car company, making   it even harder for the incumbent competitors to catch up.Recently, Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, has said the company ""will   never stop innovating,"" and will providemajor upgradesevery 12 to 18 months. Tesla's proven track record of innovation   by itself is a great reason to invest in this company, but   there's more to like about Tesla.""Dad, Elon Musk is the real-life Tony Stark.""It's true. Tony Stark, the fictitious eccentric billionaire,   CEO, and Iron Man inventor wasmodeled after Elon Musk. Looking at Musk's resume, it's no surprise that my boys think   of Tesla's CEO as Tony Stark.Founded Zip2, sold to CompaqCo-founded x.com, became Paypal, sold to EbayFounded SpaceXBailed out Tesla, became CEOHelped start Solarcity, became ChairmanElon Musk is a visionary leader, inspiring others to achieve   the unimaginable. In the early days of Tesla, Elon Musk published   a not-so-secretmaster plan, and with the launch of the Tesla Model 3 the company will have   accomplished those amazing goals in a little more than a decade.   Once that checklist was close to complete, Musk published hismaster plan part duex, which includes innovations such as integrated   solar-roof-with-battery, self-driving cars, and a ride hailing   service to allow Tesla owners to make money with their vehicle   when they are not using it.While being visionary makes for great headlines, it's nothing   without being able to bring the ideas to reality. Elon Musk does   this with his own confident style, whilelaughingat the competition. The Teslacharging networkand thegigafactoryare two examples of never-before-accomplished feats.""Dad, there'sanotherTesla""Tesla's constantly improving itsproduct performanceand its ever growingcharging network. The company'saward winningcars drive increasing demand for its innovative products. The   Tesla brand and its cars are becoming so popular that the   not-yet-released model 3 has a waiting list of373,000 customersthat put down $1,000 to reserve a car they've never driven.Recently the companydoubled downon its efforts to ramp manufacturing capacity to deliver 500,000   vehicles per year by 2018. In the most recent quarter, the   company made another step in that progression and delivered arecord numberof cars.While Tesla is growing fast, it's important to put this in   perspective in terms of the company's valuation. Currently   Tesla's market capitalization is $49 billion, $5 billion more   thanFord, but Ford sold over 87 times more cars than Tesla in   2016, and the electric-car-solar-panel-installation company   is still not consistently profitable. Tesla bears would point out   that the model Sgrowth is slowing, the company's infrastructure growth will require additionalcapital, the SolarCity acquisition could be adrag on the bottom line, and often Teslafails to meet delivery expectations.""I don't care what you say Dad, I'm buyingTesla stock""My kids first invested in Tesla in 2013 when the stock was   under $100. At the time, I thought Tesla was overpriced, and I   wasn't theonly one. When the kids' next chance to buy stocks came around in 2014,   the stock had risen to over $200. In the meantime, my older son   had the opportunity to drive a Model S and was blown away, which   is why he was so adamant about buying more shares. Both purchases   have beaten the market, and the 2013 buy has more than tripled   the market returns, but the volatility has been tremendous.TSLAdata byYChartsWould I let my kids buy more? It's likely my older son   wouldn't give me a choice, but that's OK because he is adding to   a small position in a diversified portfolio of more than 20   stocks, and has a really long term perspective. Elon Musk talked   about the stock being forlong-terminvestors only: ""So I'd say, Tesla is a very good investment for   the long term, but it's impossible to say what it is in the short   term.""The most important lesson my kids have learned with this   investment is patience. After all, Tesla is changing the   world, and that takes time.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Dow Loses Support for First Time Since Election Day;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities finished lower in relatively quiet trading on Wednesday. Big picture: Stocks continue in their listless, ultra-tight, two-month consolidation range. But on a purely technical basis, something major did occur: TheDow Jones Industrial Averageclosed below its 50-day moving average, a key technical support level for the first time since November.makeArticleAd();The catalyst for the decline were lingering concerns about the geopolitical outlook (amid hotpots in Syria and North Korea concerning both Russia and China) as well as ongoing reports pooh-poohing the likelihood of action on tax reform before the end of the year.In the end, the Dow lost 0.3%, theS&P 500lost 0.4%, theNasdaq Compositegave back 0.5% and theRussell 2000was 1.3% lower. Treasury bonds were stronger, the dollar was weaker, gold gained 0.3% and oil broke a string of gains to decline 0.5%.Defensive utility and telecom stocks led the way with gains of 0.6% while industrial were the laggards, down 1.3%. Breadth was heavily negative, with decliners outpacing advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of 2.2 to 1. NYSE volume was 86% of the 30-day average.10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio ForeverBlackberry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) gained 16% after being awarded some $814 million in an arbitration settlement withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) concerning royalty payments.HP Inc(NYSE:HPQ) gained 2.7% on an upgrade to buy from analysts at Citigroup noting PC shipments data are better than expected as the company gains market share. Also helping is a mix shift toward higher margin gaming PCs. On the downside,Tractor Supply Company(NASDAQ:TSCO) fell 8.3% on a negative first-quarter earnings preannouncement.On the geopolitical front, U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson met with Russian officials who agreed a U.N. probe into a recent chemical weapons attack in Syria was necessary. Regarding North Korea, Chinese President Xi reportedly told President Trump in a phone call that there should be a peaceful solution to the problem as Chinese officials warn Pyongyang against conducting another nuclear weapons test.As a reminder, Trump has been lobbying Beijing hard for support in the matter, threatening trade sanctions. North Korea is expected to conduct another long-range missile test on Thursday.Here at home, Trump in an interview said he would prefer to act on healthcare reform legislation first before tackling taxes - despite the fact a big push on the matter failed in the House of Representatives after pushback from conservative Republicans. Trump told Fox Business that healthcare reform could potentially free up hundreds of millions of dollars that could be used to offset the cost of tax cuts.In a separate interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said the U.S. dollar was ""too strong,"" said he preferred interest rates staying low, and said he might reappoint Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen - despite his criticisms of her on the campaign trail - after sitting down and talking with her in the Oval Office. Oh, to be a fly on the wall during that conversation.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won't Hit $1000 Like ThisThe so-called ""reflation"" trade looks vulnerable here on a lack of legislative progress by Trump with bank stocks in particular looking vulnerable.

General Electric Company (GE) Needs to Boot Jeff Immelt;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite having once served on an economic board for President Obama,General Electric Company(NYSE:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt is a lifelong Republican. GE stockshouldbe the perfect stock for the Trump era. It is a U.S.-centric industrial manufacturer employing thousands of American workers for good wages.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)With its deal to combine its oilfield operations with those ofBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI), it's even big in the oilpatch.However, GE stock under Immelt is no place to invest if you want to get rich. Since the bottom of the post-crash market in 2009, GE's performance has barely kept pace with that of theS&P 500. Over the last year, while the average S&P stock is up 15%, GE is down by 2%.The best reason to buy the stock is the dividend, 24 cents per share, a yield of 3.2%. Most years, like last year, it can cover that dividend with earnings.Promises, PromisesImmelt is a veteran politician who has been looking to the future for years without delivering one.Smart money is no longer listening.  Yet Immelt will go down in business history as a great salesman, because like an errant husband, each promise seems to land on someone who wants to believe it.10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio ForeverBut the goals Immelt has trouble meeting are modest. For its first quarter, which GE will report on April 21, analysts are only expecting earnings of 17 cents per share on revenues of $26.36 billion. That is less than half what it earned in the December quarter, on a quarter less revenue.Immelt also keeps moving pieces around his board. Most recently he talked about selling the company's light bulb business, following similar moves bySiemens AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:SIEGY) andKoninklijke Philips NV (ADR)(NYSE:PHG), which figured out years ago that people don't replace long-lasting LED bulbs once they are installed.How much will General Electric book by making this great move? About $500 million. On a market cap of almost $262 billion, that's pocket change.Yet you're always going to find people pounding the table for GE stock, claiming Immelt still has aces up his sleeve. Oil is up, and so the Baker Hughes bet will pay off big. Besides, Immelt might leave after the Baker Hughes deal is done. That will certainly be a catalyst for higher prices.Immelt's exit may be the stock's only hope. Everything he touches turns into tin, and what he lets go turns at least into silver.TakeSynchrony Financial(NYSE:SYF), the credit card unit spun out to shareholders in 2014. Since then, Synchrony is up 43% and GE 13.5%.If you think that sounds good for GE, the S&P 500 is up almost 19% since then.Time to Get Out of GE StockI finally got out of General Electric in January for $31.41 per share. GE opened for trade April 12 at just a hair under $30.Will This Catalyst Put Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock On Steroids?Yet the average rating for GE is still overweight. Half the analysts who follow the stock have it on their buy lists, against just one with the courage to say sell.GE is a big company. It will continue to make big sales. It will keep buying other companies at the margins of its current operations and some of its options will keep looking interesting.But it is time to put a period on the Immelt era. The high-flying entertainment and finance company of Jack Welch has been reduced to a helpless industrial giant, a widows-and-orphans stock that barely manages to earn enough to pay those dividends.This will remain the case until Jeff Immelt is in GE's rear-view mirror. When he is gone I might be interested in GE stock, butonlywhen he is gone.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Ride Tesla To $450 And Beyond!;4/12/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();I am calling forTesla(TSLA) to reach $450 within a year from now.  That is not a typo, it is fully $125 ahead of the highest price target on the street.  Dougherty's Charlie Anderson put a price target of $375 on the stock back on 2/23/17 when he reiterated his buy rating.My call for such a big move in the stock comes from a solid foundation.  The most important part of the foundation is the reason investors put their money into a stock - they expect the value of the company to rise.There are dozens upon dozens of ways to value a company.  When you boil it down there are two basic methods… growth or value.  If you are a value investor you can probably stop right here as you focus on the past performance and want to see some sort of ""distress"" from which an investment can come back from.On the other hand, if you are a growth investor, then I have something that will help your case.  The best type of growth is sequential, and that is just what we expect to see from TSLA over the next year:Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1Is That Growth Enough?Lately we have seen a few analysts talk about TSLA and do so in some rather strange terms.  Last week we had the Barclays analyst who has been bearish on the stock for year reiterate a sell rating and a $165 price target.  The report talked about a red pill / blue pill scenario in which you either except the idea of ""valuations"" or you live in a world where infinite growth is possible.  The analyst noted that ""we don't think 1Q EPS will matter, and while Model 3 hype is baked in, it could drive another leg up.""When you have one of the most bearish analysts in the name suggesting another leg up will come with earnings you have to wonder how much more the bears can withstand.  The answer is a lot.Short InterestTSLA has a lot of ""naysayers"" and it is not something new.  I was looking at the short interest as reported on the NASDAQ site and then compared it to the stock price.  I charted the shares sold short and the price of TSLA at the close on the corresponding day.This chart shows me a rather important part of why I think TSLA goes to $450 and beyond.  As the share price moved higher from November 1 through the end of January the shorts were hammered, but they added to their positions.The first meaningful decrease in the short position happened in mid February. It took the 1Q delivery numbers for TSLA to send the stock over $300 per share, but if you have been looking at social media at all, you have to get the feeling that the shorts are now pressing their bets.ValuationsThe main talking point that the shorts stick to is the valuation of the company.  Let's just address that one head on to see what they are talking about.  I will start with the standard metrics:No earnings for TSLA means that we can't really value them on trailing or forward multiple.  GM and F both have some paltry numbers in terms of earnings multiples especially when looking at the industry average.But the market is kind of funny when it comes to how it looks at growth.  It really likes company's that grow revenue and earnings.  Let's take a look at another chart and then think a bit more about why the valuations are what they are.Seems that this year is going to be pretty good for TSLA and the other two… well not so much.  Next year looks like earnings will take a big step forward for TSLA while there is going to be a broader move higher according the analyst reports.Recent Attack On The BoardI giggled a little when I saw a recent article that talked about how investors want more board members with fewer ties to Elon Musk.  I know it is not everyday that the CEO has his brother on the board, so I get that argument, but it really starts and stops there.Whenever there is talk about increased corporate governance, we always hear about the steps that Cal (PERS) and Cal State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) are taking.  Yes, these are big investment funds and you would think they would be looking to support the companies in their own back yard - but you would be wrong.  Like any investor, they don't care too much about the location of a company, they care about the returns they get from it.  Yet, those names popped up in recent discussion.I took at look to see where this big time investors ranked in terms of TSLA shareholders.  I scrolled through 3 screens find Cal PERS which owned 308K (a decrease of 8.6K shares from the last report) shares and STRS which had 259K shares ( a nearly 7K decrease from the last report).Seems they have a very small position to get this much press about the board.  Their position seems tiny compared to that of Fidelity at 22M shares or T Rowe Price at 11M shares or even the recent investment by Tencent of 8M shares.The Board is Elon Musk… and for good reason.  He is the biggest shareholder and get this, he is buying not selling!According to Finviz, Musk holds about 33.6M shares, making him the single largest shareholder by a wide margin.  Musk recently added to his position in a secondary offering, buying $25M worth of stock at $262.I searched around several sites, and found that few accounted for Musk's huge position.  This site show that insiders own less that 1% which makes you wonder if we have to fact check everything for ourselves.But the question remains, will there be a new board member?  Could this whole thing be a scheme from Musk himself to make it appear as though an investor wants some more independent representation on the board only to have an announcement all lined up?  That would be very unlike Musk, or would it?Tsunami of HurtI have a history with this stock… I first recommended it to investors of Zacks Home Run Investor back in 2013 when it was trading around $38.  I talked about thestock in a videoshortly before it was added to the service. The concept was that there was going to be a huge increase in reported revenue and investors were about to see some ""sticker shock"" albeit, the good kind.Not long before that video was shot, Elon Musk warned investors that ""tsunami of hurt"" was in store for those who were short… and believe me, there were plenty of them.  One year after that warning shares were up more than 400%.More recently there was another warning.  Make that two warnings.  First was the April 3 tweet of  ""Stormy weather in Shortville …"" and then a direct response shown here:I mention this because after that first report with big sales numbers there was a series of announcements that lifted the stock from $40 to $90 then to $120 and before long we were testing $200 at $190 a share before a pull back sent prices back below $130.  This would be that last time the stock traded below $130.Doomed To Repeat ItBob Lutz said that those that those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  Well at least I think he did.  OK, let's put it this way, it is a common saying and Bob probably said it at one point.  What he did say on CNBC on 4/12/17 was that TSLA was ""doomed.""So let me lay it out for Bob and some other bears.  A new model, that when made available for pre order saw more than 100K in the first 48 hours, is going to be delivered this year.  About a year ago Musk noted that there are over 400K orders.The demand is real… and we could get more color on that in the next earnings release.There could be another ""series"" of announcements from Musk who has been called a ""Svengali of the stock market."" The shorts are feeling the pain, but seemingly continue to reload as their thesis of a crazy valuation continues to carry the day.Right now the stock is around $300 - but if Musk's warnings are anything like before, a run to $450 and beyond could only be the beginning.Don't Forget to Watch This Video from Dave Bartosiak: Tesla Success Hinges On Model 3Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside?Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

Despite Record Highs, Tesla Shorts Aren't Backing Off Much;4/12/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is arguably the most prominent battleground stock,   and it's only becoming more polarizing as the company continues   to march toward Model 3 production. You either love Tesla or you   hate Tesla, with little room in between.Shares are up over 40% year to date, tapping fresh all-time   highs last week. Tesla reported strong first-quarter deliveries   of25,000 vehiclesat the beginning of April, with a rising mix of Model X SUVs,   which helped drive shares higher at the start of the month.   Still, bearish short-sellers don't appear to be backing off quite   yet, despite sustained losses.Stormy weather in Shortville ...makeArticleAd();- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 3, 2017Short interest remains incredibly highNasdaq has just released its official short interest numbers   for the end of March, and the number of shares held short   actually climbed higher compared to the beginning of March,   although it was slightly higher a couple months ago.Settlement DateShort InterestAverage Daily Share VolumeDays to CoverMarch 31, 201731.35 million5.2 million6March 15, 201731.07 million4.05 million7.7Feb. 28, 201731.01 million8.5 million3.6Feb. 15, 201732.2 million4.65 million6.9Jan. 31, 201734.35 million4.64 million7.4Jan. 13, 201735.04 million5.54 million6.3Data source: Nasdaq.It's worth pointing out that a March 31 settlement date   corresponds to a trade date of March 28, which was about a week   before the jump after the delivery announcement.Business Insiderpoints out that Tesla short-sellers have already collectively   lost billions of dollars, according to data from financial   analytics specialist S3 Partners, which tracks short data in more   granular detail than what the exchange discloses. Short interest   is an incredible 38% of float right now.Catch-22There are a lot of moving parts with Tesla's current short   situation.While shorts commonly (and justifiably) cite insane valuation   levels, shorting a stock basedsolelyon valuation can be a risky endeavor and far from a sure bet.   Even if Tesla shares are overvalued, whether or not the market   corrects itself is another matter altogether. As the old saying   goes: ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay   solvent.""Image source: Tesla.Personally, I think it's extremely difficult to make a   relative assessment of overvalued or undervalued since Tesla   lacks comparable peers, even though it's clear that the current   valuation is almost entirely predicated on future potential, at a   level far greater than the average stock.As shares rise, two things happen. Shorts continue to lose   more, and the possibility of a short squeeze increases if a bunch   of them decide to bail. Meanwhile, any further price increases   only stretch the valuation even further, potentially emboldening   bears further. That's something of a catch-22.It's pretty tough to bet against a massive story stock that's   driven almost entirely by investor sentiment, but that hasn't   stopped the bears from trying.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Bet on BP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock After Oil’s Rise;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRising geopolitical turmoil and promises by OPEC to maintain production cuts helped boost oil prices and lift energy stocks across the board. While oil futures declined a few cents Wednesday, oil prices still stand to run should OPEC continue expanding its current agreement.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrSector leaderExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) islooking sharpheading into this month's quarterly earnings report, butBP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) could offer better returns for traders heading into it's own first-quarter earnings event.The energy sector's biggest driver, oil prices, has moved substantially higher in the current market environment. West Texas Intermediate futures were down slightly Wednesday, settling around $53.27 per barrel as of this writing, after oil hit its highest level in a month Tuesday.While rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia in Syria are providing a bit of upside, promises from Saudi Arabia to extend the current OPEC production cuts for another six months at the group's meeting in May has provided most of the ballast.As with Exxon, higher oil prices are good for BP stock, and could help bolster the company's guidance when it enters the earnings confessional on May 2.Analysts are looking for a sharp rise in profits from BP, with expectations set at 41 cents per share compared with earnings of just 17 cents per share in the same quarter last year. Revenue, meanwhile, is seen rising 34.2% to $51.7 billion.Click to EnlargeTechnically speaking, BP stock is having a rough 2017. The shares are down more than 5% so far this year, following a nearly 25% advance in 2016. But BP is looking to get back on track now that oil price appear to be recovering again.After spending March in consolidation mode between $33 and $34, BP has edged back above all of its major short-term moving averages - even pulling its 50-day and 10-day trendlines into a bullish cross. This development could provide extra buying power for BP shares should technical traders see it as a ""buy"" signal.Checking in with sentiment, analysts remain largely on the sidelines when it comes to BP stock. According to Thomson/First Call, seven of the 11 brokerage firms offering up an opinion on BP stock rate the shares a ""hold"" or worse.10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio ForeverFurthermore, the 12-month consensus price target rests at $37.79, less than 7% above BP's close on Tuesday. With oil poised to move higher and take BP stock with it, there is plenty of room for upgrades or price-target increases that could send the stock higher.Options traders, meanwhile, appear to be betting on a rally. Looking out to May BP options, the put/call open interest ratio arrives at 0.60, with bullish calls in control among near-term options activity. There is some concern when it comes to earnings, however, as the 5 May put/call OI ratio rests at an elevated reading of 1.17, with puts outnumbering calls for options most affected by BP's quarterly report.Overall, 5 May implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 4.26%. This places the upper bound at $36.49, while the lower bound rests at $33.51. A pullback to the $33-$34 region would be nothing new for BP stock, as the shares spent the past month sidling in the area.A breakout above $36, however, could be a sign that the recent uptrend is here to stay.2 Trades for BP StockCall Spread:Those traders looking to bet bullish on BP stock might want to consider a May $35/$36 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 50 cents, or $50 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $35.50, while a maximum profit of 50 cents, or $50 per pair of contracts, is possible if BP stock closes at or above $36 when May options expire.Catch the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Falling Knife With Metal GlovesPut Spread:On the other hand, oil prices remained fickle, leading to erratic price action from BP stock. Traders nervous that these gyrations will lead to more sidling activity might consider a May $33 put sell. At last check, this put was bid at 45 cents, or $45 per contract.As with all put sells, traders will keep the premium received for entering the trade as long as BP stock trades above $33 through May expiration. If BP were to trade below $33 prior to expiration, then you could be assigned 100 shares per contract sold at a cost of $33 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017Will This Catalyst Put Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock On Steroids?The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The postBet on BP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock After Oil's Riseappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Buy This Dip in Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) stock has taken a bit of a breather of late. A 50%-plus run after the election pushed BofA to a post-crisis high near $26. But BAC stock has dropped about 11% from those highs.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOf course, valuation concerns have hit the entire financial sector, not just Bank of America.With BAC trading below $23, it's hard not to see the money-center giant as a buying opportunity - especially ahead of the bank's earnings report arriving next week.I'm not surprised that some investors have chosen to take profits after BAC stock's biggest run in years. But I've liked Bank of America stockfor some time now. And from a long-term perspective, there's still more room to run.BAC Stock Remains CheapBofA hasn't been alone in seeing recent weakness. Other financial stocks are down over the past month as well.Goldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) stock has declined almost 9%;Citigroup Inc(NYSE:C) is down 4%-plus. But the decline in BAC stock actually has been the steepest, with BAC down 9.5% over the past month. EvenWells Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC) -still dealing with the ramifications of its fake account scandal- has outperformed Bank of America.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyThe drop has left BAC rather cheap, trading at just 13 times 2017 earnings estimates. And while banking peers are trading at similarly depressed multiples, BofA looks stronger. Citigroup still hasn't fully recovered from the financial crisis, and retains a number of questionable assets on its balance sheet. Goldman's retail effort, Marcus, looks like an early disappointment. Wells Fargo's reputation has taken a major hit - a potential competitive advantage for BofA.BAC andJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) look like the two strongest banks at the moment - yet trade at similar multiples to peers. And with BofA coming off a fourth quarter with a historically low charge-off ratio, BAC stock looks like the safest play in the space among large-cap financials.The Risks Look ManageableOf course, BAC stock isn't a risk-free play. No stock is.Our own Chris Tyler madea prescient call for a bearish tradeon Bank of America stock last month, and near-term trading could be choppy. Earnings seasons for financials begins with JPM's report, and each company's numbers will reverberate across the sector. Investors appear to have ""sold the news"" somewhat relative to rate hikes, and any sign of a pullback from the Fed in terms of raising rates could rattle BofA stock.There's near-term political risk as well. It certainly appears that the recent sell-off in financials was driven at least in part by the failure of the Trump administration's health care bill. That's raised fears that corporate tax reform - a significant potential boost for bank profitability - may not pass Congress.Similarly, a weakened administration may not be able to move on the fiduciary standard, the Volcker rule, and other regulations targeted by the industry.In the case of BofA, however, the potential regulatory impact should be somewhat limited. BofA's Merrill Lynch unit already has adapted to the fiduciary standard. The proprietary trading business long was much smaller, and much less important, than it was for a company like Goldman Sachs orMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS).And again, BAC stock is trading at 13 times earnings; it's not as if investors are pricing in some supercharged, regulatory-driven growth. At current levels, if the economic cycle has a few more years, and if BofA truly has de-risked its loan books, Bank of America stock should continue to rise. Right now, both drivers appear to be intact.Bank of America Stock Is a BuyAll told, BofA looks too cheap after the recent pullback. The risks, both near-term and long-term, are real.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017But Q1 earnings could be a catalyst, given cooperation from the equity markets and low Q4 delinquency rates. Recent economic data supports additional rate hikes this year, with BofA saying each 25 basis point increase adds 5 cents in EPS. That means earnings should strengthen as the year goes on - and Bank of America stock should follow.With the stock pricing in basically zero growth, expectations still are modest, even with the stock still up nearly 40% from pre-election levels. I don't know that I'd expect another 40% by year-end, but there's certainly a good chance that BAC stock can challenge $26 again, at least.The author has no positions in any securities mentioned, but may take a position in BAC stock this week.More From InvestorPlaceUnited States Steel Corporation (X) Stock Sinks on Ore, Leak ConcernsWill This Catalyst Put Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock On Steroids?Catch the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Falling Knife With Metal GlovesThe postBuy This Dip in Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

This Is The Future Of Energy. Here’s How To Invest…;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecently my team and I have been telling my readers about a quiet revolution that's taking place thanks to eccentric billionaire Elon Musk and his band of scientists atTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).makeArticleAd();You see, for years they've been working feverishly at their lab in Fremont, California on a battery that could provide enough energy to power a house.Last year, news came along that they'd finally broken through.And now, for the first time in decades, we could see the entire utility sector turned on its head as a result - leading to massive gains for early investors.As you can see, Tesla's battery storage device looks nothing like your old-fashioned AA battery.It's a sleek, compact unit that you can mount on the wall in your garage. One single, stand-alone unit delivers enough power to take an entire home completely off the grid. Simply charge it with a solar panel, windmill or any other power source, and you've got all the energy you need.Thanks to Tesla, the world is about to see that an energy sea-change has been quietly unfolding before their eyes for several years now.And many of the world's greatest investors are quickly staking their claims in this new technology.Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel - the first outside investor inFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)- has poured in millions of dollars of his own money. (As one of the early supporters of Donald Trump's presidential run, it's rumored Thiel has the President Trump's ear, too.)Bill Gates has made not one, but three big investments. And Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A,BRK.B) has jumped in as well.But it's not just the brilliance of this energy storage device that makes it an appealing investment space.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?It's the timing.You see, this device is going to enter the market at a time when demand for a product like this has never been higher.In fact, there are three intriguing factors making this technology particularly promising…1. U.S. Political SupportBecause of geo-politics and concerns about pollution, governments are falling over themselves to get more energy storage systems in place.Take California, for instance. That one single state could cause every public company in the energy storage industry to soar triple-digits, thanks to new legislation, mandating that its largest utilities have enough energy storage capacity to provide electrical support for 1 million homes.That's the equivalent of building a dam's worth of infrastructure. And they want it in place by 2020.Keep in mind: when the governments mandate something, it isn't simply a request. It's the law. If utilities don't comply, they'll be punished. That's why California's largest utilities - from Con Edison to Pacific Gas and Electric - are already jumping on this.Massachusetts is following California's lead. It just launched a $10 million initiative and aims to be a national leader in energy storage.And New York, Texas, Oregon, Arizona and other states are making similar moves.2. Global Political SupportGermany is dedicating $56 million a year specifically for energy storage. Japan is setting aside $700 million, aiming to be the ""world leader"" in energy storage. And China is jumping in with both feet. Its energy storage market is projected to quadruple over the next decade.The driving factor behind this global push for energy storage is simple. Reducing pollution.""If China doubles its energy production over the next two decades,"" billionaire Peter Thiel points out, ""it will also double its air pollution. If every one of India's hundreds of millions of households were to live the way Americans already do - using only today's tools - the result would be environmentally catastrophic. Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not riches.""In fact, the International Energy Agency has called on world leaders to spend a combined $380 billion on energy storage by 2050.3. Public SupportBut political support is only half the story. The energy storage revolution is really being driven by the public at large, and it all funnels down to one thing.Freedom.For some people, it's freedom from utility companies. They don't like the fact that utilities are essentially a monopoly and can raise their rates at a whim. With an energy storage system, you wouldn't have to worry about this.Others want to ""get out from under big brother,"" as one energy storage user told USA Today.He and others like him don't trust that the government won't try to control their energy consumption simply because they're running their A/C longer than a bureaucrat deems proper.Bottom line:The energy revolution is coming. And Tesla's battery storage device is just part of the story.10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideNow here's the thing… I'm not recommending you invest in Tesla. I've identifiedthree little-known stocksthat could soar 10 times higher by 2020 - and they'll do it by riding Tesla's coattails.Sure, Tesla is likely to see some nice long-term gains thanks to this revolution. But the lion's share of the gains will be found in smaller, lesser-known companies that are making this technology a reality.Make no mistake: Opportunities like this don't come around very often. And when the public catches on to this revolution, the big gains will have already been made.You can click here to view my full report.StreetAuthority's mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased - and most of all, profitable - investing ideas.

Heck, if you bought CHK stock at the beginning of 2016, you made 56% on the year, more than four times theS&P 500.makeArticleAd();Source:Philadelphia 76ers Via FlickrCHK stock hasn't traded below $5 on a consistent basis since July 2016. Suddenly, it has become the poster child for low volatility. Trading as high as $30 less than three years ago, Chesapeake Energy longs probably feel a bottom is in - and who could blame them?CHK stock appears ready to crack double digits once energy prices push higher or other good news appears as a catalyst to get it moving.InvestorPlacecontributor Vince Martin feels an improving economy should help with that.""The economy is improving, which generally drives energy prices higher,""Martin recently wrote. ""President Trump's expressed desire for higher coal production should have less practical impact than he expects, as utilities already have switched to natural gas - and aren't switching back. I don't know that I expect $70 oil and $4 natural gas again - but there is room for higher energy prices in the current economic climate.""10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017It's hard to argue with economics or Martin's assessment.So CHK Stock Is a Winner?There's a caveat.Rising energy prices float all boats; investors still need to evaluate the risk of buying CHK stock (instead of buying another oil and gas stock) and its$9.9 billionin long-term debt. Anytime a company's outstanding loans are greater than its market cap, you're most certainly playing with fire.Having said all this, let me just say that I'm by no means an expert when it comes to oil and gas stocks. I did, however,warn investorsback in 2011 when CHK stock was trading above $30 that it was going nowhere fast and to steer clear of it. Of course, in hindsight, we know what happened.The one thing I've learned from all my years writing about stocks is that you get pretty good at knowing your strengths - and weaknesses. For me, energy stocks are my kryptonite. Just reading the word BBOe gets me tied up in knots.I'm sure some investors have figured out down to the penny how much Chesapeake Energy's 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent are worth. Maybe $40, $50, $60, all the way up to $100 per barrel - and I'm sure their calculation suggests CHK stock's intrinsic value is worth far more than $6 per share.Good on them.For the rest of us left to our own devices it's important that we carefully evaluate the risk of buying CHK stock, given that it could still go bankrupt.If you believe that energy prices will rise from their current levels around $53 to, say, $70, a lot of businesses will benefit from this increase, not just Chesapeake Energy. And the other side of this argument is … what if oil pricesdon'trise?Goldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS)sees oil pricesstabilizing over the long term, settling in the mid-$50s.Either way, why wouldn't you just buy an oil-related exchange-traded fund to minimize your risk that CHK isn't the one?Chesapeake Energy's Financial SituationNow, let's get back to Chesapeake Energy potentially going bankrupt.GuruFocus.com says Chesapeake Energy's Altman Z-Score is currently -2.25. Anything less than 1.81 suggests a company faces the real possibility of bankruptcy within the next two years. Of course, that can change dramatically by making money. Analysts estimate that CHK will make 74 cents and $1.18 in fiscal 2017 and 2018 respectively.I did a quick Altman Z-Score calculation of my own which appears below.Current Altman Z-Score CalculationCHKWorking Capital-1,506,000,000 Total Assets 13,028,000,000 Retained Earnings -17,603,000,000 EBITDA -3,064,000,000 Market Cap 5,630,000,000 Total Liabilities 14,488,000,000 Net Sales 7,872,000,000-1.97Source: Morningstar.com FinancialsI get -1.97 which is slightly better than GuruFocus.com. If you make the EBITDA loss of $3.06 billion, positive, the Altman Z-Score becomes -0.42, still in bankruptcy territory but clearly much better. The improved earnings situation would then increase the value of its assets, which would push the number closer to positive territory.So, yes, it's very possible that two years of increased earnings will significantly reduce the risk of bankruptcy.3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Still a Top BuyMy brand of investing is simple. Follow Warren Buffett's lead. Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1.Back in 2011, I suggestedEOG Resources Inc(NYSE:EOG) provided less risk to investors than CHK. Clearly, that hasn't changed.At $6, CHK stock is still a huge risk.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWill This Catalyst Put Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock On Steroids?The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The postChesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Is Still a HUGE Risk at $6appeared first onInvestorPlace."

How to Wrangle Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Profits;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs recent stock weakness inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) offering investors an early warning to make an exit? Or is this a bullish opportunity to buy? Today, we'll look at the current setup in AMD stock, then present a strategy that will provide profits without piling on the risk.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt has been just more than a month since I last penned amostly optimistic take and strategy on AMD. Shares of Advanced Micro are mostly unchanged for the period, but beneath the surface, there has been a good deal of price volatility to ponder.The most striking catalyst during this period was a surprising initiation from Goldman Sachs. Last week, the firm slapped AMD stockwith a ""sell"" rating and $11 price targetroughly 20% below the prior night's close. The bearish coverage was good enough to send shares more than 6% lower in a single session.Analyst Toshiya Hari did note many improvements at AMD under the stewardship of CEO Lisa Su. In his view, product launches, cost management and deleveraging of the company's balance sheet have all been well-executed. However, given 2016's substantial 300%-plus gain and relatively steep multiple, Hari warned strongly that Advanced Micro Devices was also ""priced for perfection.""Also, analysts expect that an unfavorable price war with bothIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) would occur at Advanced Micro's expense.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyIs it time to listen to Goldman? One could use it as a starting point. However, Goldman's calls - beyond their short-term influence - aren't exactly the gold standard. I'd prefer to look at what others have to say and maintain an open mind.AMD Stock ChartClick to EnlargeAdvanced Micro Devices is far from a momentum play right now - at least in the bullish direction. Stochastics are oversold, and an uptrend line of around six months in duration has been broken.Shares could always snap back aggressively with a bullish earnings reaction. But for now, Goldman's knockdown of AMD stock essentially pulled the rug out from what had been a nicely-developing momentum situation.Maybe Goldman is, as alum and CNBC personality James Cramer suggests, merely""taking away the punchbowl""for AMD - but a company that remains on track to grow its business and capture market share?AMD's chart does more accurately reflect a punchbowl situation. And there's nothing wrong with embracing this type of more technically driven entry into shares.Just don't play Advanced Micro Devices too loosely.How to Trade AMD StockI think Advanced Micro is a buy amid a short-lived corrective move, but I want to better control risk than just a simple stop-loss methodology.Right now, I suggest theMay $15 call/$12 put collar. With shares at $13, the package is priced for $13.20. For the 20-cent cost or additional premium paid over simply owning shares, the investor is fully protected below $12.BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Jumps 18% on License Win Against QualcommTechnically speaking, the collar's insurance makes sense. A low of $12.38 back in early March does appear to be significant in maintaining, while still allowing for a smidgeon of wiggle room down to the $12 put.AMD's next earnings report is scheduled for May 1. In our view, the real cost of this collar is the earnings report, or maybe a product update. Then, there's a significant shift of bullish momentum in shares. Remember, the $15 call is being sold to finance the protective put. So without any adjustments, the call sale does initially cap upside at 12%.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Facebook Inc (FB): It’s Not Too Late to Buy FB Stock;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI confess thatFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) never appealed to me as an investment. I avoid momentum stocks anyway, and I didn't really believe that meaningful revenue would be generated by Mark Zuckerberg & Co. I was dead wrong.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFacebook has become a digital billboard, generating a massive 98% of its revenue from ads, which can be a terrific business. Now,more than 5 million businesses advertise on Facebook.com.As technology improved and the ability to ascertain return on investment became more and more efficient, finding which sources for eyeballs would pay the best became easier. I never thought FB stock would be such a place, but here we are.Not only that, but FB has gotten even better at figuring out how to leverage its users into generating more revenue, and a lot of that is happening via mobile. It makes sense, of course, because the entire world is mobile at this point and emerging markets are moving out of 2G into higher speeds.Thus, FB stock has soared because it really owns the display side of generating digital ad revenue, whileAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns the search side of the business.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017I'm going to do some number-crunching here. I don't want to overwhelm, but you'll see how FB stock price is going up on the backs of some impressive growth as shown in Q4:Daily Active Users (or DAUs): 1.23 billion, geographically well-diversified with the U.S. & Canada at 15%, Europe at 21%, Asia-Pacific coming in at 32%, and the rest of the globe also at 32%.Mobile DAUs: 1.15 billionMonthly Active Users (also known as MAUs): 1.86 billionMobile MAUs: 1.74 billionGrowth in ad revenue for Q4, year-over-year was an astonishing 53% to $8.63 billion.Not only are users growing, but the average revenue per monthly active user (or ARPU) is off the charts for North America, climbing from $9 in Q4 of 2014 to $13.70 in 2015 (more than 50%!) and $19.81 last year, up nearly 50%.Going back to this idea that mobile revenue growth is exploding on the backs of improving mobile technology, mobile revenue in Q4 of 2014 was $2.5 billion. It nearly tripled to $7.2 billion last year.When you look at the entire digital ad spend these days, it is dominated by Facebook and Google.I hate the idea that 98% of a company's revenues comes from one thing. Diversification means everything to me. However, I cannot argue with the fact that FB is the 800-pound gorilla in the space.There are only three things that can upset the apple cart for FB stock, and neither seem like they could ever be permanently damaging. First, it is possible that something else appears that makes Facebook decline in popularity. This seems extremely unlikely at this point in time. Barring some kind of horrendous PR disaster that causes Facebook to implode, I don't take this threat seriously.Second, it is possible that the number of users is being misreported. How FB actually determines the number of users and how active they are is what matters here, and if advertisers ever lose confidence in that data, they could run for the hills. I'm not suggesting that this is the case, but if it were, then there would be trouble.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won't Hit $1000 Like ThisFinally, a severe recession could cripple advertising spending. The thing about this is that it would be temporary. The financial crisis took a toll on companies that relied on ad revenue, but it came back. Facebook's balance sheet is a fortress, so little would be impacted.FB stock trades at 40 times its earnings. And now, I can't say it's unreasonable considering its growth rate.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Still a Top Buy;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) has gotten its groove back. For the year so far, AAPL stock has logged an impressive 22% gain, outpacing other tech heavyweights likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL).makeArticleAd();Heck, Apple's even edging outFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) at the moment.Granted, I'd understand if investors get cautious here. Apple, which sports a massive $743 billion market cap, will have a tough time mustering the buying power to continue its standout gains.There are other concerns, such as the political situation. Might the Trump's Administration hawkishness on trade have an impact, especially in China? Or could a border tax make outsourcing more expensive? And what about the growing restrictions on immigration? A repatriation tax has been baked into AAPL stock, too, but it actually has to happen for Apple to wring any value out of it.These are all legitimate issues, but Apple still has many key advantages that should bolster returns. Today, we'll look at three.There's Still Value in AAPL StockApple stock still remains a decent bargain despite its outstanding run-up YTD. Right now, AAPL trades at just 14 times earnings, versus 21 for growthierAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), but even MSFT trades at 20x. Meanwhile, the average multiple for theS&P 500is roughly 20.Apple has also attracted the attention of some of the world's best value investors, including Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management, andBerkshire Hathaway Inc.'s(NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017Apple certainly has enormous financial resources, which it can use to execute more buybacks or pump up its regular dividend, which right now yields just 1.6%. In talking about the Trump administration's potential for a repatriation tax holiday, realize that likely would go toward a big stock repurchase program or a special dividend, but because it's not consistent cash flow, that would be less likely to go toward raising the regular payout.Still, Apple has a lot of money to work with - roughly $245 billion in cash and investments.The iPhone SupercycleThe fate of AAPL stock is ultimately tied strongest to the iPhone, which still produces 60% of the company's sales.The good news is that the latest model - iPhone 8 is the most likely name - should soak up substantial demand. This is the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, and Apple has made no bones about wanting this one to be a statement.So what might we expect with the iPhone 8?There's a lot of buzz, including the idea that there may be up to three models. Potentialfeaturesinclude wireless charging, advanced biometric features (such as allowing for unlocking using facial recognition), bezel-less screens, water resistance, and new touch ID technology.Growth in ServicesOf course, one of the biggest knocks against AAPL stock is the aforementioned dependence on the iPhone. Even if the iPhone 8 is a global blockbuster, it will be more and more difficult to churn out growth from an increasingly mature and saturated smartphone market - not just here, but in other developed markets and even emerging countries like China.How to Wrangle Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for ProfitsApple has been bolstering its Services division - the App Store, iTunes, storage - to deal with this. The Apple Pay platform could also become a nice revenue booster.While Services accounts for only about 9% of revenues, the business should remain a key growth driver. Based on the analysis from RBC's Amit Daryanani, the segment could reach as much as$50 billion in revenues by 2020. Also, these revenues will likely drive higher margins and be more stable, as many of them are driven by ongoing subscriptions.According to Daryanani: ""We see potential for upside to Apple's current valuation if the company were to continue to increase its mix of higher margin, less cyclical services revenue over time.""Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookas well asOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools & services for employee stock options of pre/post IPO companies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Will This Catalyst Put Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock On Steroids?;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUntil last year, China had beenTesla Inc's(NASDAQ:TSLA) ""White Whale,"" a coveted beast that had repeatedly eluded Elon Musk's otherwise fast-growing company.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut sales in the world's most populous country tripled last year, and could theoretically accelerate even more now that one of China's largest internet entities has bought a 5% stake in TSLA stock.Tencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) paid $1.78 billion for its relatively small stake (it's now the fifth-largest shareholder) in the luxury electric car maker.But the impact on Tesla, and TSLA stock, could be big.Tencent has enough clout to help move the needle for Tesla sales in China, and the timing couldn't be better with Tesla set to launch the Model 3, its first ""affordable"" electric car, later this year.China Next Frontier for TSLA Stock GrowthLast year, Tesla's China revenue topped $1 billion for the first time, accounting for more than 15% of the company's total sales. That's good, but there's plenty of room for improvement. Slow deliveries and a lack of charging stations contributed to a slow 2015 in China; sales fell by about a third that year. Sales bounced back emphatically last year, in part because TSLA added 57 new stores worldwide and 200-plus new supercharger stations. But the Tencent deal should give Tesla a better understanding of the Chinese market, which should help future growth.Investors clearly liked the move, at least initially: Tesla stock jumped 2.7% the day the Tencent deal was announced. At $305 as of this writing, TSLA is now up 43% year-to-date, and a whopping 60% since the beginning of December. That kind of run from a company with a $48 billion market cap tends to bring naysayers out of the woodworks.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?Sure enough, Bob Lutz, a formerFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) executive,said, ""Raising capital is not going to help, because fundamentally the business equation on electric cars is wrong. They cost more to build than what the public is willing to pay. That's the bottom line.""Sour grapes? Perhaps. It's no secret that traditional automakers - and their executives - resent Tesla Motors' business model. And Ford, one of Lutz's former companies, just got passed by TSLA as the second-largest American automaker by market cap, and GM is within spitting distance.But Lutz does have a point: Tesla isn't making money, and hasn't for most of its relatively brief history.

It's still working out some kinks, particularly overseas. But its potential in places like China and India, each of which have four times as many drivers as America, is immense.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Still Has Countless CatalystsAfter a much better year in China, the Tencent deal should help improve its expanding Chinese footprint. And if nothing else, it looks good to investors when one of the richest companies in the world wants to be in business with you.Tesla Motors may not be rich itself - yet - but TSLA stock is still fresh and hip in the eyes of most investors, something companies likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) would kill to get back right about now. Things like the Tencent deal and Model 3 release should keep Tesla stock feeling fresh for quite some time.I say buy now while it's still ripe.As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive Upside10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Do Millennials Care About Stocks?;4/12/2017;"Welcome to Episode #77 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Ryan McQueeney, a Zacks Editor and also co-host of the weekly Friday Finish Line podcast with Maddy Johnson, and Parth Panchal, a Zacks intern and finance major at Loyola of Chicago, to discuss Millennials and investing.There's a myth that Millennials are all broke, living in their parents' basements, and have so much college debt it prohibits them from doing things, like investing some spare cash in the stock market.But a host of apps like Robinhood, which makes it nearly free for Millennials to trade, appear to be changing that.Do Millennials Care About Stocks?Tracey asked Ryan and Parth, two Millennials who, yes, also have an interest in finance so they are slightly biased, just what they and their friends invest in.Yes, they are buying stocks. Yes, even the history major, non-finance Millennials are interested. No, they're not buying ETFs.They like stocks that are highly volatile and have room to the upside such as the social media stocks or the biotechs.They also invest in what they know.As Parth said, ""Millennials like to have something in their hands"" so that means when they invest, they like to know, and most likely, love, the company they are buying. They are emotional investors.It's not surprising, then, that companies that feature prominently in Millennials lives are also among the more popular stocks.What Are Millennials Buying?1.       The Snapchat IPO (SNAP) was big among the younger Millennials. They are the original users of the product so they know it inside and out.2.       Facebook (FB) skews older but Millennials grew up using it. They cannot imagine a world without it so they also like the stock.3.       Tesla (TSLA) is another popular stock, not because they can afford to buy one of the cars, but because they like to think they can in the future. They like to buy stock in companies they believe in.4.       Alphabet (GOOGL) owns one of the most popular brands in the world, YouTube, but Millennial investors aren't really buying the stock. Why not? Tracey asked Parth and Ryan why Alphabet is left out in the cold.Where Do Millennials Get Their News?Millennials have short attention spans. They like to read headlines. But Millennial traders still need to get their financial news somewhere.Tracey was surprised to find out the top source of financial news for Millennials. You won't believe it either.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. Stock Is a Great Value Buy After Q1 Earnings (DAL);4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofDelta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) are on the rise Wednesday morning, climbing about 3% on a first-quarter earnings report that topped the pros' expectations. It's not much, but it's no surprise - DAL stock is habitually underappreciated, but perhaps that won't last for much longer.makeArticleAd();The headline numbers: Revenues of $9.15 billion declined 1.1% year-over-year and just slightly missed analysts' estimates. However, earnings came in at 77 cents per share, which was 2 cents better than the consensus mark.Delta's operating income was not incredibly impressive. Adjusted pre-tax income for the quarter came in at $847 million, down 45% year-over-year. DAL blamed higher fuel costs for the expense. Passenger unit revenues declined 0.5% on 0.5% lower capacity. An April storm will reduce the current quarter's pretax income by $125 million.They're good but not great earnings, though little of that is on Delta's head. Going forward, though, investors would do well to consider buying into DAL stock, as today's report might be the start of a much bigger run.It's Not What You Did, But What You're DoingYou can wear your nice socks when reading Delta'searnings releasewithout worry that it will blow them off. The quarter was OK - nothing too great, nothing too bad.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyBut considering that DAL stock trades at less than 8 times last year's earnings, there's no real expectation for amazing growth.Delta's situationwillimprove, though.Management noted that March was the first month it experienced positive passenger unit revenues since November 2015. Further, they expect current-quarter passenger unit revenues to climb 1% to 3% and to remain positive throughout the year. That's good, as are the comments from CFO Paul Jacobson regarding fuel costs:""We expect the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure to have occurred in the March quarter from higher fuel prices.""Speaking of margins, DAL's operating margins for the latest quarter came in at 11.5%. Again, nothing to write home about. But for the current quarter, Delta Air Lines expects operating margins of 17% to 19%. That's a substantial amount of improvement.Delta's StrengthsNow that earnings are out, what should investors do with DAL stock? Well, despite some ""meh"" to Delta's quarter, the stock actually looks pretty good.First, let's consider capital return. Delta shares yield 1.8% in dividends at current prices - not really enough to warrant a spot on our11 best dividend stocks list, but it is a decent payout.Second, Delta bought back $200 million worth of stock last quarter. This is down from the $775 million it bought back in the same period a year ago (although $350 million was accelerated for anti-dilution due to pension obligations). But the point is the same: DAL is in there buying back its stock.When a stock trades at less than 8 times earnings, buybacks are meaningful.It also helps that Warren Buffett is in there. Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B) currently owns about 8% of DAL stock. A bear might argue that Buffett is almost finished buying, since he's unlikely to acquire more than 10% of Delta. That's probably true. But between Buffett and Delta's buying - and almost more importantly, not selling - there is a significant chunk of stock that won't hit the open market for quite some time.It also helps that DAL stock hasn't had a PR fiasco quite likeUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL).What to Do With DAL StockThe valuation and Delta's price action play a big role here. DAL has been struggling, off 8% on the year. But its ultra-low valuation makes it awfully enticing.3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NBIX)For investors considering getting long, it's nice to know they're placing their chips alongside Warren Buffett too. A cheap and profitable stock that is trading off its highs and has Buffett's seal of approval … that' a winning recipe.Throw in the fact that Delta expects the current June quarter to go well, and presumably the rest of the year, and it wouldn't be surprising for DAL stock to make new highs in 2017. Conservative investors can buy the stock at current prices and use the 200-day moving average as their stop-loss. Currently around $43.60, the 200-day MA is about 4%-6% below current prices, depending on where DAL opens for trading.One last note: Delta Air Lines'conference call is scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday. Conference calls can always change the dynamics of an earnings result.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author ofFuture Blue Chips. He can be contacted on Twitter via@BretKenwell.

PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) Stock Could Build Gains in a Hurry;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of homebuilding stocks such asPulteGroup, Inc.(NYSE:PHM) rallied on Tuesday, April 11, and increasingly look ripe for another leg higher. Technically speaking, PHM stock has been consolidating and coiling up below a crucial multiyear horizontal resistance line. A break above this line could result in a fresh leg higher.makeArticleAd();Novice and experienced stock market operators alike often forget that stocks are highly correlated, with about 80% of stocks moving up and down together at any given time. I bring up this statistic anytime I come across an interesting-looking stock or index trading setup.Why? Because I always want to check to see whether the setup is there solely because of the broader stock market's movements, or because there's a  story of relative strength (or bullish trades) or relative weakness (for bearish trades). The latter typically gives a setup a higher probability of success.Case in point: Homebuilding stocks such as PHM - and indeed, the entire homebuilding space, as represented by theSPDR S&P Homebuilders (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XHB) - have been showing notable relative strength again so far in 2017.Click to EnlargeOn the daily chart, we see that the XHB recently broke past important horizontal resistance marked by the black horizontal line.3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of IncomeIt doesn't take much imagination to see homebuilders continue higher still after the most recent consolidation period runs its course.PHM Stock ChartsFor PulteGroup, its nearly 30% rally year-to-date has brought it back to the very upper end of a wide, multiyear sideways channel.Click to EnlargeThe bears will point to the fact that PHM shares are likely overbought. And until it scores a weekly breakout past the upper end of this channel (around the $24 area), the stock should remain rangebound.The bulls, however, note that this most recent assault at the upper end of the trading range has come off a meaningful higher low in late 2016, and that PHM stock is now trading much closer to its red 200-week moving average than at previous breakout attempts.In other words, PulteGroup might finally be ready to break out of this range on a more sustainable basis. However, as a nod to risk management, I will caution that until a breakout occurs, it simply hasn't yet occurred.Lastly, on the daily chart, note that PHM stock broke past horizontal resistance around the $22 mark in February. By early March, this led to the current consolidation phase.Click to EnlargeThis current consolidation phase is taking the shape of a bull flag pattern, which if and when resolved higher above the $24 mark offers next upside targets in $1 increments.3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NBIX)Note that PulteGroup is scheduled to report earnings on April 25. Again, from a risk management perspective, it would make sense to use reduced positions in PHM stock through the earnings announcement. That's because of the binary outcomes that typically follow such reports.Like what you see?

3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NBIX);4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTuesday saw stocks dip slightly, led by tech stocks, which were among the worst performers with 0.4% losses as a group. TheS&P 500fell 0.1%, theDow Jones Industrial Averagedipped 0.03% and theNasdaq Compositeslipped 0.2%.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Heading into Wednesday's trade,Delta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) is proving that airlines can make headlines for the right reasons, a major investor has issues with theTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) board andNeurocrine Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:NBIX) is hitting the roof on big FDA news.Here's what you should know heading into Wednesday:Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)While competitorUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL) broils under the heat of its own mismanaged PR situation, DAL shares are enjoying a nice post-earnings bump on the strength of a Street-beating first quarter.For Q1, Delta earned $603 million (82 cents per share) - a whopping 36% decline in profits. However, on an adjusted basis, the company still managed to leapfrog estimates of 75 cents by 2 cents. Revenues weren't as bad, just down 1% to $9.15 billion, though that was slightly below expectations for $9.18 billion.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017That all came amid middling operational metrics - a 0.5% increase in traffic to 47.95 billion revenue passenger miles, but a 1% decline in total passenger revenue to $7.69 billion. However, looking forward, the company expects the June quarter's passenger unit revenues to improve 1%-3% and ""remain positive throughout the year.""While it has been overshadowed by United's fiasco, Delta has been shoveling out of its own issues - namely, a multiday set of cancellations sparked by massive storms that rocked its primary Atlanta hub. DAL was forced to cancel several thousand flights, which Raymond James says could knock a percentage point off second-quarter unit revenue.Still, DAL stock is headed higher Wednesday morning by about 2%.Tesla Inc (TSLA)TSLA shares might be sitting right under all-time highs after finally breaking out of a three-year range, and they might be up a scorching 45% year-to-date, but that doesn't mean Tesla isn't without problems. Specifically, a few investors are pounding the table over Tesla's management team, and the EV maker is about to get some big-pocketed competition in China.Specifically, the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) have written a letter to Tesla's lead independent director saying that they want Tesla's board to add members not connected in some way to Elon Musk.Right now, Tesla's board members include Elon's brother, several SpaceX directors and investors and a former SolarCity C-suiter. Said the letter:""Directors should be held to a higher standard of independence given the conflicts of interest that permeate this board. A thoroughly independent board would provide a critical check on possible dysfunctional group dynamics, such as groupthink.""CalSTRS is no small potato, controlling roughly $720 billion in assets.Meanwhile, Tesla also faces a new challenger in China, withVolkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY) presenting an all-electric competitor to the Model X in Shanghai later this week.Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is a Big-Yielding Value TrapVolkswagen has set a goal to sell a million electric cars annually by 2025, and will try to get there with its I.D. lineup. The latest concept entry will be a crossover that is expected to be priced lower than the Model X, and includes an autonomous driving mode.Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NBIX)NBIX is popping by double digits after reporting some good news regarding one of its medications.The company's tardive dyskinesia received drug received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ahead of Wednesday's action.Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of taking anti-psychotic medications that causes uncontrolled movement of the face and body. Tardive dyskinesia affects between 5% and 8% of patients who take these medications.The drug, Ingrezza, is the first drug of its kind to gain FDA approval. The drug is expected to cost between $20,000 and $60,000 annually, depending on the necessary dosage. Investors are excited about analysts' projections for annual sales of about $700 million by 2023.NBIX shares are up more than 20% in early Wednesday action.More From InvestorPlaceThe 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyVanguard Dividend Funds3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of IncomeThe post3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Tesla, Inc.

This Is The Future Of Energy. Here's How To Invest...;4/12/2017;"Recently my team and I have been telling my readers about a   quiet revolution that's taking place thanks to eccentric   billionaire Elon Musk and his band of scientists at Tesla Motors   (Nasdaq:TSLA).You see, for years they've been working feverishly at their   lab in Fremont, California on a battery that could provide enough   energy to power a house.Last year, news came along that they'd finally broken   through.And now, for the first time in decades, we could see the   entire utility sector turned on its head as a result -- leading   to massive gains for early investors.As you can see, Tesla's battery storage device looks nothing   like your old-fashioned AA battery.It's a sleek, compact unit that you can mount on the wall in   your garage. One single, stand-alone unit delivers enough power   to take an entire home completely off the grid. Simply charge it   with a solar panel, windmill or any other power source, and   you've got all the energy you need.Thanks to Tesla, the world is about to see that an energy   sea-change has been quietly unfolding before their eyes for   several years now.And many of the world's greatest investors are quickly staking   their claims in this new technology.Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel -- the first   outside investor in Facebook -- has poured in millions of dollars   of his own money. (As one of the early supporters of Donald   Trump's presidential run, it's rumored Thiel has the President's   ear, too.)Bill Gates has made not one, but three big investments. And   Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has jumped in as well.But it's not just the brilliance of this energy storage device   that makes it an appealing investment space.It's the timing.You see, this device is going to enter the market at a time   when demand for a product like this has never been higher. In   fact, there are three intriguing factors making this technology   particularly promising.1. U.S. Political SupportBecause of geo-politics and concerns about pollution, governments   are falling over themselves to get more energy storage systems in   place.Take California, for instance. That one single state could   cause every public company in the energy storage industry to soar   triple-digits, thanks to new legislation, mandating that its   largest utilities have enough energy storage capacity to provide   electrical support for 1 million homes.That's the equivalent of building a dam's worth of   infrastructure. And they want it in place by 2020.Keep in mind: when the governments mandate something, it isn't   simply a request. It's the law. If utilities don't comply,   they'll be punished. That's why California's largest utilities --   from Con Edison to Pacific Gas and Electric -- are already   jumping on this.Massachusetts is following California's lead. It just launched   a $10 million initiative and aims to be a national leader in   energy storage.And New York, Texas, Oregon, Arizona and other states are   making similar moves.2. Global Political SupportGermany is dedicating $56 million a year specifically for energy   storage. Japan is setting aside $700 million, aiming to be the   ""world leader"" in energy storage. And China is jumping in with   both feet. Its energy storage market is projected to quadruple   over the next decade.The driving factor behind this global push for energy storage   is simple. Reducing pollution.""If China doubles its energy production over the next two   decades,"" billionaire Peter Thiel points out, ""it will also   double its air pollution. If every one of India's hundreds of   millions of households were to live the way Americans already do   -- using only today's tools -- the result would be   environmentally catastrophic. Spreading old ways to create wealth   around the world will result in devastation, not riches.""In fact, the International Energy Agency has called on world   leaders to spend a combined $380 billion on energy storage by   2050.3. Public SupportBut political support is only half the story. The energy storage   revolution is really being driven by the public at large, and it   all funnels down to one thing.Freedom.For some people, it's freedom from utility companies. They   don't like the fact that utilities are essentially a monopoly and   can raise their rates at a whim. With an energy storage system,   you wouldn't have to worry about this.Others want to ""get out from under big brother,"" as one energy   storage user told USA Today.He and others like him don't trust that the government won't   try to control their energy consumption simply because they're   running their A/C longer than a bureaucrat deems proper.Bottom line:The energy revolution is coming. And Tesla's battery storage   device is just part of the story.Now here's the thing... I'm not recommending you invest in   Tesla. I've identifiedthree little-known stocksthat could soar 10 times higher by 2020 -- and they'll do it by   riding Tesla's coattails.Sure, Tesla is likely to see some nice long-term gains thanks   to this revolution. But the lion's share of the gains will be   found in smaller, lesser-known companies that are making this   technology a reality.Make no mistake: Opportunities like this don't come around   very often. And when the public catches on to this revolution,   the big gains will have already been made.You can click here to view my full report.Related ArticlesThe Indicator That Defies Everything You Know       About Value InvestingTest: A Proven System You Should ConsiderA Proven System You Should Consider"

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);4/11/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are ducking lower heading into the open this morning, as Wall Street waits for directional cues in the increasingly volatile geopolitical environment. Heading up this morning's worry list; the U.S. is taking a hard line on Syria at this week's G-7 meeting, while North Korea says it's ready for war if U.S. warships continue toward the Korean Peninsula.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open,Dow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are down 0.04%,S&P 500futures are down 0.12% andNasdaq-100futures are off 0.11%.On the options front, volume was a tad light on Monday, with only about 12.4 million calls and 10.8 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropped to 0.62, while the 10-day moving average continued to hold at 0.61.Driving Monday's options volume,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) call activity spiked after the company received a bizarre upgrade from Piper Jaffray. Elsewhere,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) options activity was mixed following a bearish note from BMO Capital Markets, andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) faltered after buying VR intellectual property fromNiterofor an undisclosed sum.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Piper Jaffray analystAlex Potter upgraded TSLA stockfrom ""neutral"" to ""overweight"" on Monday, and lifted his price target from $223 to $368. Nothing out of the ordinary, right?The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyBut, Potter also slashed his earnings outlook for Tesla to a full-year loss of $4.83 per share from a profit of 42 cents per share and stated that clients needed to ""employ a 'creative' valuation methodology and prepare for a bumpy ride.""The commentary confused Wall Street's talking heads, but traders send TSLA stock more than 3% higher and options traders piled into calls. In fact, volume surged to a near-term high of near 406,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 60% of the day's take.That said, much of yesterday's call activity may have been profit taking in the wake of TSLA stock hitting a fresh all-time high. Specifically the stock's May put/call open interest rose from below 0.80 last week to today's perch at 0.88. In short, puts are being added at a faster rate than calls among near-term options, hinting that options traders are either betting on a reversal or taking profits from existing long-call positions.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)NVDA stock saw mixed options activity on Monday afterBMO Capital Markets issued a bearish noteon GPU supply chain data. According to BMO, supply chain checks said that GPU shipments were down 16% between December and March, versus an average decline of 6% for the past three years. ""We also believe this data suggests that weakness in Nvidia's gaming business might show up earlier than we had anticipated,"" BMO told clients.NVDA stock fell more than 2.5% as a result, and options traders had a hard time maintaining a call bias. Total volume arrived above average at 389,000 contracts, but calls only made up 52% of the day's take.Meanwhile,Trade-Alert.comdata reveal that two large blocks of 20,000 contracts (marked spread) traded at the bid on both the May $105 put and call. Implieds declined on the strikes following the trades. On the surface, this appears to be the closure of a May $105 straddle position following NVDA's dip below $100 yesterday.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)In the same report, BMO Capital noted that supply chain data was strong for CPU manufacturers, like Advanced Micro Devices, and it could have been an up day for AMD stock. However, AMD made investors nervous bypurchasing wireless VR intellectual property from Niterofor an undisclosed sum. AMD said the deal would provide ""broader portfolio of IP capable of enabling VR headset and solution providers with key technology required to create more immersive computing experiences,"" but the undisclosed price remained a sticking point for investors.United Continental Won't Pay for Its All-Time PR Fail (UAL)As a result, AMD fell more than 3% on the day, but that activity was belied by heavy call activity in the options pits. Total volume came in at more than 254,000 contracts, with calls gobbling up 72% of the day's take.What's more, the May put/call OI ratio ticked lower from 0.74 on Friday to 0.71 yesterday, as calls were opened at a faster rate than puts among short-term options, hinting that AMD options traders view yesterday's dip as a buying opportunity.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The 7 Best Retirement Stocks That No One Talks AboutShort Apple Inc.

Have too many groceries? Get an Uber. Too drunk? Get an Uber. Stressful day at work? Uber. Like magic-now, it's really an expectation-any transportation woes vanish with the digital sight of a car heading your way.Launched only seven years ago,Uber Technologies Inc.is an app-based transportation company headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in about 270 cities and more than 60 countries worldwide. Using the app is easy: just type in your current location, where you want to go, and hit request Uber. From there, Uber uses its app to receive its ride requests, sending them out to drivers who transport customers to their final destination.Increased CompetitionThe emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.In addition to the now-defunct Sidecar, companies like Lyft, Curb, Southeast Asia-based Grab, India's Ola, and especially China's Didi Chuxing have all started to eat into the ride-hailing market share, becominghuge competitorsfor Uber. Didi is arguably Uber's biggest threat overseas, and the ride-sharing giant conceded defeat in August,selling its UberChina operationsto Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies.Even Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) is becoming a threat to Uber, with plans to make its self-driving cars unit a stand-alone business. This initiative could put the company in direct competition with Uber, as the lack of a driver could keep costs down in the long-term. The company's Google division also recently began a pilot program with Waze, a company they acquired in 2013, that enables thousands of San Francisco commuters to join carpools; Waze also offers real-time driving directions based on information from other drivers.Self-Driving, Uber StyleBut Uber is right on Google's heels, and asself-driving car technologybecomes more commercially available, Uber has been constantly beefing up its business strategies focused on autonomous driving. Back in September, it began testing its self-driving Ford (NYSE:F-Free Report) Fusions in Pittsburgh; engineers rode in the driver's seat, ready to take over whenever things got tricky.Uber then introduced self-driving Volvo XC90s to San Francisco in December, and riders who requested an uberX were matched with one of these vehicles if one was available. Just days later, however, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for its self-driving cars, as the company didn't have the proper permits.But Uber being Uber, the fleet of Volvos were on their way to Arizona within days. Uber already operates a self-driving car program in the state, and in 2015, partnered with the University of Arizona to research mapping technology.Uber also recently acquired a car start-up Otto, which specializes in self-driving trucks. Otto is a 90-person company, and its co-founder, Anthony Levandowski, will now lead Uber into the self-driving car market. Impressively, Otto engineers have worked at Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), and Google, and with this knowledge and expertise, Uber is bound to be a top player in the self-driving car industry.ControversyWhile Uber has seen great success, it's journey has been a bumpy one. The company has been in and out of the news thanks to a number of recent legal (Alphabet iscurrently suingthem for theft of its self-driving car technology) and reputation-hurting (note the company'ssexual harassment scandaland CEO Travis Kalanick's rude behavior towards a driver) headlines. And from noncompliance issues in New York City to regulatory concerns and lack of driver background checks, Uber has drawn scrutiny and criticism, and has even been banned in The Netherlands and in parts of Thailand, India, and China.It's no secret that traditional taxi services are not happy with the rise of Uber and other ride-hailing companies, and many argue that Uber should be subject to the same regulations that they face. In dozens of cities it has moved in to, Uber has faced intense opposition, lobbying, and legal challenges against it from these taxi companies.Uber has also been embroiled in along-standing battlewith its drivers. A group of drivers first sued the company back in 2013, claiming they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. As a result, Uber had been set to pay up to $100 million in reimbursement damages to almost 400,000 drivers, but recently, a federal judge in California ruled that the settlement was unfair.But as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, and all of the bad press has yet to really negatively affect Uber. Despitelosing over $1 billionin the first half of 2016, Uber gained just as much revenue in that same time period. Its ability to raise exorbitant amounts of money is incredibly impressive for a company who is less than a decade old, and this skill makes Uber that much more attractive to venture capital investors.IPO PotentialDespite these controversies, investors are eagerly awaiting an Uber IPO. Many have believed, or hoped, the company would go public for a few years now, but Mr. Kalanick wants ""to make sure [an IPO] happens as late as possible,"" said in an interview with CNBC last year.If and when Uber finally decides to go public, its potential would depend on the broader IPO market and economic environment. According to Renaissance Capital, IPOs only raised a paltry $18.9 billion in 2016, with annual proceeds falling to the lowest level since 2003. Just four companies filed public offerings that grossed over $1 billion.Looking ahead, it's difficult to pinpoint how busy the IPO market will be this year. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP-Free Report), the parent company of Snapchat, finally made that giant step last month, but it's hard to say what, and if any, other high-profile unicorns-i.e. Spotify, Pinterest, Airbnb, and yes, Uber-will follow. And recent high-growth IPOs like Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO-Free Report) have traded strongly since their debut, a good sign for tech companies everywhere looking to make their trading debut.How Might Uber Perform?An IPO for Uber could be massive for both the company and Wall Street. It's currently valued at $68 billion after a total of nine rounds of funding worth $12.9 billion since its launch. And thanks to Uber's structure-a unique combination of transportation company, mobile Internet company, and real world engineering-the company has been touted as one of the best future IPOs.It's IPO, then, could go either way, but let one number stay in your mind: $68 billion. Let me write that again: $68 billion. This number is a hard one to forget, and a figure that will be on the forefront of many investors' minds come the time of its public offering, as it impressively showcases just how far this startup has come in a few short years.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for free.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Tesla, Tencent Holdings, American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings and Allison Transmission Holdings;4/11/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 11, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeTesla, Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),Tencent Holdings Ltd.(OTCMKTS:TCEHY-Free Report),American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.(NYSE:AXL-Free Report) andAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc.(NYSE:ALSN-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Is a Chinese Factory Part of Tesla's Expansion Plans?Rumors ofTesla, Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) building a factory in China have surfaced once again. Southern Metropolis Daily, a local Guangdong province newspaper, has claimed (citing sources) that the company plans to independently fund and construct a factory in the region.Per the report, Tesla has already approved a site for the facility and is awaiting the green signal from the local government. The report also speculated that the project will be announced within a year if the plan proceeds smoothly.However, the electric vehicle producer has denied the report, as told to CNBC. Tesla reiterated its commitment to the Chinese market, the second largest auto market globally, but stated that the plans outlined per the report are untrue.Tesla in ChinaAs the report noted, a manufacturing unit in China would help Tesla reduce its border tax. Recently, Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. (OTCMKTS:TCEHY-Free Report) purchased a 5% stake or 8.17 million shares in the company for $1.8 billion, making it the fifth largest shareholder and paving a way for Tesla's further expansion in China. Tencent, also based in Guangdong, stated that the companies currently do not have any cooperative plans but may work together in the future.Tesla's market in China is significantly growing. The company saw its annual revenues from the country increase more than three times to over $1.06 billion in 2016, making it second only to revenues from the U.S. China imported 11,839 Tesla vehicles in 2016, five times more than the previous year. It has 24 stores and 348 regular charging stations in the country.Regulatory RequirementsWhile rumors of Tesla building a factory in China appear repeatedly, a number of problems may also hinder the company in making this a reality. China has a policy requiring foreign auto manufacturers to set up joint ventures with local companies to produce vehicles. Moreover, the foreign manufacturers cannot own more than 50% in the venture. Therefore, it isn't clear whether the government would approve a plant owned independently by a foreign automaker.Rumors of a factory being set up by Tesla in partnership with other local companies have surfaced in the past. All of them have been subsequently denied by Tesla.PerformanceTesla outperformed the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry over the last three months. During the period, Tesla gained 31.6% while the industry witnessed a 0.6% rise. The outperformance has been supported by expansion plans and higher deliveries in first-quarter 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked companies in the auto space include American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.

3 Crucial Milestones Tesla, Inc. Must Hit This Year;4/11/2017;"WithTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock rising nearly 60% in the past six months,   its valuation is pricing in significant growth in the coming   years. But investors won't have to wait years for Tesla's ability   to execute on ambitious growth targets to be tested. In 2017,   Tesla has three milestones on the horizon it will need to achieve   to keep investors betting optimistically on the company's   longer-term growth potential.Look for Tesla to live up to these three important landmark   targets for 2017.makeArticleAd();TSLAdata byYCharts1. Model 3 productionIt's difficult to overstate just how important the Model 3 is   to Tesla's stock price. With a starting price of $35,000, or   about half the starting price of its pricier Model S sedan, the   upcoming vehicle represents the culmination of Tesla's efforts to   date. Ever since Tesla CEO Elon Musk laid out his ""secret master   plan"" in 2006, Tesla's mission was crystal clear: Tesla's pricier   vehicles were only a medium for the company to build a business   that could eventually support production of a higher volume, more   affordable vehicle -- the Model 3.But it's 2017 now, and it's time for Tesla to deliver on its   promise. As of Tesla's most recent shareholder letter, the   company said it plans to begin Model 3 production in July.Can Tesla pull it off?2. Volume production of Model 3Of course, Tesla is going to need to do more than begin   production of Model 3 in 2017. It needs to ramp up production to   a significant volume. With a market capitalization of $51 billion   yet having only delivered 86,500 vehicles in the trailing 12   months, investors are betting that Tesla will not only begin   Model 3 production, but eventually scale it to annual production   in the hundreds of thousands.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: authorTesla has said it expects to achieve ""volume production"" in   September.What could the production ramp-up of Model 3 look like? Tesla   gave a preview of what management expects in the company's   fourth-quarter shareholder letter:""Our Model 3 program is on track to start limited vehicle   production in July and to steadily ramp production to exceed   5,000 vehicles per week at some point in the fourth quarter and   10,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2018.""For the entire year of 2018, Tesla expects the combined   production of Model S, X, and 3 to add up to about 500,000   units.3. Production ramp-up of solar glass tilesAnother key area investors should keep their eyes on is   Tesla's ability to put its late 2016-acquisition of SolarCity to   work. One of the first targets on the horizon for Tesla's solar   business is bringing its new glass solar tiles to market and   ramping up their production.Home with Tesla solar tiles. Image source: Tesla.In Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call, Tesla's chief   technology officer, J.B. Straubel, said Tesla will ""ramp and   start scaling"" production of its solar tiles by the end of the   year.For Tesla to live up to high investor expectations, it's going   to have to deliver on these three near-term milestones first.   Otherwise, investors will have little confidence in Tesla's   longer-term targets, namely its goal to produce 500,000 vehicles   annually by next year and 1 million annually in 2020.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla (TSLA) Becomes U.S. Most Valuable Automaker, Passing GM;4/11/2017;"Tesla (Shutterstock photo)Can anything stop Tesla (TSLA)? The California-based luxury electric vehicle company, which calls itself the “Quickest production car on earth,” has just outpaced General Motors (GM) in market value — somethingI told you a week agowas poised to happen. Admittedly, I didn’t think it would come this quickly.Tesla shares raced 3.26% higher Monday on strong volume, reaching yet another new all-time high at $313.73. In the process, Elon Musk’s fourteen year-old company briefly emerged as the largest automaker in the U.S. based on market capitalization, surpassing 120-year old GM. Whether TSLA maintains its lead remains to be seen. But if you’re a GM or Ford (F) shareholder, does that really matter?makeArticleAd();The bigger story here is the enormous belief investors have placed in the promises Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made, which by contrast renders the slow-growing GM and Ford — despite dominating Tesla in total vehicle sales — to “used car” status. Reutersnotedthat Tesla’s market cap — which peaked Monday at $51.105 billion — is now the equivalent to $102,000 for every car it plans to make in 2018, or $667,000 per car sold in 2016. This compares to GM's market cap which is equivalent to $5,000 per car it sold in 2016.Does it make sense? The comparison seems to imply there’s some irrational thinking going on in terms of investors’ confidence in Tesla. TSLA stock, which has already soared 46% year to date, besting the 5.2% rise in the S&P 500 index, continues to defy gravity. ""As a car company alone, Tesla is crazy high valuation,” said Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital hedge fund manager, who oversees more than $105 billion in assets.Gundlach, who sees more reasonable value in the battery component of Tesla’s business, is essentially saying Musk still has a lot to prove, including making Tesla more mainstream. And it’s for this reason Tesla investors shouldn’t even think aboutparking their shares. According to analysts Alex Potter at Piper Jaffray, Tesla can still deliver 17% additional gains in the next twelve months.Tesla is still riding the momentum of its strong first-quarter delivery total, reaching 25,000 cars. On Monday the analyst raised its rating on TSLA stock to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $368 from $223 per share. ""In many ways, [Tesla] seems to play by its own rules,"" Potter wrote in a research Monday.As evidenced by the strong stock returns delivered in 2017, those “rules” involve making investors rich. And investors should keep playing until those rules change."

General Motors' Answer to Tesla's Autopilot Is a Step Forward;4/10/2017;"Self-driving technology -- at least, the stuff you'll soon be   able to buy -- takes another step forward:General Motors(NYSE: GM) said its hands-free, highway-driving system, Super   Cruise, will come to market later this year as an option on the   Cadillac CT6 luxury sedan.At first glance, Super Cruise seems similar toTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Autopilot, the best-known ""hands-free,""   driver-assist system. But it's a bit different: Super Cruise adds   some new pieces to existing driver-assist systems to create a   genuine Level 3 partial self-driving system -- and that raises   some interesting questions.GM's Super Cruise highway-assist system will debut later     this year as an option on the big Cadillac CT6 sedan. Image     source: General Motors.makeArticleAd();What GM said about Super CruiseIn what might be a subtle dig at Tesla, GM said Super Cruise   is ""the industry's first true hands-free driving technology for   the highway:""Unlike other driver assistance systems, Super Cruise     utilizes two advanced technology systems - a driver attention     system and precision LiDAR map data - to ensure safe and     confident vehicle operation.These systems are added to the network of cameras and radar     sensors in the CT6, providing a more data-rich approach to     driver assistance that is unique in the industry.One of those two new systems is clearly a good thing. We know   that the first full self-driving systems will require highly   detailed maps of the areas in which they operate, to supplement   the information from the car's sensors. GM has created such a map   for Super Cruise: Its ""precision LiDAR map data"" includes finely   detailed maps of all highways in the U.S. and Canada, which the   system can use to double-check (or back up) its sensor readings.   That's a welcome addition.It's the ""driver attention system"" that will raise eyebrows,   at least among self-driving experts. Here's why.Almost self-driving -- but not quiteFirst, let's define some terms. Under the classification   system for vehicle-automation systems developed by the Society of   Automotive Engineers and adopted around the world, GM's Super   Cruise appears to be a Level 3 system. That's the highest levelbelowfully self-driving systems, in which no human intervention is   necessary.A Level 3 system is defined as one that can drive itself under   certain conditions. But -- and this is a big ""but"" -- the human   driver has to be alert and ready to take over on short notice, if   something comes up that the system isn't equipped to handle.   That, in turn, means the system has to keep tabs on its drivers   to ensure they are paying attention and ready to take over   if needed.That's where GM's ""driver attention system"" comes in. The   system uses a small camera and infrared sensors to track the   driver's head position whenever Super Cruise is operating. If it   determines that the driver has looked away from the road ahead   for too long, it prompts the driver to return his or her   attention to the road.Lights built into the steering wheel's rim alert drivers to     the status of the Super Cruise system -- and help keep the     driver's eyes from wandering off of the road. Image source:     General Motors.If the driver doesn't respond immediately, the system keeps   driving the car while it works through a series of escalating   alerts to get the driver's attention. The alerts include lights,   sounds, and ""tactile alerts"" transmitted by the car's seats --   each one (hopefully) harder for the driver to miss. (If the   driver is still unresponsive, the system brings the car to a safe   stop and uses GM's OnStar system to call for help.)Some automakers aren't even trying Level 3Partial self-driving systems came under scrutiny after afatal accidentinvolving a Tesla last year. In that incident, a Tesla Model S on   Autopilot ran full-speed into a tractor-trailer truck crossing   the road. The Tesla's driver, whose attention may have been   turned away from the road, did not survive the collision.That accident made it clear that automakers offering partial   self-driving systems needed to find ways to ensure that drivers   were paying attention -- at least enough attention to grab the   controls quicklyif something (like a white truck crossing the highway on a bright   sunny day, as in the Tesla incident) came up that the system   couldn't handle.And that has proven to be a challenge that at least some other   automakers, including a big GM rival with good technology, are   choosing not to try to tackle.Ford(NYSE: F) said last year that it haddecided not to develop a Level 3 systemat all, because its research had shown that drivers found   the required attention-checking systems to be -- yes -- too   annoying.Has GM solved the driver-attention problem?Will drivers find Super Cruise's attention monitoring and   reminders to be too much? Given that GM has enough   confidence in Super Cruise to launch it on a high-end Cadillac, I   expect GM believes it has found a way to effectively nudge   drivers without causing too much irritation.We'll know soon: Your humble Fool will get a close-up look at   GM's new Super Cruise system later this week. I'll let you know   exactly what I think after I check it out.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Tesla, Inc. Shares Jumped Today;4/10/2017;"Shares ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped today, setting a fresh all-time record high   of nearly $314 and also briefly overtaking GM as the most   valuable U.S. automaker by market cap. The companies remained   neck-and-neck in terms of market valuation as shares fluctuated   during normal trading.A lot of the bullishness on Tesla's part today comes from an   analyst upgrade. Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter has   upgraded Tesla shares from neutral to overweight, while   meaningfully ratcheting up the firm's price target from $223 to   $368. That's a pretty big change, especially considering the fact   that the prior price target was well below current prices, and   the new price target represents nearly 20% upside.A Tesla store. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();""Tesla isn't just another company""Potter and his team purchased a Tesla vehicle for research   purposes, and have been driving it regularly for the past seven   months. The analyst writes that Tesla vehicles have a   ""captivating impact"" on both customers and investors, which peers   have a hard time replicating. ""Tesla isn't just another company""   to customers, employees, and investors, according to Potter. He   doesn't even think a botched Model 3 launch could hurt investor   optimism, believing that shareholders would simply ""withhold   judgment.""Piper notes that Tesla faces plenty of risks going forward,   but these risks don't faze the stock at all. ""Even with all the   risks, we think growth investors can't afford to ignore this   stock,"" the analyst writes. In terms of unit estimates, Potter   expects Tesla to miss its 2018 target of 500,000 deliveries, but   thinks the company can make up for this in 2019 by delivering   over 750,000 units. Gross margin is expected in the low- to   mid-20s range on the automotive side (in line with Tesla's   current profitability levels), and Potter does not expect Tesla   to need additional capital raises going forward.It's hard to value Tesla using conventional metricsThe analyst concedes that trying to assign a price target for   Tesla requires a ""creative"" approach to valuation. This is likely   due to the fact that Tesla has no directly comparable peers,   given its ambitions for the energy sector as well as its   different approaches to the auto industry, as seen in direct   sales.It's no secret that Tesla shares are almost impossible to   value, which is also why bearish theses that are predicated   entirely on valuation alone using conventional metrics may be   doomed. That's not to say that Tesla doesn't make mistakes in   terms of operations and execution, another common theme among   bears, but misaligned body panels aren't bringing down the   company anytime soon. Tesla is, and will remain for the   foreseeable future, the ultimate story stock.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Beyond Tesla: 2 Lithium Stocks to Buy Now;4/10/2017;"While the market for Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries has a ton of untapped potential,Tesla Inc.'sTSLAdecision to build a$5 billion Gigafactoryto meet its requirement of lithium-ion battery packs brought glaring focus on the shortage of supply of this emerging energy storage technology.Li-ion batteries are a type of rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the anode to cathode during discharge, and from cathode to anode when charging. They are a popular choice by electric car manufacturers, and are used byGeneral Motors Co.GM, Navistar International Corp.NAV,BMW AGBAMXF,Daimler AGDDAIF, andFord Motor Co.F, among many others. Li-ion batteries are also used in cellphones, laptops, and other electronic devices as well as in the aerospace and defense sector.Back in January, it was reported thatPanasonic Corp.PCRFYagreed to invest up to $1.6 billionin Tesla's Gigafactory. Kazuhiro Tsuga, President of Panasonic, said that ""We are sort of waiting on the demand from Tesla. If Tesla succeeds and the electric vehicle becomes mainstream, the world will be changed and we will have lots of opportunity to grow.""By 2020, Tesla expects the annual Li-ion battery production of the Gigafactory to exceed the global production in 2013. The factory will produce enough battery packs to allow Tesla to build around 500,000 electric cars annually by 2020.Production at the Gigafactory is slated to begin by the end of this year, but until then, the focus will be on other lithium-related companies. Thus, it would be a good idea to invest in some companies that manufacture these batteries, as well as those who directly handle lithium.Let's take a look at two stocks that are looking good at the moment:Arotech Corp.ARTXhas two business divisions: Training and Simulation, and Battery and Power Systems. The Battery and Power Systems division manufactures and sells Lithium and Zinc-Air batteries and smart chargers for the military and to the private defense industry in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.ARTX stock has gained more than 17% over the past 12 months, and has an average earnings surprise of 106.25%. It's a relatively smaller company, with a market cap of currently $84.51 million. Arotech, however, is in a fast-growing industry;Electronics-Militaryis in the top 2% of all industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank.Arotech has a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.22, lower than the industry average of 1.92. It has seen historic cash flow growth of 51.58% and historic EPS growth of 700%, both well above the industry averages of 6.32% and 14.24%, respectively. While 2017 looks to be a mixed year for Arotech, the company expects year-over-year earnings growth of 200% for its next quarter, and sales growth of just about 5% in the same period.Albemarle Corp.ALBis a major producer of fine and performance chemicals including bromine, catalysts, and lithium, and the company became the world's largest supplier of lithium when it acquired Rockwood Holdings back in January 2015. Bloomberg estimates Albemarle's share of the world's lithium to be about 35%.ALB, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, reported an average earnings surprise from each of the trailing 4 quarters of 14.28%. The company sits in a fairly strong industry as well;Chemical-Diversifiedis in the top 18% of all industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's current year (ending December 2017) is $4.17 per share, reflecting 16.74% year-over-year growth.Albemarle has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.42, above the industry average of 16.54. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 4.11, while its current PEG ratio sits at 1.84. ALB stock has seen historic EPS growth of 18.51% and historic cash flow growth of 3.41%.Bottom LineAs a whole, the lithium industry has blossomed over the last couple of years, and according to Frost & Sullivan, the global market for Li-ion batteries doubled to $22.5 billion in 2016 from $11.7 billion in 2012. Consumer goods and automobile sectors, in large part drove the demand.And, the share of the automobile sector in the Li-ion battery market grew to 25% in 2016 from 14% in 2012, per the data from Frost & Sullivan. This represents a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 37%.As lithium emerges as a vital component in battery supply, in addition in the increasing use of Li-ion batteries in consumer electronic products and efforts to promote the use of electric cars by many governments to curb pollution, the demand for these batteries is expected to rise.For an in-depth discussion on Li-ion batteries and the rise of electric vehicles, make sure to check out Zacks' free report ""Electric Cars: Which Companies Will Surge?""

Tesla Inc Hype Hits a Fever Pitch (TSLA);4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has now overtaken bothFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) to become America's most valuable automaker - at least by market capitalization.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDespite the fact the electric vehicle purveyor only sells a small fraction of the units of the established players, investors look beyond Model 3 production ramp fears, a large cash burn rate and a very extended valuation to push shares to fresh highs.In trading on Monday, shares are up another 3.4% to push beyond the $310-a-share threshold. This is up nearly a third from the lows hit in late February. And it represents a whopping 72% rise from the early December low. Tesla's market capitalization hit $51.17 billion, eclipsing GM's $51.1 billion and Ford's $45.1 billion valuations.The hype is real as the company continues to tick many of the right boxes for Wall Street: It's a play on autonomous vehicles, a play on EVs going mainstream, it's both a big-tech and socially-responsible investing play, and it's poised to benefit should President Trump, as hasrecently been reported, embraces a carbon tax to gain Democratic support for hits tax reform plans.Yet one wonders when hopefulness turns to hard expectations and investors demand actual results. GM maintains a 17.3% market share and has beat Tesla to market with a mainstream EV with a 200-plus mile range; compare that to Tesla's 0.2% U.S. market share and its yet-to-be-launched Model 3. The company is targeting the production of 500,000 vehicles next year, up from just 84,000 last year.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyMuch of the recent rise in TSLA was driven by the allaying of capital raising fears after China'sTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY), owner of Chinese social network WeChat, acquired a 5% stake in the company.Possible overconfidence is appearing, with TSLA CEO Elon Musk taking to Twitter recently to mock the bears. Headwinds noted by the skeptics, including everything from a weak balance sheet, tendency to dilute existing shareholders with secondary offerings and even questionable product decisions like avoiding LIDAR technology, have simply not mattered.Even Wall Street analysts are throwing in the towel, with Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter upgrading the stock to overweight with a $368 price target - a 65% increase - admitting ""we sympathize with bears - but their (arguably rational) arguments probably won't matter.""The company will next report results on May 24 after the close.

Despite Missteps, BP Plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Still Deliver the Goods;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether people want to admit it or not, President Donald Trump has been good for the markets. The benchmark exchange-traded fundSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY) is up 5% year-to-date. This is fairly remarkable, considering that since the beginning of March, Wall Street has hit a slow patch. The one sector that hasn't quite received the benefits of the ""Trump rally"" are energy stocks.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrIt's a reversal of fortune for companies likeBP Plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP). Once a poster child for oil stocks mired in a public relations crisis, BP eventually clawed its way back.While I won't excuse thehorrific damagethat the company caused in the 2010 oil spill, what's done is done. People and corporations can't wallow in their mistakes forever. BP took it on the chin, and soldiered on, ultimately gaining 31% in 2016.Right now, however, the enthusiasm does not appear to have carried over. BP stock is down 6.3% since its January opener, and is struggling to break out of the doldrums. Since early February, BP has largely gone nowhere.Naturally, several investors are frustrated.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The ""good news"" about the pedestrian trading is that energy stocks overall are heavily burdened, particularly big oil stocks. Marquee rivals such asExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM),Royal Dutch Shell Plc(ADR)(NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B) andChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) haven't shown much to their shareholders, either. Therefore, BP stock is unlikely to lose much volume to its core competitors.However, schadenfreude has limited value on Wall Street. Can BP stock rise above the fray in energy stocks on its own merits?BP Stock Has a Mountain to ClimbAt first glance, that notion doesn't seem very plausible. AsInvestorPlacewriter Tom Taulli notes, BP isnot blessedwith great financials. Against key metrics such as profitability margins, return-on-equity, and sales growth, BP stock is consistently terrible. Worse, the company ranks well below the average among big oil stocks.That's saying a lot considering the pain inflicted against energy stocks in general. Major clunkers exist within the sector, dragging the entire average way down. Even with that mulligan, BP stock fundamentally looks extremely ugly.Then, as Taulli states, you have to factor in oil price volatility. Frankly, energy stocks are getting a bum deal so far this year because of their underlying indices. Apparently, the international benchmark Brent Crude Oil is still deciding whether it wants to play ""good cop"" or ""bad cop."" Currently, it's playing bad cop, with the Brent index down 7% year to date.Finally, some high-level headwinds are making their presence known. Acting as the biggest culprit is the U.S. Dollar Index. The greenback has lost significant ground this year, down more than 2%. Still, it is unusually elevated against historical averages. Furthermore, the hawkish tone that the U.S. Federal Reserve is transmitting isn't doing BP and other oil stocks any favors.Don't Overlook the Positives for BP!On the flip side, the bearishness towards BP stock sets up a great contrarian play for the speculator. For starters, it was hit harder than other energy stocks in its class. Presently, Exxon-Mobil is down about 14% from its 2014 closing high. For Chevron, it's even tighter at around 10% down. BP stock, though, takes the cake with a disparity of over 22%.Even if shares don't do particularly well, BP can still be a winner for shareholders. All it has to do is not crumble - a fairly reasonable task given what it has gone through already. Both Mr. Taulli and fellowInvestorPlacecontributor Will Ashworth point out the 7.1%dividend yield. Not only is the yield substantially better than the competition, management is forced to abide by it, in a way.Click to EnlargeBP stock has been a laggard for many, many years. Cutting the yield will not only send the wrong message, it would be a repeat of the PR mistake that gutted the oil firm during the oil spill crisis. I'd like to think that even an oil company is better than that.That might be wishful thinking. However, what's not deniable is the technical stability that BP stock has found.Netflix, Inc. Stock Gets a Pat on the Back From Piper Jaffray (NFLX)Yes, 2017 has started off on the wrong foot. From the close of Feb. 11, 2016 until December 2016 ended, BP has lifted skyward by a more than 30% margin. That magnitude of enthusiasm has to be corrected before it can begin a next move higher.When factoring in an improving labor market, and the potential of vacationershitting the road, BP actually has strong tailwinds. It's a risk, for sure, but one that I believe is worth taking.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementBuy Tesla Inc.

It also is increasing other early-payout options promoting customer ownership.The company is now expecting FY18 per-share earnings in a range of $1.20 to $1.40 and revenue growing in the low-single percentage digits. That compares with the Capital IQ consensus projecting a $0.99 per share profit for the 12-month period beginning in July on revenue rising 1.9% over prior-year levels to around $2.82 billion.RCII shares were up slightly less than 6% at $10.17 each, previously topping out today at $10.50 a share.In other sector news,(+) TSLA, (+3.0%) Raised to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Jaffray.(-) SNOW, (-6.6%) Agrees to a $1.5 bln buyout offer, including assumed debt, from a new entity controlled by affiliates of the Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners, which will pay $23.75 in cash for each share of the company's stock."

Netflix, Inc. Stock Gets a Pat on the Back From Piper Jaffray (NFLX);4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) was racing in midday trading against the current of a reversing market, with the bulls clinging to a buy-call reiteration on NFLX stock from analysts at Piper Jaffray.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSpecifically, Piper reiterated its ""Overweight"" rating on Netflix shares, which include a $166 price target- some 15% higher from current prices. The impetus? The results of the 33rd semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens survey, which showed an upward trend in Netflix's popularity among teens.The question was, ""What percent of your time do you spend watching video across these platforms?"" Teens reported an average of 38% of their time spent on Netflix, versus 37% six months ago.We'll see whether a new ratings system does anything to buoy that figure in a few weeks. Netflix this month has launched a new rating system that uses ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" as indicators, moving away from the star methodology. Netflix itself seems a bit worried about the launch, going so far as to release a video explaining the new ratings system to viewers.Buy Tesla Inc. Stock Before the Ball REALLY Gets Rolling (TSLA)NFLX ditched the old system because it ended up moreso reflecting popularity rather than its ability to predict what viewers might want to watch.NFLX stock started Monday's trading in the red, but reversed hard amid news of the upgrade and is now well in the black. The bounce is coming off support at the 50-day moving average, which shares have been testing over the bast couple of weeks.Also, the 20-day MA is sitting just above the 50-day MA - something traders may be watching in the event that the 20-day crosses below, giving off a bearish signal.Investors also should keep their eyes out for Netflix's upcoming earnings report, which is due out after the close of trading on Monday, April 17.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Buy Tesla Inc. Stock Before the Ball REALLY Gets Rolling (TSLA);4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJust a little less than two weeks ago, I pointed out thatTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was in a better position for a breakout than it had been in years. If Tesla stock was going to work its way out of an annoying sideways rut, this was an opportunity its fans and followers couldn't afford to ignore.makeArticleAd();It looks like traders saw the same last week, and believed it enough to buy into it. TSLA has not only cleared the ceiling at $287 - it has followed through quite nicely without yet looking back. It looks like that old range between $179 and $287 really is in the rear-view mirror.What I didn't say then -just because of time and room constraints- was now that the stock's no longer shackled, it becomes infinitely easier for analysts to dish out new (or more) bullish opinions on Tesla stock. We saw what could become a string of upgrades on Monday morning … even if it a strangely-worded bullish thesis.The Ball Is RollingFirst things first.The chart of Tesla shares below largely speaks for itself. That is, since early 2014, TSLA has bounced around between $179 and $287. A minor floor at $195 also played an occasional role. Last week, though, with some help, Tesla stock finally pushed its way above a ceiling that had quelled a rally three different times over the prior two years.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilThe looming advent of the Model 3 and enthusiasm surrounding the newModel Yget most of the credit for the bullish thrust.Click to EnlargeIt matters more than you might think.As much as they'd like for you to believe otherwise, Wall Street's analysts watch charts as much as anybody else does, if not more so. There's nothing more damaging to their careers than deeming a stock a ""buy"" that doesn't move higher, or calling a particular stock a ""sell"" that doesn't move lower. If nothing else, a stock's chart trajectory helps the pros determine what's in store for a particular name.With that as the backdrop, last week's breakout move from TSLA stock just made it considerably easier for an already-bullish analyst community to raise their opinions on the electric vehicle and solar panel maker.Piper Jaffray was one of the first to pull the trigger, even if apologetically so.An Un-Upgrade on TSLA, But WhateverAt first glance, Piper Jaffray's upgrade from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy"" and the raised price target for Tesla stock from $223 to $368 seems like a fairly typical shift in sentiment. It was analyst Alexander Potter's explanation that left the market wondering if they should heed his advice. He noted:""Admittedly, before investors can follow our advice and buy TSLA shares, they will need to employ a ""creative"" valuation methodology and prepare for a bumpy ride.""Creative valuation? It gets better.Potter went on to say:""We sympathize with bears - but their (arguably rational) arguments probably won't matter. In many ways, TSLA seems to play by its own rules. The company burns through cash at a rate that better-established companies would likely be crucified for … Tesla's production timelines are unreasonably fast. … Yet, because of its superior products, loyal shareholders, and inspiring mission, TSLA remains unscathed.""To a new investor looking for a results-driven valuation, it's a maddening lack of results-based opinion. But trading veterans have a pretty good idea of what he means.While most stocks are driven by the underlying company's balance sheet and income statement, a handful of stocks - ""story"" stocks - are largely a bet on future sentiment regarding that company's basic premise.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of those names.I've said it before, but it merits repeating now: AMZN shares are supported almost entirely on the notion that it's so pervasive because it's woefully profitable. The average consumer/investor loves the idea of being able to buy anything and everything at the push of a button, and have it in their hands within a couple of days (if not sooner). The premise is more than enough to obscure the poor net margins Amazon habitually produces.Ditto for TSLA stock. Tesla burns through money like nobody's business and has a habit of overpromising and underdelivering. But it just doesn't matter. Electric cars are the future, and CEO Elon Musk makes them cool, not just EVs that look like go-carts.Apple Inc. Stock Will Correct Ahead of Q2 Earnings (AAPL)For Potter - and soon, I suspect, others - the premise is enough now that the stock's unstuck.Bottom Line for TSLA StockIt is what it is. Tesla stock may not be a great fit for grandma's retirement portfolio, but for investors that understand some stocks are more of a psychological chess match than an investment, TSLA can play a respectable role.Potter even goes on to say so without really saying so, commenting ""[the company's products] have a captivating impact on consumers and shareholders alike; this advantage will be difficult to replicate.""Don't overthink this one. Just go with the flow.

Own Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock for Growth AND Dividends;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) once again appears to be a forgotten success story, overlooked amid the recent dominant performances by the likes ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), which are all trading near all-time highs.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut investors who are looking for a potentialbreakout candidate, offering the combination of revenue growth and solid dividend, should look no further than Microsoft.Although MSFT stock, which closed Friday at $65.68, is not cheap, Microsoft can rally another 15% in the next 12 to 18 months, reaching $76 to $80 per share. And this rally can start as early this later this month, when the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant reports third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings.Microsoft Stock by the NumbersFor the quarter that ended in March, MSFT is expected to deliver earnings per share of 70 cents on revenue of $23.62 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 12.9% and 7%, respectively.For the full year, ending June, earnings are projected to rise 6.4% year over year to $2.97 per share, while revenue of $96.59 billion would mark a year-over-year increase of $4.9%.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?MSFT has risen 5.4% year to date, which trails, say, the 20%-plus gain Amazon has put up. This also compares to a 5% rise in theS&P 500index.But thanks to Microsoft's quick emergence in the cloud, which is also generating higher profit margins, Microsoft stock is poised to catch lightning. Worldwide spending on cloud computing services is expected to grow to $195 billion by 2020, According to technology market research firm IDC.Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which is now second only to Amazon's Amazon Web Services, is gaining greater adoption among Fortune-500 companies and is proven to be a growing threat in the space. Azure revenue surged a whopping 93% in the second quarter, compared to the year-ago period, while overall cloud applications and software grew 8%.Just as important, Microsoft's cloud strength, combined with advances in mobile applications, reduces its dependence on declining PC sales.Notably, second-quarter gross margins in its Commercial cloud business, which includes Azure and Office 365 product sold to businesses, reached 48% - up two percentage points year over year. This improved profit margin is an important metric analysts pay close attention to. And withLinkedInnow in the fold, Microsoft stock has yet another strong asset to push its cloud ambition even farther.Bottom Line for MSFT StockMSFT won't impress with breathtaking returns in the near term, but much of that has to do with Microsoft stock's massive size and scale, given its market cap is well over $500 billion. But with some $121 billion in cash on the balance sheet, the company is both a safe haven from the standpoint of the 2.4% yield and with its cloud prowess offering sustainable growth opportunities.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Retirement Stocks That No One Talks About10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideWhy GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Can Still Fight Harder Than You ThinkThe postOwn Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock for Growth AND Dividendsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

No Profits for Tesla This Year -- or Next Year Either, Warns Analyst;4/10/2017;"Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks,     downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do     these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today,     we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it     under the microscope...What do you do when one of the top analysts on the planet   slashes its earnings forecast for one of the most popular stocks   in America -- but then recommends buying the stock anyway, and   raises its price target 65%? I don't know about you, but I sit up   and pay attention.Because that's exactly what we're seeing this morning, as   investment bankerPiper Jaffray-- ranked in the top 20% of investors we track on   Motley Fool CAPS -- announced a new upgrade for shares ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock.makeArticleAd();Car buyers reserved Tesla's Model 3, some before even the     vehicle was unveiled. Investors may happily do the same withTesla stock. Image source: Getty Images.1. Upgrading TeslaHere's how the story goes. This morning, Piper Jaffray   announced the results of a seven-month road test it's conducted   on a Tesla electric car, and a parallel valuation test it's   conducted on Tesla stock. Its conclusion: Tesla stock deserves an   upgrade from neutral to overweight (aka buy).As detailed in twin reports onTheFly.comandStreetInsider.comthis morning, Piper says it's impressed with the car, and ""can't   ... ignore"" the stock any longer. In particular, Piper says it's   met with Tesla management and come away convinced that Tesla will   meet its goal of beginning deliveries of a Model 3 electric sedan   this year -- and the car's going to be a hit.2. Tesla's ""captivating impact""Actually, those aren't Piper's exact words. To be precise,   what the analyst said is that Tesla's electric cars have a   ""captivating impact on consumers and shareholders alike.""Which is good news for Tesla, because the price on this stock   just went a lot higher.3. Tesla by the numbersFollowing astrong Q1 deliveries reportlast month, Tesla stockgained 7% in a day, and hasn't looked back since. Now, you might think that the   initiation of Model 3 deliveries this year would add to that good   news, and maybe even drop some profits to Tesla's bottom line   ahead of schedule. (According to most analysts cited onS&P Global Market Intelligence, Tesla is expected to report its first full-year profit in 2019,   and its first pro forma profit in 2018.)Piper used to count itself among those optimistic analysts,   but after crunching the numbers carefully, and meeting with   management, Piper now warns investors to buckle up for a bumpy   ride. Piper predicts Tesla will run into production   inefficiencies in striving to fulfill its Model 3 promise, with   the result being that profits at the company will take a hit.   Instead of beginning to earn profits as early as Q3 of 2017   (Piper doesn't specify whether it's referring to pro forma   profits or the real, GAAP-calculated variety), the analyst now   believes Tesla will lose money in every single quarter of 2017,   and end this fiscal year with a $4.83-per-share loss -- versus   the $0.42-per-shareprofitit previously predicted.Furthermore, Piper expects Tesla to lose money in Q1 2018   ($0.88 per share) and Q2 2018 as well ($0.81), only turning   profitable -- finally -- in Q3 2018, one full year later than it   had previously hoped to see.And even then, Piper says Tesla will lose money for 2018 as a   whole -- $0.11 per share worth.So...sell Tesla, right?Put it all together, and what Piper Jaffray is predicting is   two more long years of no profits whatsoever coming out of Tesla   stock, and only a chance of the stock turning profitable in 2019.   For the record, that's also the year most other analysts on Wall   Street believe Tesla will finally turn profitable, and earn about   $0.20 per share in GAAP net profit.Despite all this, and despite the prospect of delayed   gratification, Piper insists Tesla stock is a buy. Employing what   by its own admission the analyst calls ""a 'creative' valuation   methodology,"" Piper argues that Tesla stock today -- at least two   years before it earns its first profit -- is worth $368 per   share. That's 65% more money than Piper previously thought Tesla   stock was worth. It also values the stock,today, at a simply astounding 1,840 times the profits that most   analysts believe that Tesla stock will earn...two years from   now.Does this sound like a crazy valuation? Yes, it does. Then   again, Tesla had no problem attractingpre-orders for 400,000 carsfrom buyers willing to wait a year (or longer) before they could   ever hope to see their new cars. Maybe Tesla investors will prove   willing to wait as long (or longer) to see their company earn a   profit.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Straight Path Communications Inc (STRP) Pops 150% on AT&T Inc.

The telecom giant announced on Monday that it would buy out Straight Path for $1.25 billion in stock, sending STRP stock up roughly 150% in morning trade.makeArticleAd();The deal values Straight Path at $95.63 per share, which means at current prices of nearly $90 per share, shares haven't yet fully baked in the acquisition price.The acquisition isn't a total surprise - Straight Path, which was spun off ofIDT Corporation(NYSE:IDT) in 2013, said back in January that it had hired Evercore Partners to explore ""strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value."" That announcement came a week after STRP agreed to pay $15 million and surrender certain licenses as part of a settlement with the FCC over filing misleading information while trying to earn license renewals.AT&T's deal is actually worth $1.6 billion, as it includes the FCC settlement amount, among other items.Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NOK) Stock: A Decent Dividend, But Not Much More;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Oyj(ADR)(NYSE:NOK) has been showing some signs of life lately. For the year so far, the shares have logged a gain of nearly 11%. So s there more upside with NOK stock? Don't count on it.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockKeep in mind that - for the past year - NOK has been undergoing a massive transformation. The key part of this was the $17 billion merger with Alcatel-Lucent.According to theannual reportfrom Nokia:""We started the year primarily as a mobile networks and patent licensing company. Today we are a fundamentally different company, with a complete portfolio that spans mobile, fixed, cable, routing, optical, standalone software, services, digital health, and VR, as well as licensing activities covering patents, brand, technology, and more.""All this is backed up with40,000 employees in R&D(which involves the legendary Bell Labs), 31,000 patents and operations in more than 100 countries. What's more, there are expected to be about $1.27 billion in cost synergies by next year.So all in all, things should be very promising for NOK stock, right? Perhaps so. But it could take some time for the major changes to have a real impact. For example, the industries that NOK is targeting - like virtual reality and the Internet of Things (IoT) - are still in the early phases.But more importantly, there will likely be sluggishness in the core networking business. The main reason: Telecom operators seem to be in no hurry to transition to 5G systems. Let's face it, this move demands tremendous capital costs. As a result, the focus will be on trying to get as much as possible from the existing networks.NOK has already acknowledged this. Keep in mind that the guidance is for there to be a drop of about2% this year.Nokia Stock And the ChallengesNOK must contend with a tough competitive environment. Just some of the rivals includeMotorola Solutions Inc(NYSE:MSI),Mitel Networks Corp(NASDAQ:MITL) andTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(NASDAQ:ERIC).Although, the low-cost Chinese operators may be the biggest threats, such asHuawei Technologies Co.Last year, the company saw its revenues jump by32% to $75.1 billionand the earnings came to $5.3 billion. NOK, on the other hand, posted revenues of $24.9 billion and suffered a net loss of $978 million.OK, so what about the Nokia 3310 phone? What might this mean for NOK stock? Actually, the retro strategy looks spot-on - and the demand for the phone appears to be considerable.Yet there are some notable drawbacks. Consider that the Nokia 3310 phone is only available on 2G networks, which limits the market potential. There is also no integration withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp. This is important since many people in foreign markets must pay for SMS.Something else: NOK will only be getting licensing revenues, which may ultimately come to a couple bucks per phone. In other words, even if the it is a hit with customers, the financial impact may not necessarily be significant.Bottom Line on NOK StockIt's encouraging that Nokia is making bold moves. And this is not just about with the Alcatel-Lucent merger. NOK has also made some interesting acquisitions, such as in the telehealth space. Oh, and the Nokia 3310 shows that the company is pushing innovation.Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When It Returns to RealityBut again, all these are long-term initiatives. True, NOK stock is paying a hefty 3.5%, which is certainly at the high-end for the tech . Yet for investors, this may be the where much of the return will come from for the next few years, not necessarily from sustainable capital gains.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookas well asOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools & services for employee stock options of pre/post IPO companies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

How to Trade Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) Stock Before Earnings;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe charts of airline stocks look almost like bank stocks. Airlines have enjoyed a massive rally into 2017 from ultra-low levels. But even at their highest recent highs, the carriers' valuations didn't look too bad. For instance,Delta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) doesn't exactly look like a screaming short when DAL stock is trading around 8 times trailing earnings.makeArticleAd();Source:via DeltaHowever, Delta earnings are coming up Wednesday before the bell, and I want to short the event. I'm not dissing the company's fundamentals - I just want to make a bet based on short-term price action.Fundamentally, the industry seems to have streamlined its operations, working on what appears to be good capacity levels. Just this morning, we learned of aUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL) viral video where a flight was overbooked to the point that they literally had to drag a paying passenger off their plane.Of course, Delta itself is having some operational problems on the back of massive storms that hit the company's main hub in Atlanta. The airline has had to cancel several thousand flights since Wednesday, and the thought is that while much can be laid on the storms, DAL has flubbed parts of the recovery.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The opportunity I see here, however, is in the technicals of DAL stock. Prices are trying to hang on to $45 per share, but if it fails, sellers could be invited for a retest of $43.25.Click to EnlargeAs noted, I think airlines are operating lean and mean, so that gives us a floor against which we can sell downside risk to finance a near-term bearish bet. Or, in layman's terms, we can bet bearishly against Delta for free.How to Trade DAL StockThe Trade:Buy the April $45/$44 debit put spread for 35 cents per contract. This is the maximum amount we can lose. We need Delta stock to fall below our spread for a chance to more than double our money. I chose a near-the-money spread so we only need to guess direction - not thesizeof the move - to profit. (The options markets are pricing in a move of plus or minus $1.60 on earnings this week.)To mitigate our risk, we'll eliminate the out-of-pocket expense by selling bullish premium below proven support levels.Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When It Returns to RealityThe Bank:Sell the 26 May $40 put and collect 50 cents per contract. This is a bullish trade that has an 85% theoretical chance of expiring for maximum gains. As long as DAL stays above our sold strike, any premium we recover from the bought April put position would be profit.Selling naked options is risky, so only do this if you're willing and able to own DAL stock at that price. But again, Delta has a healthy P&L, so an entry point at a 10% discount from here sounds attractive to me.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3here.

Is a Factory Part of Tesla's (TSLA) Expansion Plan in China?;4/10/2017;"Rumors ofTesla, Inc.TSLAbuilding a factory in China have surfaced once again. Southern Metropolis Daily, a local Guangdong province newspaper, has claimed (citing sources) that the company plans to independently fund and construct a factory in the region.Per the report, Tesla has already approved a site for the facility and is awaiting the green signal from the local government. The report also speculated that the project will be announced within a year if the plan proceeds smoothly.However, the electric vehicle producer has denied the report, as told to CNBC. Tesla reiterated its commitment to the Chinese market, the second largest auto market globally, but stated that the plans outlined per the report are untrue.Tesla in ChinaAs the report noted, a manufacturing unit in China would help Tesla reduce its border tax. Recently, Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.TCEHYpurchased a 5% stake or 8.17 million shares in the company for $1.8 billion, making it the fifth largest shareholder and paving a way for Tesla's further expansion in China. Tencent, also based in Guangdong, stated that the companies currently do not have any cooperative plans but may work together in the future.Tesla's market in China is significantly growing. The company saw its annual revenues from the country increase more than three times to over $1.06 billion in 2016, making it second only to revenues from the U.S. China imported 11,839 Tesla vehicles in 2016, five times more than the previous year. It has 24 stores and 348 regular charging stations in the country.Regulatory RequirementsWhile rumors of Tesla building a factory in China appear repeatedly, a number of problems may also hinder the company in making this a reality. China has a policy requiring foreign auto manufacturers to set up joint ventures with local companies to produce vehicles. Moreover, the foreign manufacturers cannot own more than 50% in the venture. Therefore, it isn't clear whether the government would approve a plant owned independently by a foreign automaker.Rumors of a factory being set up by Tesla in partnership with other local companies have surfaced in the past. All of them have been subsequently denied by Tesla.PerformanceTesla outperformed the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry over the last three months. During the period, Tesla gained 31.6% while the industry witnessed a 0.6% rise. The outperformance has been supported by expansion plans and higher deliveries in first-quarter 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked companies in the auto space include American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.AXLand Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc.ALSN.

Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When It Returns to Reality;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, Goldman Sachs started new analytical coverage ofAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) at a ""sell,"" suggesting the stock had rallied too far, too fast. Judging from the 6% tumble AMD stock took that day, the market didn't see it coming.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSee, as far as traders were concerned, the 430% gain that Advanced Micro dished out over the prior 12 months implies that traders felt the development of theRyzencomputer processor and theVegagraphics processor were going to put the company back on a growth track. Goldman Sachs' thoughtscalled their whole logic into question.Does Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari have a point? He does. More than that, though, Hari serves up an important reminder that a stock and the underlying company aren't always necessarily one and the same.Yes, AMD Stock Is OvervaluedHari specifically feels Advanced Micro Devices isovervalued to the tune of 236%based on a plausible projection of sales over the course of the coming five years. He finds the stock's valuation is ""difficult to justify"" simply because it's ""priced to perfection,"" and then some.Once rivalsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) turn it into a price war, the ugly reality of this overvalued name could take a real toll.That's why Hari believes AMD stock worth just $11 per share. That's more than 18% less than last week's closing price. And, with a forward-looking (2018) price-to-earnings ratio of 45.1, his stance sounds less and less crazy.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?It all begs the question: How in the world did AMD shares get in this condition in the first place?The simplest answer is: human nature.But Advanced Micro DevicesIson TargetYes, you own a stock not for where the company is, but where the company is going to be six to 24 months down the road. It's not always easy to make a reasonable long-term guesstimate, but most traders do it well enough most of the time.There are times, however, when common sense seems to get thrown out the window and investors decide today's a good day to buy simply because there's no bad news today. There's been no (relative) bad news from or about AMD stock for months now - because the company has been in regroup mode - and traders remained in buy mode without ever stopping to realize they've been in perpetual buy mode since April of last year. Hari only pointed that out.It's not the first time investors have needed to be reminded a stock can't rise forever on a company's ""promising future."" Sooner or later, the future has to arrive and justify a frothy valuation. That future for Advanced Micro Devices is still a little too far off to keep the stock propped up at these levels.That being said, the stock/company relationship is still a two-way street. A falling stock doesn't necessarily mean the underlying company is doomed. It's simply a matter of aligning a stock's price and a company's potential. Several observers still feel good about AMD (the company).Barron's Tiernan Ray is one of those optimists.Ray recently wrote:""My colleague Teresa Rivas has anice summary of the Goldman argument, and Barron's positive view in contrast. The gist is that Hari is right about all the risks, which have always been there. But the stock is not priced expensively, as Hari implies, if one believes the company can take significant market share back from Intel (INTC) and possibly Nvidia (NVDA).In hours of conversation with CEO Lisa Su, CTO Mark Papermaster, and other executives, I did get a sense of a company with a more sober sense of purpose than in past days. I think the seriousness with which management recognizes both the opportunities and the risks is a meaningful factor. The company is aware that in past AMD fumbled leads it obtained. It is committed as an organization not to do so again.""All fair points.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)But, even Ray's commentary has a big ""if"" in it: If Advanced Micro Devices can steal market share back from INTC and NVDA. The consensus is, Nvidia and Intel are ready to go to war.Bottom LineI'll repeat something I said back on March 10:""Don't confuse any future weakness from AMD as evidence of what's in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanced Micro Devices is very well positioned for a great 2017. The trick is just being patient enough to wait for a truly palatable entry price. That could still be well below the recent low.In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it's almost uncomfortable to do so. We aren't there yet.""We still aren't there yet. I'm not even sure a retreat to Hari's target of $11 would get us all the way there. It's still a compelling company though.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Hurts, But Here's Why I'm Still a BelieverTrade of the Day: Citigroup (NYSE:C)7 Utility Stocks That Will Crack Your Nest EggThe postBuy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Should Have You Salivating;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) on Friday, April 7, rose a little more than 2% on the day. More importantly, WMT stock scored a marginal technical breakout in the short-term.makeArticleAd();While many market participants remain skeptical of Walmart's ability to break higher from here, the charts have been more constructive than they have for alongtime.When I hold my twice-weekly calls with my inner circle of hedge funds and institutional investors, the topic of WMT stock versusAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) comes up at least half of the time. The posturing of many of these investors remains clearly in favor of AMZN stock given the behemoth's amazing track record of taking over the lead in many areas of retail and beyond.While I certainly believe in Amazon's ability to continue to innovate and grow, and while I believe in Amazon shares long-term, Walmart is doing a few good things of its own. It's not only improving its physical stores, but meaningfully expanding its online platform.When I last discussed WMT shares on Feb. 27, I said the stockcould be a pleasant surprise for 2017. Specifically, I near-term pointed to the $72.50 level and said if and when it could be overcome on a daily closing basis, a next upside target in the mid-$70s would open up, followed by the high $70s or low $80s as next possible upside targets. Until last Friday, Walmart hadn't been able to overcome $72.50 on a daily basis.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?Now, it's time to update this trade idea.WMT Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that ever since breaking below its red 200-week simple moving average in the summer of 2015, Walmart has respected it as technical resistance.Click to EnlargeNote that this area around the $72-$73 levels also allows us to draw a simple line of horizontal resistance. If and when this area can be overcome on a weekly closing basis, it may turn into technical support.On the daily chart, we see that the corrective phase Walmart had been in from August 2016 into January of this year has carved out a bullish pattern that could be looked at in several ways.Click to EnlargeOne way is to look at the price action as a big bullish flag formation that, with a breakout above $70 in February, has already given us bullish confirmation of a move higher. Another way is to note the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern marked by the three blue triangles, which also points to a move into the high $70s or low $80s over time.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)Last Friday WMT stock broke past horizontal resistance around $72.50 that had been firmly in place since September 2016 and thus may have ignited a move into the mid to high $70s for now.Any bearish reversal that sees WMT st0ck close back below $71 would be a stop-loss signal for any swing trades long.Like what you see?

Alibaba (BABA) Can Still Return 27 Percent: Analysts;4/10/2017;"Alibaba (Shutterstock photo)Investors who are looking for a potential breakout candidate should now consider Alibaba (BABA), which has the potential to rally an additional 27%, according to Raymond James analysts Aaron Kessler and Justin Patterson.In the midst of dominant performances by the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL), which are all trading at near to all-time highs, Alibaba has been a forgotten success story. The stock, which has (quietly) risen 24% year to date, closed Friday at $108.99. This compares to a 5% rise in the S&P 500 index. And if you’ve held BABA stock over the past year, you’re up an impressive 40%, against a 15% rise for the S&P 500. But don’t even think about selling yet.makeArticleAd();On Friday, while citing the the continued strength of the Alibaba’s core e-commerce business which the analysts expect to achieve higher revenues and profit margin, Kessler and Patterson reiterated their Strong Buy rating on BABA stock and boosted their price target to $138, suggesting potential premiums of 27%. Alibaba’s profit margins, which at one point was a source of concern for investors, is now one of the company’s key advantages.The Chinese e-commerce giant in January not only posted a 54% jump in its third quarter revenue, Alibaba beat on the bottom line by a whopping 17 cents, underscoring the extent to which analysts had misjudged how quickly founder/executive chairman Jack Ma and CEO Daniel Zhang can accelerate the company’s profit margins. It would seem Kessler and Patterson now want to get ahead of the quarter.“According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, online sales of consumer goods in January-February increased 25.5% year on year (vs. 25.6% y/y in 2016),” the analysts wrote in a research note Friday,accordingto Barron’s. Alibaba will report fourth quarter results in the first week of May. “For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we have modeled Alibaba China commerce revenue growth of 33% in local currency (vs. 42% last quarter given a 500 basis point, tougher comparison) though we believe our estimate could prove conservative,” the analysts wrote.Beyond the strength of the core e-commerce business, the analysts are also bullish about Alibaba’s fast-growing cloud segment, which in the third quarter grew 115%. The analysts expect Alicloud paying customers to reach 1 million by the end of fiscal year 2018, which would mark a 31% rise from fiscal 2016. This would Alicloud on a path to eventually challenge Amazon and Microsoft (MSFT) for cloud dominance.All told, when evaluating the prospects of Alibaba, there is still plenty of to be excited about, especially when factoring the company’s ability to curtail losses in its investment areas such as digital media. And while $138 per share is certainly an confident target by Raymond James, BABA stock is still well-positioned to reach my target of $150, which would yield 37% in the next 12 to 18 months."

3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL);4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA Good Friday-shortened week begins today, and will eventually ramp up near the end with a slate of bank earnings. Overseas, the new week kicked off with Japanese stocks posting gains, but European stocks heading broadly lower. U.S. futures are ticking slightly higher this morning.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Monday has no shortage of big stocks making headlines, withTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andDelta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) all finding themselves in the spotlight this morning.Here's what you should know heading into Monday's trade:Tesla Inc (TSLA)TSLA shares are pushing even higher into all-time-high territory this morning on a bizarre note from Piper Jaffray in which the firm significantly slashed Tesla's earnings estimates, but upgraded and slapped a much higher price target on the stock.Piper analyst Alex Potter - who said he and his team have been driving a Tesla around for seven months to better educate themselves - cleaved the company's estimates for full-year 2017, previously expecting profits of 42 cents per share, but now expecting a loss of $4.83. That includes dramatic quarterly changes, such as the upcoming Q1 estimate, which is being hacked from a 12-cent loss to 78 cents of red ink.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?Potter also predicts an 11-cent loss for full-year 2018; he previously did not have any earnings estimates on the stock.Despite this change in heart, however, Potter also advised clients to ""employ a 'creative' valuation methodology and prepare for a bumpy ride,"" and proceeded to upgrade TSLA shares from ""Neutral"" to ""Overweight."" He also jacked up the price target from $223 to $368 - a roughly 22% increase from Friday's closing price of $302.54.TSLA shares are currently up roughly 2% in Monday's premarket trade, pushing shares even further into the stratosphere. The stock finally pushed up and out of a multiyear trading range last week, and is setting a new string of highs that appears will continue today.UPDATE:With Monday's push, Tesla passedGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization. TSLA currently is worth $51.4 billion, while GM is worth $50.3 billion.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)Google parent Alphabet is in hot water after weekend allegations by the Department of Labor that the company pays women less than men with the same experience on the same job.The U.S. Department of Labor launched an investigation - which is not yet complete - into the tech giant, with regional director Janette Wipper saying there is a ""systemic compensation disparities against women"" at the company. The DoL also says that Google refused to hand over job and salary information to the office of federal contract compliance programs - a violation of its contract with the federal government.The Silicon Valley entityresponded on Sundaywith a statement denying such allegations. Google said it does a robust examination of wages across genders and found no gender gap.""Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn't provided any data, or shared its methodology,"" the company wrote.GOOGL shares are trading around breakeven on Monday morning, and are up about 7% year-to-date.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)Delta's wave of delays and cancellations have extended into a fifth day following storms that battered the airline's main hub in Atlanta.Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Hurts, But Here's Why I'm Still a BelieverDelta has been forced to ax more than 3,300 flights since Wednesday, when storms hit Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. However, while the storms did cause some damage, the company also is being criticized for its own slow response, as well as internal regulations that may have exacerbated the problem.Sunday marked the fifth day of troubles for the carrier, which had to cancel at least 150 flights yesterday, but the company continues to be held up by rules including how long pilots and flight attendants can staff planes.Naturally, passenger stories are bubbling up - from tales of flights being cancelled, then rebookings cancelled, to even a tale about how one woman's familybrought in $11,000by continuously giving up their tickets to Delta to service standby passengers.Still, DAL stock is primed to open Monday's trading up more than 2%.More From InvestorPlace10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideThe 10 Best ETFs to Buy for the Rest of 2017The 10 Cheapest Vanguard Funds on the MarketThe post3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Hurts, But Here’s Why I’m Still a Believer;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet me be blunt right from the beginning -Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) is a bigly disappointment. Even Press Secretary Sean Spicer couldn't talk his way out of the ugliness of FIT stock. Year-to-date, Fitbit shares are down 24% in the markets. Obviously, that means that the company has to have a stellar run from here on out just to break even!makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitTo many folks (including me), it wasn't supposed to be like this. FIT stock was a breath of fresh air for a whole number of reasons.You can start with the leadership. Fitbit CEO James Park doesn't fit the mold of your typical Wall Street boss, and I think that's great! He seems to really care about his organization, and how he can return value for FIT stock investors. Apparently, he has yet to finish his degree at Harvard College, so he's not an education snob, either.That quirkiness and lively ""can-do"" personality is evident in FIT products. For example, rather than naming their products with generic, alphanumerical codes, Fitbit dug a little deeper in thecreative department. Offerings such as ""Alta,"" ""Charge"" and ""Surge"" are self-defined and help clarify what their mission purpose is. These attributes also contributed to memorable marketing campaigns - a big plus for Fitbit stock.Sales Decline Truly Hurt FIT StockOf course, things almost always work better in your head. And while the fundamentals were supportive of FIT stock, the markets had their own say.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The biggestimpedimentto Fitbit stock is sales. Simply put, FIT is no longer the toast of Wall Street. Back in 2012, for instance, the company registered $76 million in sales. A year later, that figure jumped to $271 million, or a near-257% gain. Most remarkable of all, it only took two years from there to hit the billion-dollar benchmark. When it did so, it was threatening$2 billion, not $1 billion.But in fiscal 2016, FIT stock could only muster less than $2.2 billion in revenue. Against the banner year of 2015, that's only a 17% gain. But sales growth between 2013 and the end of 2015 averaged almost 200%. You can see the day-and-night dichotomy here. And if you can see it, so too can the professional traders and hedge fund managers.The problem wasn't just limited to a one-off occurrence. Sometimes, the markets are charitable, or at least forgiving. The issue became what was at stake. Fitbit products began looking awfully commoditized, which was the kiss of death forGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO).Not wanting to repeat that mistake, investors quickly dumped out of Fitbit stock.I can understand their concerns, but here's a thought: if Fitbit is commoditized, aren't all consumer electronic companies likeApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),Sony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE), andSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) also commoditized?The point is not whether commoditization is occurring - it is. Rather, it's the potential for future business. And this is why I'm still bullish on FIT stock.Potential Demand for Fitbit Products Is Huge!In a previous article about Fitbit stock, I mentioned that Americans love theirgym memberships.Good times or bad, we head to fitness centers across the country. Logically, we can deduce that people will also open their wallets for fitness-related accessories. That's a net positive for FIT stock, no matter how you cut it.Still, the gym membership factor only considers those who are currently involved in fitness regiments. Outside of that group lies an enormous pool of potential Fitbit customers. According to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, ""Less than 5%of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day."" Furthermore, ""only one in three adults receive the recommended amount of physical activity each week.""In other words, FIT stock may be levered to a commoditized product, but there is great demand for it. After all, fitness is the cheapest and most effective way to promote healthy living and reduce overall healthcare costs. If more education about fitness concerns proliferate, the debate about ""Obamacare"" may finally simmer down.How to Short Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for FreeFinally, what makes Fitbit stock stand out at this juncture is the economy. It's not as great as President Donald Trump wants it to be, but it's getting there. If people were already spending money on gym memberships when the economy was pedestrian, imagine what they may do as it improves.You can't necessarily make the same argument about other consumer electronic devices. Nobody needs to have another camera, or the latest smartphone. But humans absolutely need at least a modicum of physical activity. Fitbit devices helps people achieve their personal fitness goals, and the current environment is quite conducive. Therefore, I see good things ahead for FIT stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE stock.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for Years10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideCruise to Free Income from Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe postFitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Hurts, But Here's Why I'm Still a Believerappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Edmunds Predicts an EV Crash. Should Tesla Be Scared?;4/9/2017;"Edmunds has some potentially terrible news for the nascent   market for electric vehicles. In anew report(link opens a PDF), industry analysts at the automotive   researcher predict that the upcoming expiration of federal tax   incentives could utterly destroy the EV market. In no uncertain   terms, Edmunds predicts, ""Without these credits, this market is   likely to crash."" Ouch.The underlying rationale for that grim assessment is a case   studio of the EV market in Georgia, which looks at how EV sales   fared before and after the state's EV tax credit ($5,000) expired   a couple of years ago. As a product category, EVs saw their   market share decimated after the state tax credit expired.   Georgia's share of U.S. EVs fell from 17% to just 2% following   the expiration. Extrapolating the impacts, Edmunds concludes that   we may see the same play out on the national level once the   federal credit expires. President Trump is a notorious climate   denier and champion of coal, but the idea of eliminating the   credits prematurely is probably more trouble than it's worth.   What's more likely is that Donald Trump and a Republican Congress   simply won't renew them.Model S. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();As the dominant domestic player in EVs, shouldTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) be scared?The Leaf does not speak for everyoneNaturally, Tesla is included in the Georgia market. Just as   expected is that Tesla's unit sales comprise a small minority,   given high price points and premium positioning. There's another   vehicle that effectively dominated the market though: theNissanLeaf. It's not an exaggeration to say that the Georgia EV market   more or less lived or died by the Leaf. Citing IHS Markit,   Edmunds points out that the Tesla Model S saw a more minor dip   following the credit's expiration, and then rebounded ""within a   few months."" The Leaf did not recover.Image source: IHS Markit via Edmunds.Here's the thing: The underlying data of the report speaks   primarily of the Leaf. The Leaf has been declining in both   relevance and competitiveness as a product for a few years now.   Nissan was certainly a first mover in EVs, but the company didn't   continue investing aggressively to improve things such as range   or battery degradation. The DC fast-charging standard that Nissan   championed, CHAdeMO, is also in decline. There's an entirely new   breed of EVs on the horizon, including the Model 3, that can   offer twice the range of the Leaf at almost the same price point.General Motors' Chevy Bolt is here; GM has already sold roughly 3,600 units in   the U.S. since launching last year, and the geographical rollout   is ongoing.The Bolt and Model 3 are arguably the first mainstream,   affordable EVs that can offer 200 miles of range or more, a key   psychological threshold for consumers to alleviate range anxiety.   Extrapolating the Leaf's declining performance, some of which is   undoubtedly attributable to the credit expiration in Georgia, to   other superior EVs nationwide is a tenuous argument.Deal breaker?Edmunds points to the historical underperformance of EVs too,   citing President Obama's famous prediction that there would be 1   million EVs in the U.S. by 2015. The market fell far short of   this target for a number of reasons, but consider that Tesla   currently has about 400,000 Model 3 reservations in hand --   singlehandedly representing 40% of Obama's target from 2011.Some of these Model 3 buyers will receive the federal tax   credit; Tesla is expected to hit the 200,000 threshold that   triggers the phase-out in early 2018. But a meaningful percentage   of these customers should have no illusions of receiving the   credit; it's unclear how many are actually basing their   purchasing decision on the credit and whether the credit is a   deal breaker for them.@nickbaumI believe so- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)March 24, 2017Even without the credit, the average sales price of a car in   the U.S. is right around $35,000, so it's not unreasonable to   price a compelling EV at that price point with no additional   incentives. Tesla's reservation tally for the Model 3 shows   beyond a doubt that there is meaningful demand for the right EV   at the right price and could very well pick up where the Leaf   left off in carrying the EV market. Demand is not the issue here;   the biggest challenge for the time being will be ramping up   manufacturing to satisfy that demand.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

General Motors vs. Tesla Stock: Why GM Will Win;4/9/2017;"Shares of electric-car pioneerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have rocketed higher by 65% since the beginning of   December, after two and a half years of up-and-down performance.   This big jump reflectsgrowing anticipationfor Tesla's upcoming Model 3 sedan, continued strong sales for   its pricey Model S and Model X vehicles, and improving investor   confidence regarding Tesla's other green energy ventures.Tesla's huge rally has boosted its market cap to about $49   billion, even though the company is still unprofitable. That   figure puts it ahead of No. 2 U.S. automakerFord Motor. Tesla is now closing in on industry leaderGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) $51 billion market cap.makeArticleAd();Tesla stockprice and market cap growth; data byYCharts.Barring a huge setback, Tesla is almost certain to surpass   GM's market cap eventually, and it will probably be soon.   Nevertheless, General Motors is a better bet for investors --   even those with a long-term mindset.Tesla has been on a rollThere's no doubt that Tesla has been firing on all cylinders   in the past few months. In the company's most recent earnings   report, Tesla revealed that orders for the Model S and Model X   combined were up 49% year over year in Q4. It also confirmed that   it is on track to begin limited production of the new Model 3 in   July.Tesla reported more good news last week, announcing that it   built 25,418 vehicles during the first quarter and delivered just   over 25,000. That was important, because while Tesla has never   had trouble selling cars, production snafus have been a recurring   problem.If Tesla is finally ironing out its operations, that's a very   good sign for shareholders. CEO Elon Musk envisions building 1   million vehicles annually within a few years, way above the   record of 76,230 deliveries reached last year. Achieving that   goal (or even getting close) will require Tesla to master the   complexities of mass production.Tesla is gearing up to start production of the Model 3     sedan. Image source: Tesla.But cash flow matters -- a lotNotwithstanding Tesla's strong growth trajectory, the company   is still losing money and burning cash at a rapid rate. Tesla has   had to raise capital repeatedly in the past few years by selling   more shares and raising debt (mainly convertible notes).By contrast, General Motors has become extremely profitable.   In 2016, it generated a record adjusted operating profit of $12.5   billion and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $6.9 billion.   While investors seem to be very worried that U.S. auto sales have   peaked, GM's management has said the company will produce EPS of   $6.00-$6.50 this year, in line with or slightly higher than   last year's record mark of $6.12.General Motors' strong earnings and cash flow have allowed the   company to start returning lots of cash to investors. GM stock   has a strong dividend yield above 4%. Furthermore, the company   has spent more than $6 billion on share buybacks over the past   two years and plans to repurchase another $5 billion of stock in   2017.GM's cash flow trajectory may be bumpy going forward, but it   is well positioned to increase its free cash flow over the next   five to 10 years. First, the company's decision to jettison its   money-losing European operations will improve its annual free   cash flowby about $1 billion.GM's decision to sell its Opel/Vauxhall division will boost     its free cash flow. Image source: General Motors.Second, General Motors is in the early stages of a long-term   plan to move all of its vehicles to as few as four major   platforms (or ""vehicle sets"") to reduce costs. If this effort   succeeds, it could reduce GM's annual capex requirements further,   boosting free cash flow. That situation would allow it to return   even more cash to shareholders.Focus on total return, not market capMany investors seemingly fail to appreciate the fact that GM   is returning more and more cash to shareholders, while Tesla is   steadily issuing more shares to fund its growth.There's nothing wrong with either capital allocation strategy,   per se. General Motors is a mature company, so it's appropriate   for it to focus on generating free cash flow and returning most   of that cash to shareholders. By contrast, Tesla is still in the   early innings of its growth, so it's quite sensible for the   company to be investing heavily to drive future growth.However, this distinction means that investors shouldn't be   comparing changes in the two companies' market caps. Instead,   they should be focusing on GM and Tesla shares' total return,   including dividends.Thanks to its frequent share issuances, Tesla's market cap has   nearly doubled in the past three years, while GM's market cap has   declined. But on a total return basis, Tesla's lead over GM is   much smaller -- and it was trailing by a significant margin just   a few months ago.Tesla vs. General Motors market cap and total return   performance; data byYCharts.General Motors stock currently trades at a depressed price   because investors are extremely pessimistic about its long-term   prospects. Conversely, Tesla stock has a lofty valuation because   of investors' optimism about its growth trajectory.However, in the very long run, free cash flow drives share   price performance. Every year General Motors generates strong   free cash flow and returns it to shareholders, existing GM   shareholders will get a bigger proportional stake in this cash   machine. Every year Tesla issues more shares, investors see their   stake in the company's future profits decrease.This gives GM a huge advantage over Tesla in the long run from   an investing standpoint. If the company's initiatives to become   more efficient and increase its cash flow are even halfway   effective, General Motors stock is likely to deliver bigger gains   for investors than Tesla stock over the next five to 10 years.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

What Investors Missed in the Market This Week;4/8/2017;"Surprisingly, the markets were mostly able to shake off a   couple of developments that often send the market instantly   spiraling lower. President Donald Trump ordered an air strike on   Syria, and then the markets were hit with the weakest jobs report   in nearly a year. More specifically, The Labor Department   announced the U.S. created just 98,000 jobs in March compared to   estimates that called for 185,000 new jobs.The markets shook off those factors until the last couple of   hours of trading, when a minor sell-off occurred. With that   aside, let's look at some highlights from companies making big   moves, or positive headlines, this week.makeArticleAd();PNRA Pricedata byYCharts.A quick escalationShares ofPanera Bread Company(NASDAQ: PNRA) jumped early in the week due to rumors that the   company could potentially be bought out by a number of suitors. A   couple of days later, that potential became reality when it was   announced that the fast-casual chain agreed to a deal with JAB   Holdings for $7.5 billion, including $340 million in debt -- the   equivalent of $315 per share -- which immediately sent its stock   price near the deal price.What's in it for JAB Holdings, you ask? Despite trading near   all-time highs, Panera bread is still attractive, thanks to its   leading loyalty program engagement (roughly half of   transactions), increased delivery potential and capabilities, and   consistent menu innovations that are taking advantage of an   increased focus on health and wellness. Those factors all   combined to help Panera deliver comparable-store sales gains of   5.3% during the first quarter.Image source: Getty Images.What's in it for Panera, you ask? Well, for one, it gets rid   of investors in the public domain, which Panera CEO Ron Shaich   said takes up much of his time. Rumor has it that JAB Holdings   will be a hands-off type of owner, leaving management with   increased capacity to work on improving its business out of the   public spotlight.What's in it for the consumer? It's business as usual, and if   this all works out as intended, you'll probably end up enjoying   your nearest Panera products even more.On fire, in a good wayShares of medical device companyNovoCure(NASDAQ: NVCR) started the week absolutely on fire, opening more   than 60% higher after reporting multiple clinical-trial updates.   The company reported its phase 2 Panova study, which was testing   a combination of NovoCure's Optune plus standard care   chemotherapies for treating advanced pancreatic cancer -- and the   results were solid. The trial showed that adding Optune more than   doubled progression-free survival and one-year survival rates,   and now it's on to a phase 3 trial.Another big success came from NovoCure's Stellar trial, also   studying the combination of Optune with standard care, testing   treatment for malignant mesothelioma. The one-year survival rate   was a staggering 50% higher in patients using the combination   compared to control data. And these were just two of the positive   trials announced, and all the data was thoroughly encouraging to   investors, who have watched the stock shed roughly 60% of its   value -- before this week's jump -- since its 2015 Initial Public   Offering.Shorts feel the painShares ofTesla Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) were up 6% during intraday Monday trading, and up   almost 9% for the full week after announcing record deliveries   and production in the first quarter. The company shipped more   than 25,000 vehicles during the quarter, which was higher than   analysts' estimates calling for 24,200, and puts the company on   pace to hit its first-half target of 50,000 units. Tesla's   delivery mix was 13,450 Model S sedans and 11,550 Model X   crossovers, with production checking in at 25,418 units.""It's all about the Model 3 right now, but this is very good   news,"" Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., toldAutomotive News. ""25,000 units is the best we could have thought, and people are   looking at Model 3 for growth.""What's wild about Tesla's valuation, which is getting tougher   to defend, is that its market capitalization of $49 billion is   now higher than Ford's $44 billion. But despite this, the young   automaker remains largely unproven with high production levels,   and that's what investors will continue to watch as we approach   the Model 3 launch.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How to Short Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Free;4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) put together an incredible 400% rally over a 12-month period. While AMD stock is recovering on Friday, up nearly 1% before the close, it has given some of that back. But if you bought at the lows, you're a happy customer.makeArticleAd();Source: AMDTherein lies the challenge.When stocks get this hot, they become almost impossible to enter long with conviction. At any point along the 400%-plus rally, AMD shares would have seemed overextended, thereby keeping most investors out waiting for a dip that never came. Shorting it along the way was even scarier.To avoid this, I used options to make entry points relatively easy. For instance, in early December,I laid out a bullish tradeon Advanced Micro Devices that paid well with no money out-of=pocket. Today, I will share how I can do the opposite using the same methods.I won't spend much time arguing AMD's fundamentals. The world is becoming extremely dependent on tech and AMD is one of few suppliers to the brains of the machines that run them. There is enough business to fuel the success of it and others likeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC).3 Stocks That Aren't Sweating a Syria ConflictAlso, before you get too filled with rage, realize that I'm not shorting the company's prospects. I'm merely bettering on price action in AMD stock. In fact, I'm leveraging the perceived value in Advanced Micro to finance my bet.How to Trade AMD Stock HereThe Trade:Buy the May $13 put for $1 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. Technically, AMD stock looks perched at a must-bounce level that, if lost, could retest $12.20.Click to EnlargeTo reduce my out-of-pocket exposure, I will use fundamentals for balance.The Bank:Sell the Oct $11 put and collect $1.30 per contract. Here, I have a 60% theoretical chance of expiring for maximum gains. But if AMD stock falls below my sold put, I would be committed to buying it at $11 even if it falls lower.Cruise to Free Income from Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockTaking both trades resulted in a 30-cent net credit. So as long as AMD stock stays above $11 through mid-October, I will be profitable even if Advanced Micro Devices rallies to new highs. Any premiums I recover from selling the May puts would be incremental profits.Effectively, I am being paid to short AMD.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3here.

STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) (STM) Stock Is a Stealthy Giant;4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSTMicroelectronics NV (ADR)(NYSE:STM) is finally getting its time in the sun. This maker of components and integrated circuits isn't a consumer brand as much as it is a mainstay in almost all facets of consumer and industrial tech products.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnd what that boils down to is that this Swiss company is a major player in the massive Internet of Things transition, as well as inventory and production monitoring technologies.On the consumer side, you have companies likeNintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY) that areusing its motion sensors and touch screen integrated circuitsin its new Switch console/handheld hybrid. On the industry side, you have cutting edge firms likeMicrovision, Inc.(NASDAQ:MVIS) partnering with STM to develop laser beam scanning technology to enhance products for augmented and virtual reality, as well as pico projectors (tiny digital projectors that can fit in your hand).These are just a couple typical deals that STM has been in engaged in for decades. But the compelling thing about STM now is, the tech it has been building and perfecting, it's time has come.3 Bank Stocks to Trade Without Spending a DimeWhat's the Big Deal?For many years, people talked about how RFIDs (radio frequency identification) was going to be a massive game changer. But that revolution became more of an evolution once the global financial crisis hit. RFID circuits are used to track goods more efficiently than traditional methods.For example, say there is a container ship arriving in port. If customs wants to see what's in the containers, it has historically had to open some of the containers to see if it matches what's on the manifest. But that becomes a crapshoot. Most cargo ships hold around 20,000 containers that have to be unloaded and moved out of the harbor as quickly as possible.With RFIDs, you can simply use a scanner that can read the contents of the containers without ever having to open them up. Much faster and efficient. You may also see them in mail order packages that show up at your house. The pharmaceutical industry has begun to use them with name brand drugs and opioids to track them as they make their way to pharmacies and hospitals. STM is one of the leading makers of RFIDs.As for the quickly developing megatrend the Internet of Things, STM has been waiting for the market to catch up to it for years. And now it has. The stock is up more than 190% in the past 12 months. But this is simply pent-up growth from years of preparation for industry to catch up with STM technology.Put the Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Nightmare to BedThe other significant advantage STM has in this sector is its size. Now that companies are investing in this kind of transformative tech, they need a proven supplier that can deliver large quantities of high quality products.And STM can deliver both.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) Stock Booms on Buyout Rumors;4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAK Steel Holding Corporation(NYSE:AKS) is one of the few big movers in an extremely low-volume Friday on a little bit of takeover chatter that's rattling shorts in AKS stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Irene Grassi via Wikimedia (Modified)While nothing has been confirmed, the rumor of the day is that Japanese metals companyMitsui & Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:MITSY) is interested in buying AK Steel. That has AKS shares up more than 8% in Friday's trade.Also helping out is a suddenly worried bear crowd; short sellers have worked their way into a position of roughly 22% of AKS' float.AK Steel has ebbed and flowed since its 2008 collapse, but has never been the same, suspending its dividend 2012 amid profitability issues. That problem hasn't gone away either, with the company digging into its red ink last year but unable to produce positive earnings.AKS stock - like most other steel plays - popped during the last two months of 2016 amid Donald Trump's presidential victory, which brought with it the hope of a massive infrastructure spend that would buoy the financials of AKS and competitors includingUnited States Steel Corporation(NYSE:X).The 7 Biggest Land Mines in Your Portfolio Right NowHowever, as some of Trump's other initiatives, such as passing healthcare reform, have either failed or been delayed, AK Steel has given up much of those gains, with the market unsure if or when a great infrastructure plan will finally be unfurled. In fact, AKS shares are off 25% this year versus a 5% gain for the market, even with today's gains.From a technical standpoint, Friday's move has AKS stock bouncing strongly off its 200-day moving average, which shares have been testing as support since late March. Overhead, AK Steel is now colliding with its shorter-term 20-day moving average, which has acted as pretty resilient resistance since January, when shares pierced below it.That included a first test in late January that failed hard after AK Steel reported a fairly upbeat fourth quarter, but said on a conference call that it believed Q1's average selling prices would be ""relatively flat.""AKS' next earnings report is expected Tuesday, April 25, before the bell.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCruise to Free Income from Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockNvidia Stock Is Ready to Bounce (NVDA)Who Loses If Apple Inc.

Nvidia Stock Is Ready to Bounce (NVDA);4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen I last checked in onNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), shares were bumping up against technical resistance in the $110 region. I was concerned that NVDA stock was in for a bit of short-term weakness due to broad market factors and underappreciation from the brokerage community.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs it turns out, I was right on the money.Following a minordowngrade from Pacific Crest""underweight"" from ""sector weight,"" Nvidia stock retreated sharply and is now perched on support in the $100 region. The drop shouldn't be unexpected for Nvidia shareholders, as many speculative investors are looking to take profits following NVDA's blockbuster rally in 2016.Yes, there are still more than a few hangers-on from that rally, and gyrations in the broad market and blips from the brokerage community are sure to spark rounds of panic selling.But Nvidia's long-term outlook remains solidly bullish, and if you are a buy-and-hold trader, myrecommendations from March 22still stand.10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideIf you are more of a speculative trader, however, then the recent pullback in Nvidia stock represents a short-term bullish trading opportunity.Charts and SentimentTechnically speaking, NVDA shares have bounced between support at $100 and resistance in the $110 and $120 region since the start of 2017. The shares are currently trading near the bottom edge of this range, and appear ready to head higher once again.Click to EnlargeWhat's more, NVDA stock is on the verge of short-term oversold territory, increasing the likelihood that technical buyers could move in and support the shares.Sentiment, meanwhile, has shifted a bit since late March. Thomson/First Call now reports that 19 of the 35 analysts following NVDA stock rate it a ""buy"" or better, down slightly over the past couple of weeks. The consensus 12-month price target now rests at $113.72 and represents a 12.8% premium to yesterday's close. All in all, there is still room for potential upgrades or price target increases that could emerge from Nvidia's growing presence in the automotive and internet of things operations.Options traders, meanwhile, have grown more cautious, which should be a good thing for NVDA as it means we are far from disconcerting bullish euphoria on the shares. Currently, the April/May put/call open interest ratio arrives at 0.97, up from the equivalent March put/call OI ratio of 0.8 taken a few weeks ago.Zeroing in on May implieds, we find that options traders are pricing in a potential move of about 11% for NVDA stock. This places the upper bound at about $111 and the lower bound at $89. While there may be a brief dip below $100, Nvidia should come roaring back in short order. Meanwhile, a break above $110 could provide a much larger upside move than options traders are expecting.2 Trades for NVDA StockCall Spread:With Nvidia near oversold levels and the shares perched on key technical support, a rebound could be in the cards for the short-term. Traders looking to bet on a rally might consider aMay $100/$110 bull call spread.Cruise to Free Income from Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockAt last check, this spread was offered at $3.66, or $366 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $103.66, while a maximum profit of $6.35, or $634 per pair of contracts, is possible if NVDA stock closes at or above $110 when May options expire.Put Sell:If your risk tolerance isn't quite that high, then a more neutral-to-bullish May $95 put sell may be more to your liking. At last check, theMay $95 putwas bid at 59 cents, or $59 per contract.If Nvidia closes above $95 when May options expire, then you get to keep the premium received. But, if NVDA stock trades below $95 ahead of expiration, then traders may be assigned 100 shares at a price of $95 per share, for every contract sold.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceUnder Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Needs a Change, And SoonTake Profits on Amazon.com, Inc.

Count on Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock’s Consistency;4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsProcter & Gamble Co(NYSE:PG) has been around for almost 180 years at this point.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Let that sink in. Almost 180 years. Over that course of time, it has been through quite a lot. Texas had recently declared independence from Mexico, Martin van Buren was President of the United States - and PG was selling soaps and other millinery.While its dividend doesn't go backthatfar, it has grown its dividend every year since Dwight D Eisenhower was president. Its rival along the way has beenColgate-Palmolive Company(NYSE:CL), which has been around even longer. More recently the Anglo-Dutch conglomerateUnilever Plc (ADR)(NYSE:UL) has also joined the fray. However, PG towers above its competitors in market cap.The interesting thing is, Procter & Gamble has cut almost 100 brands since 2014 in effort to focus its energies on its top products. The strategy has paid off. Margins are strong, debt is down and the stock continues to perform well.All that, and it delivers a rock-solid 3% dividend yield.The 7 Best Retirement Stocks That No One Talks AboutGranted, since the Donald Trump Rally has begun, its dividend and slow-but-sure growth may not look very sexy but not everything in your portfolio should be rockets to the moon. And given the continued run up, you can be sure that the good times aren't going to last forever. We're already seeing signs of growing volatility, which is a sign that president and Congress' honeymoon is over on Wall Street and it's looking for results now, not rhetoric.The Future of PG StockOnce significant economic decisions are made in Washington, you can be sure Wall Street will vote with its feet. And that is why stocks like Procter & Gamble are so important to have as bedrocks to any portfolio. It has proven it can grow through the toughest market conditions. And if things get dicey, even the seasoned professionals turn to consumer staples like PG.There are some challenges in some of its key strategic markets. For example, UL's Dollar Shave Club is making inroads into Procter & Gamble's stranglehold on the men's shaving sector, where PG now has a 65% market share. But in the big picture of things, this isn't a major concern because it is very good at keeping its costs under control.For example, in 2012 its costs of goods sold were around $42 billion. This year, they're around $32 billion, according to company numbers. All that was occurring while the global economy was going through slow to no growth. And it has continued that kind of hard-nosed look at its bottom line to this day.But it's not all about cutting products and costs, either. PG is also focused on the next wave of growth. For example, it recently just finished a deal to purchase a start-up laundry business for college students. The operation is already on 23 college campuses around the U.S. and now PG will roll out itsTide University Laundrybusiness to even more locations.Richard Band'sProfitable Investingadvisory service helps retirement savers outperform the market without losing a minute of sleep along the way.

Put the Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Nightmare to Bed;4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf there's any company on Wall Street's hit list, it'sTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR). This is an organization that absolutely needs a positive break. With each passing day, however, that appears more and more unlikely for TWTR stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhether you're a technical trader or a fundamental investor, the stats on Twitter stock are undeniably horrid. The critical dilemma is that Twitter does not offer a useful platform unless you're a celebrity, journalist or social media guru.UnlikeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which is a platform for everybody, regular folks have no incentive to tweet into the void.Still, Twitter stock has a contrarian argument. Those that use it, use it well. It's widely integrated into popular culture and serves as an effective marketing tool for businesses. Most importantly, with TWTR stock down firmly into the ""teens,"" could a contrarian play work here?Twitter's Ubiquity Is UnderratedFor all the criticisms dished out against Twitter - and I'm guilty as charged - we don't appreciate just how important the company has become. To my knowledge, every news outlet has a Twitter account, allowing them to deliver content directly to their viewership. It's the same for any institution of importance. In fact, it's weird if an entity doesn't have an account.The 10 Best Fidelity Funds for RetireesBecause of its prevalence, it was only a matter of time before Twitter Inc wouldbecomethe news. On Thursday, the social media company filed afederal suitagainst the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The complaint alleges that Twitter Inc received an unlawful summons regarding information that would expose a vocal critic of President Trump.Although the impacted parties are declining to comment, the suit comes at a time of heated debates over immigration. Due to the Trump administration'scrackdownon illegal aliens, the political vitriol has reached unprecedented levels. From some perspectives, Twitter is regarded as a hero for standing up to a ""tyrannical"" administration. That said, the impact to TWTR stock was actually negative, with shares falling 1% on the day.The greater issue is that the lawsuit affirms the importance and relevance of Twitter, and by extension, TWTR stock. If nobody cared about TWTR, the Feds would not have filed a summons. Doing so would simply turn a candle into a forest fire.In reality, we know that Twitter molds and shapes the young minds of the international community. It's more powerful than a nuclear warhead. For better or for worse, that's the reason why the Trump administration stepped in.The Price May Be Right for TWTR stockConsidering this enormous leverage, the central criticism is not about whether TWTR stock is a valid investment. What else, besidesAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) orAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), gives you such dominance over a particular sector? Instead, it comes down to the price point.In the final day of trading in 2013, TWTR stock closed out the year at $63.65. Today, shares trade hands at less than $14.50. Granted, nobody liked Twitter stock at $60, or anywhere within a 500-mile radius … but at current levels, you have to wonder when too much pain is literally too much. Keep in mind that Twitter's all-time closing low is $14.01 and its absolute low is $13.73.Click to EnlargeGranted, this does not mean that TWTR stock is undervalued against fundamental benchmarks. Furthermore, theproblems afflictingTwitter are well-documented. At the same time, they've been well-noted for a lengthy period, yet shares have refused to convincingly break below $14.I believe what we're seeing is a long-term technical support line. This is where shorting Twitter stock is no longer appealing. Assuming that's the case, speculative traders could make a short-term swing play.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Be GuttedI'm in no way suggesting that TWTR should form the backbone of your portfolio. What I am saying is that most stocks have an equilibrium point where even critics could consider the bullish argument.

Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Faces a Growing Bear Threat;4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) is up roughly 40% since the November elections, but it has hardly been a smooth ride. After an initial surge following Donald Trump's victory, BofA shares took a multiweek rest. Following another push forward ahead of the Federal Reserve's expected rate hike, Wall Street sold the news and sent BAC stock into its current double-digit funk.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrNow, hopes for continued Fed rate hikes later on this year are tapering off following a disappointing March jobs report, causing BofA to slip in Friday's trading. Other worries are mounting, too, amid uncertainty in Washington. Trump's failure to get traction on the American Health Care Act has shaken investors that thought financial deregulation was a sure thing; and even if something does get done, the timetable has been pushed back.That, and a newly launched strike against Syria, are further muddying the waters, sending bank shares - including BAC stock - even lower.But investors who look at today's environment and panic about the next few months or even years for Bank of America are missing the bigger picture.Investors Take Their ProfitsInvestors have spent the past couple of weeks baking in the increased uncertainty and longer time span for bank deregulation. The idea was that a cut-down on bank rules would give banks more flexibility, improve operating efficiency and boost the bottom line.The 7 Best Retirement Stocks That No One Talks AboutBank of America's CET 1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the fourth quarter at 11%. Its leverage ratios exceed that of the U.S. regulatory minimums that will take effect next year. Should the government loosen requirements, the bank will have more capital available that it can use to do more business.Of course, Wall Street is forgetting that even if no regulatory requirements change, BAC now manages its business with an understanding of its risks. This includes things like bad mortgages. BofA now calculates its operational risk capital and strives to get that number lower every quarter.Looking beyond the near-term, Bank of America's prospects are pretty strong. Last quarter, the company earned 40 cents per share on a top line of $20 billion. The company on Jan. 13 highlighted its growth in average deposits, up 5% year-over-year to $64 billion. Charge-offs improved by 23%, while productivity improvements in the quarters ahead will maximize the return on any higher rates.Deposit and Loan GrowthCEO Brian Moynihan expects market share growth so long as deposit growth outpaces the market average.Technology shifts, such as digital and mobile, will also add meaningfully to this asset growth. Look for the bank to grow its sales force, which will accelerate its asset size.Deposits are growing at a steady rate, but the bank is maintaining good pricing discipline. Expenses fell in the quarter even as its investment in the business continued. The net result will lead to a higher ROI for investors without more risks.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Launches ""World's Most Powerful"" Graphics CardIn the fourth quarter, Bank of America's loans grew on the consumer side, too:""We saw a $50-odd billion of deposit growth year-over-year. Consumer business was the lion's share of that. To give you a sense, fourth quarter '15 to fourth quarter '16, checking balance in the consumer business grew 12%, so the growth is strong.""BAC also is repurchasing shares and keep its credit risk metrics within tolerable levels.Bottom Line on BAC StockBank of America is a solid financial institution that will give investors strong, risk-adjusted returns. While BofA might not get additional rate hikes as soon as hoped for, the Federal Reserve has at least gotten the ball rolling, and Bank of America will benefit as a result.Investors who missed out on a near-doubling in BAC stock over the past year would do well to let the market keep chipping away at Bank of America over the next couple of weeks before buying in.But the chances are low that any dip will last for long.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFriday's Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Friday’s Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStock futures are on edge this morning, as Wall Street digests news that U.S. warships bombarded Syrian targets with dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles. The news ramped up tensions for traders, who were already contending with President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping and the scheduled monthly U.S. jobs report.makeArticleAd();Against this volatile backdrop,Dow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are off 0.15%,S&P 500futures have fallen 0.14% andNasdaq-100futures are lower by 0.07%.On the options front, volume returned to normal on Thursday, with about 12.6 million calls and 11.3 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rebounded to 0.66, while the 10-day moving average held at a one-month low of 0.61.Driving Thursday's options volume,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) saw heavy activity after Goldman Sachs started AMD stock with a ""sell"" rating. Elsewhere,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) calls trickled in after announcing it was hiring 30,000 part-time positions. Finally,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) saw mixed activity after Barclays offered up what it called a ""reality check"" on TSLA stock.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on AMD stock yesterday with a ""sell"" rating, joining a rather small bearish crowd in the brokerage community.According to Goldman, traders have gotten ahead of themselves by pricing in all the good news and leaving all the risks to the downside. AMD stock tumbled more than 6% following Goldman's initiation, pushing the shares below their 50-day moving average.The 7 Best Retirement Stocks That No One Talks AboutOptions traders, meanwhile, turned to AMD calls in a rush. Total volume arrived at a near-term high of 674,000 contracts, with calls accounting for 63% of the day's take.The bearish note took a toll on AMD sentiment, however, as the April put/call open interest ratio rose to 0.84, indicating that much of yesterday's call activity may have been the result of rollouts or profit taking on short-term positions. A continuation of this trend after the weak hands have been shaken out could be a bad sign for AMD stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Even as many of its brick-and-mortar competitors lay off workers and shutter stores,Amazon is hiring. The company said yesterday that it was bringing on 30,000 new employees, including some 5,000 customer service positions. Amazon part-time workers putting in at least 20 hours a week get benefits, as well as bills that cover tuitions for high-skill fields.While hiring in the face of waning competition is typically a bullish sign, AMZN stock declined more than 1% yesterday. Additionally, AMZN options traders were just as stoic as ever, with calls only making up 55% of the more than 387,000 contracts changing hands on the issue. Furthermore, short-term traders remain quite wary on AMZN, with the April put/call OI ratio arriving at 1.22.Now, this preference for puts may be more of a premium issue, as buying AMZN near-the-money calls can be an expensive affair, while selling deep out-of-the-money puts is not only relatively safe, but also profitable given the lofty premiums for AMZN options.Tesla Inc (TSLA)With TSLA stock skirting all-time high territory and $300 per share, Barclays felt that traders needed a wakeup call. Using a reference to the post-apocalyptic movie ""The Matrix,""Barclays analyst Brian Johnsonsaid that he will be taking the ""red pill"" when it comes to TSLA, as the stock's valuation is too high given Tesla's fundamentals. Johnson reiterated his ""underweight"" rating and $165 price target.Take Profits on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock NowTSLA options traders were only mildly interested in the bearish note, as calls still made up more than 56% of the 339,000 contracts traded on Tesla yesterday - a relatively typical day for the shares.Over the short-term, TSLA options traders remain defensive when it comes to taking positions on the shares, as the April put/call OI ratio comes in at 1.09, with puts just edging out calls among options set to expire this month.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for Years10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideGeneral Electric Company (GE) Stock Is a Buy at LastThe postFriday's Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Take Profits on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Now;4/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) fell a little more than 1% on Thursday as shares became overheated in the near-term. While I still love Amazon, as well as the longer-term prospects for AMZN stock, the question right now is what's next in the short-term?makeArticleAd();Specifically: Is this two-day bearish reversal merely a pause before Amazon's next push higher toward $1,000, or is a better mean-reversion move to the downside in the cards?So you know, Amazon.com is scheduled to report its next batch of earnings in a little less than three weeks from today, on April 27. As I always say, from a swing trading perspective, reducing or entirely closing stock positions into their earnings reports helps you avoid making a bet on what's ultimately a binary income. If and when the stock in question sets up for a new trade after earnings, all the better.When I last discussed AMZN stock onMarch 23, I said that shares appeared to be coiling up for a breakout move to the upside in the near future. Four days later, the breakout occurred. The first upside price target of $880 was reached two days after that.The 7 Best Retirement Stocks That No One Talks AboutAmazon shares continued the rally all the way toward $923 this Wednesday before getting exhausting.AMZN Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that as a result of the most recent breakout rally, Amazon has once again reached the upper end of the multiyear rising wedge formation.Click to EnlargeLike I always way, on its own, this is no reason to become bearish on a stock. However, it is good risk management to take profits along the way at such junctures.Yesterday, I said theNasdaq-100- as represented by thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1(ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) - is beginning to look stretched on the upside. It too is reaching the upper end of its trending channel.Considering that AMZN stock is a good-sized part of the QQQ, this coinciding of both vehicles at the upper end of their trends should be respected.3 Stocks to Watch on Friday: Twilio Inc (TWLO), Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (JNUG) and Ruby Tuesday, Inc. (RT)On the daily chart, we see Amazon's breakout over the past week-and-a-half more clearly.Click to EnlargeNote that as a result, the stock is once again overextended above its 21-day simple moving average (yellow) and the MACD momentum oscillator is signalling overbought.On Wednesday, Amazon stock closed well off its intraday highs as the broader market reversed lower. This was followed on Thursday by what I refer to as a follow-through selling day. My proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator flashed a near-term sell signal in AMZN on Thursday, too.Active traders could look to play the stock to the downside for a mean-reversion move toward a first downside target near $870-$880. More patient traders may consider taking full or partial profits in AMZN stock and buy again at the next bullish reversal.Like what you see?

Are Light Vehicle Sales on a Secular Decline?;4/6/2017;"The automotive industry came out with its monthly sales data this week and things don't look so good. While March does seem to be something of a low point, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) was the lowest in two years. Data provider Autodata says that SAAR of sales for March 2017 was 16.62 million units compared with 16.67 million units a year ago.WardsAuto data was even more conservative at around 16.53 million units. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting around 17.3 million units, so auto stocks did a nose dive following the results.What Seems to Be the Problem?Used Car Prices Are on a Decline: With used car supplies on a rise as a large number of previously-leased cars reportedly hit the market, there is a pressure on prices. This impacts new car sales because of cheaper used car alternatives. It also extends the replacement cycle since turning in an old car fetches a lower price. This affects new car sales.Longer Holding Period: People have been hanging on to their cars longer than they did earlier, mainly because of the extended recessionary conditions that made consumers more conservative. So even after the markets got more conducive, the decision to replace has become dependent on incentives (at least in part). Morgan Stanley expects government incentives like cash for clunkers to kick in some time this year, as older cars without the latest safety equipment continue to get into more accidents.Lower Gas Prices, Rising Consumer Confidence: This would be positive for car sales; just that consumers seem to be bypassing the light vehicle category and opting for SUVs and pickups instead. This is an overall positive for automakers although negative for their light models because SUVs and trucks are higher-priced and generate higher profits. IHS Markit analyst Stephanie Brinley says that new SUV models to hit the market this year will ensure strong sales and ""These vehicles will continue to drive the story of increasing popularity of utility vehicles and maintain pressure on car sales.""Rising Delinquencies on Auto Loans: The last few years have been favorable from an interest rate perspective, helping sell cars, especially to those who would not otherwise have bought one. But the situation is getting a bit out of control as the 60+ day delinquency rate for subprime auto loans is at the highest in at least seven years, according to Fitch. But since car sales remain hard to make, it could further increase competition between lenders, adding to their risk (as Moody's predicts). This would mean a contraction in loan supply further down the line, driving a vicious cycle.Automakers have now started increasing their discounts on cars in order to burn off rising inventories and there should be corresponding negative impact on profits. But sales levels indicate that even the heavy discounting is not fetching desired results, so they may be required to cut production. This will of course lead to lower capacity utilization and thereby, hit margins again.2017 Was Supposed to Be GoodMorgan Stanley was positive about car sales going into the year and estimated that sales would grow 2-4%. It was banking on higher replacement and government incentives.Germany's Center for Automotive Research (CAR) estimated a 2% increase, on the back of Trump's economic stimulus programs and tax cuts.J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said that expected fiscal stimulus and deregulatory policies of President Donald Trump would boost sales.BMI Research was less enthusiastic, saying that the market was reaching a natural plateau after several years or strong growth and that rising used car stocks and the debt situation would take a toll. It expects a 1-1.8% decline this year despite 1% growth in SUVs and trucks.March Gainers and LosersThetop gainersin March shipments were General MotorsGM1.5%, Tesla MotorsTSLA45.9%, Nissan 3.2%, Volkswagen 2.6%, Mitsubishi 6.2%, Mazda 4.9%, BMW 3.6%, Daimler 2.0%, Subaru 11.3%, Porsche 3.6%.Thetop losersin March were FordF-7.2%, Fiat Chrysler AutomobilesFCAU-4.6%, Toyota Motor Sales (TM) -2.1%, HondaHMC-0.7%, Hyundai -8.0%, Volvo Cars -21.9%, Kia Motors -15.2%.Summing UpThis year could see automakers under pressure to sell accumulated inventory of light vehicles and they may also be driven to cut production. But there will be a boost in other areas, so companies like Ford that have popular models in those categories will do well.Second, there is expected to be a steady flow of new SUV models that will also be positive for automakers' revenue and profitability. Not all automakers have gotten in the electric car game, but 2017 should also see some speeding up there, particularly because it is incentivized by the government.So although light vehicle sales remain disappointing and the near to mid-term prospects in that category aren't too bright, this may not be a disappointing year for automakers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Tesla Inc: The Model S Is Better Than the Model 3;4/6/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is getting aggressive about informing potential   customers that its upcoming Model 3 is not a third version of its   Tesla vehicles, but rather a smaller, more affordable version of   its pricier Model S sedan, with fewer features and less   range.Tesla CEO Elon Musk first started pushing this anti-selling of   Model 3 late last month, when he tweeted, ""Am noticing that many   people think Model 3 is the 'next version' of a Tesla, like   iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."" In a follow-up tweet, Musk   admitted the Model 3 name could cause confusion: ""I was a dumb   idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause   confusion.""Model S. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();But now Tesla is back again with a more formalized approach to   clarifying any confusion about how the Model S and Model 3   differ. In a new company blog post, titled ""Model S or Model 3,""   Tesla details the different value propositions for the two   vehicles. Here are some highlights from the blog post.Model S is more advanced than Model 3""Our higher priced premium models still include the most   advanced technology and the best driving experience we have to   offer,"" reads the blog post. Tesla goes on to explain that Model   S is still a hit with customers. Citing a recentConsumer Reportssurvey, Tesla said 94% of Model S owners would buy the vehicle   again.Key differentiating features for the Model S compared to the   Model 3 include:It has a 5-star safety rating and will continue to be our     flagship Model with more range, more acceleration, more     power, more passenger and cargo room, more displays (two) and     more customization choices. With Ludicrous+, Model S has a     zero-to-60 time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend,     making it the fastest accelerating production car in the world.     Model S will also continue to be the longest-range vehicle     we offer, capable of a landmark 335 miles on a single charge,     meaning you can travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco     nonstop.So, what does this leave for the Model 3? Ultimately, the   biggest value proposition for the Model 3 is its more affordable   price tag. Model 3 will start at $35,000 while Model S starts at   $74,500 (Tesla isdiscontinuing its $68,000 60 kWh Model Son April 16). Apart from Model 3's lower price tag, Model S has   Model 3 beat: The Model 3 is smaller, simpler, and will have   fewer options than Model S, Tesla explained in Thursday's blog   post. In addition, the Model 3's starting driving range of 215   miles is well below the 259-mile starting driving range of the   Model S.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.Safety is still a top priority for Model 3When it comes to safety, however, Tesla won't be compromising.   The self-driving hardware will come standard in Model 3, just as   it does in Model S, Tesla explained on Thursday. Tesla says   over-the-air updates will eventually enable all Tesla vehicles,   including Model 3, with thisOctober-released hardwareto achieve a safety level that is ""substantially"" greater than   what a human driver is capable of.Tesla's anti-selling of Model 3 in favor of Model S comes as   Model S sales growth is slowing. In 2016, Model S deliveries   increased only 1% compared to 2015. And in Tesla's first quarter   of 2017, Model S deliveries were only 8% year over year, while   deliveries of Tesla's newer Model X SUV nearly quadrupled.Tesla's need to clarify the differences between Model S and   Model 3 also comes as the company's planned Model 3 launch nears.   Tesla intends to begin Model 3 production in July.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Tesla, Inc. Stock Jumped 11.3% in March;4/6/2017;"What happenedIn March, shares of electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) continued their recent upward momentum. The stock   gained 11.3% during the month, according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatWhile there are likely a number of reasons forTesla stock's rise in March, several events during the month stand out.On March 15, Tesla announced that it would raise over a   billion dollars of capital through concurrent stock and   convertible note offerings. With the capital raise structured to   raise about $250 million in common stock and $750 million in   convertible notes, the company's decision to keep equity dilution   minimal reflected management's confidence in the company's   ability to grow.makeArticleAd();The capital raise came ahead of Tesla's plan to bring its   higher-volume, lower-cost Model 3 to market during the second   half of the year. Tesla explained the capital raise in a filing   with the SEC: ""Tesla intends to use the net proceeds from   the offerings to strengthen its balance sheet and further reduce   any risks associated with the rapid scaling of its business due   to the launch of Model 3, as well as for general corporate   purposes.""Model 3. Image source: Tesla.Another key event during the month was Chinese internet   companyTencent Holdings' strategic investment in Tesla. In a March 24 13G SEC filing, it   was revealed that Tencent had built up a5% stakein the company. Shortly after the position was revealed, Tesla   CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that he was ""glad"" to have Tencent   both ""as an investor and advisor to Tesla.""Now whatTesla stock has continued to rise since March, with shares   hitting new a new all-time high and rising above $300. Given the   significant growth priced into Tesla stock, investors should look   for the electric-car company to launch its highly anticipated   Model 3 on schedule and deliver strong growth across its   business.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

It’s Time Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Bulls Act Humble;4/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe story atTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most interesting in the entire stock market. Led by CEO Elon Musk, Tesla is building an automaker essentially from scratch. (Notentirelyfrom scratch: the company did buy its Fremont, California plant from a joint venture owned byGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andToyota Motor Corp(NYSE:TM).) It will take years, if not decades, for Tesla to achieve its ultimate goals. That timeline leads to a great deal of volatility and controversy in Tesla stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIndeed, there are few stocks more divisive in the entire market. Tesla bulls call Musk a visionary and look to a future revolutionized by Tesla's electric vehicles and solar cells.The bears likely choose different words to describe Musk, pointing to a nearly $50 billion market capitalization off negative free cash flow. After all, Tesla shipped just 25,000 cars in the first quarter, and yet shares of TSLA surpassed that ofFord Motor Company(NYSE:F)!There's truth to both arguments - something TSLA bulls and bears alike too often forget. Tesla has impressive potential - and a price to match. Considering that the story surrounding Tesla stock is going to take years to play out, investors on both sides need to be nimble, and need to be willing to change their views to match the facts on the ground.Most of all, they need to be humble - because at some point, many currently ardent Tesla investors will be proven wrong. Very wrong. The only question at this point is who.Tesla Stock Is Tough to Value@ForIn2020@waltmossberg@mims@defcon_5Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 3, 2017""A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."" Musk is precisely right.The argument about the valuation of TSLA stock is, in essence, an argument about what those future cash flows will be. And that's a legitimate argument to have. We don't know what Tesla's future auto shipments will look like. Government policies worldwide will influence the adoption of Tesla's solar roofs. Considering a February rollout, it's not yet clear what consumers think of the product, or how durable those roof tiles will be under real-world conditions.Where are steel prices going? What will U.S. wages look like in 2018? How about 2025? Each of these data points shapes an individual investor's model of what the current price of Tesla stock should be. Even that model impactsitself. The faster Tesla turns profitable, the less Tesla needs to issue equity to fund the business, and the more of the company current shareholders will own.There are myriad questions to be answered when estimating - emphasis on ""estimating"" - how much cash Tesla will generate in the future, and thus how much a share of Tesla is worth. Intelligent, rational investors can come up with very different end results.It's worth remembering that none - not a single one - of those investors will be right. Some will be closer than others, but we're all just guessing. There are plenty of reasons why investors on both sides could be terribly, terribly wrong.What TSLA Bulls Should RememberFirst, $50 billion is a lot of money. It's too simplistic to argue that Tesla stock shouldn't be worth more than Ford stock simply because Ford makes many more automobiles, and unlike Tesla, is profitable. It's far from guaranteed that TSLA will be more valuable than Ford a year from now - or ten years from now. Tesla has an amazing amount of potential - but it has as much risk as almost any stock in the market.Second, Tesla doesn't operate in a vacuum. Competition in electric vehicleswill be intense. GM has its Bolt.Nissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) will replace the Leaf. On the higher end,Tata Motors'(NYSE:TTM) Jaguar,Audi(OTCMKTS:AUDVF), Porsche(OTCMKTS:POAHY) andMercedesall are targeting the space over the next two to three years.Right now, Tesla can hold its own, and it likely will be a fearsome competitor for some time. But the company also has benefited from largely having the middle- to upper-end of the EV market to itself. That will change.Third, stuff happens.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) was a dot-com bust fifteen years ago.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) almost went bankrupt. GMdidgo bankrupt, and Ford almost followed. One single, even minor, recession changes the growth trajectory for Tesla stock. Consumers tend to focus less on the environment when they're worried about their own pocketbooks.And, by the way, Tesla's CEO is also launching rockets into outer space and trying tocreate cyborgs. He might get tired at some point. In all seriousness, growth stories generally don't go in a straight line. TSLA stock likely won't be any different.What Tesla Stock Bears Should RememberAdmit it - even if you hate Tesla stock, the cars are pretty cool. Reviews are generally positive, and there is some value in the Tesla brand. The valuation may be too high, but it's hard to see Tesla meeting the fate of the Delorean.Secondly, comparing Tesla stock to Ford stock ignores the fact that Tesla isn't just a car company. Tesla even changed its name from ""Tesla Motors"" to reflect that fact. The acquisition of SolarCity and the larger ecosystem ambitions of the company matter to valuation, too. Tesla wants to be a transformative company, not just an automaker.Most importantly, valuation alone is a dangerous reason to short a stock. TSLA bears may be proven right in the long run, but the rest of the market has to realize it for Tesla stock to decline. What comes in the meantime - a borrow fee, potential ""short squeezes"" - could be painful.What All Investors Should RememberInvesting is hard work, but it should be fun at least sometimes. It's just money, after all. Enjoy the ride! Don't take Tesla - or any other stock - so seriously.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Can Hit $1,000. But When?In the case of TSLA, in particular, don't be afraid to change your mind. Because with 100% of the value of Tesla Inc coming from future activity, not current earnings, all of us right now are simply guessing the best we can.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for April11 A-Plus Stocks That Are on Bernstein's 'Buy List'Don't Spend a Penny on Amazon.com, Inc.

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), FireEye Inc (FEYE) and Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM);4/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe breadth of the market's moves continues to erode as small cap and technology stocks are giving way to lower prices. The move means that there are a growing number of technology companies that are likely to see profit-taking over the next few weeks.makeArticleAd();Today's three big stock charts scan the charts forFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE),Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), all of which are showing signs that the sellers may take control of these stocks over the short-term to drive prices lower.FireEye Inc (FEYE)FireEye rallied more than 20% after a pair of upgrades in the end of March attracted buyers. This buying momentum took the shares to an overbought signal that triggered as the quarter ended, conveniently giving traders a reason to ""window dress"" by selling into the short-term strength.Now, after posting yet another in a series of lower highs that started in July of 2016, FEYE stock is headed for a critical test of its 50-day moving average.7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for YearsThe Warm-up for that trendline test will be an almost equally important test of round-numbered support at $12 for FireEye shares. This price served as staunch resistance for FEYE shares in February and March, which means we should see some buying at $12.Failure to hold $12 over the next week will see FireEye move lower to test $11.65, which is the current 50-day moving average value. This considerably strong support trendline is in a declining pattern, meaning that we don't expect technicians and program traders to defend it strongly.Put simply, FireEye bulls may want to get comfortable with the likelihood that the shares still have considerable downside potential. Our models are targeting $10.75.Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)Pressure from overhead and support just beneath has Qualcomm traders scratching their head, but the technicals are telecasting a direction.QCOM has been trading in a tight range lately as the stock is finding support from its 50-day moving average. In a positive development, the 50-day is transitioning into a neutral outlook as it emerges from a declining pattern. That said, there are some concerns with Qualcomm.Namely, QCOM's long-term status, which is currently bearish. The stock is seeing overhead resistance from its 20-month moving average. Currently, this trendline sits above Qualcomm shares at $56.87 - a price that everyone should be watching as we head into the more volatile earnings season.In addition, the weekly charts for QCOM show a comparable situation with resistance at $60.75, so either way you cut the charts up, the bears appear to have the advantage.With Qualcomm stock sitting in no-mans-land in terms of being overbought or oversold, the next move will likely be triggered by a technical break with the most likely of these being the 50-day support. Traders should set their alerts to $56.15 as the make-or-break hold price.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla shares have surged after the company released its latest production data and fell into place as the second largest automobile company in the U.S. by market cap. The combined news moved TSLA stock from $250 to $300, a 20% poke.Tesla stock still appears attractive from a long-term perspective, but traders should expect to see some profit-taking as this is how you generate ""alpha"" in portfolios.Why BP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Is a Deceptive BargainSellers started entering the picture on April 2 after TSLA stock crested above the $300-mark. The selling initiated from the round-numbered resistance and a technically overbought signal. The last time that Tesla saw a similar signal was in February before the shares slid from $280 to $250, a perfect 10% correction.The pullback in the TSLA share price has also brought the end to a bullish volatility rally as shares are now settling back into their Bollinger Band range. This should increase some of the selling pressure on Tesla stock.Support for TSLA lies at $270 and $265, which would account for another 10% correction and a great re-entry price for those active traders to get back into the shares before the next earnings call, which is just a little less than a month from now.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement3 Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy to Beat the MarketThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), FireEye Inc (FEYE) and Qualcomm, Inc.

How to Trade Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock After Earnings;4/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy last write up onBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) yielded fast profits thanks to the recent market-wide dip. If I hadn't scalped the profits on the dip, I would leave the trade open into earnings report two weeks from now.makeArticleAd();Usually, I like to sell risk against proven supports … but the earnings event adds an ominous element of gambling, thereby negating my homework. The short-term reaction to earnings is mostly guesswork. For that reason, any sizable trades in Bank of America options would need to be longer-dated with a large buffer from the current price.After the elections, traders on Wall Street quickly priced in a massive rally in banks. The thesis in play expects a huge upside in bank earnings from higher rates and a loosening of the the regulatory climate. Fundamentally, Bank of America still is a solid bank that should, in the long term, be a buy.Click to EnlargeTechnically, BAC stock consolidated well between December of 2016 and mid-February, before it spiked 10% to more than $25 per share.5 Mega-Cap Stocks Reigniting the Post-Election RallyOn March 21, BAC took a beating along with the rest of the equity market, but it wasn't all bad news. BofA held at that consolidation zone and now it's hovering at the neckline from where it rallied this year.Considering the bulls' defense of the base zone (pictured rectangle on chart), I am willing to risk an upside surprise move in BAC on earnings.I am confident that in the worst case scenario, BAC management is likely to not sound as exuberant … but they are not likely to negate the aforementioned thesis. They could pour a little tepid water on it, but won't change the facts that higher rates and less regulation will result in healthier P&Ls.How to Trade BAC StockThe Bet:Buy the BAC May $24/$25 debit call spread for 30 cents per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. I opted for a near-the-money calls so that if investors buy the earnings event then I am likely to profit immediately. It would be a shame to guess the correct direction, but miss out on size of move. If I haven't done so already, to reduce my out-of-pocket exposure I will sell downside risk against proven long-term support.Could Ford Motor Company (F) Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA)?The Bank:Sell the BAC Dec $20/$19 credit put spread for 25 cents per contract. Here I have a 85% theoretical chance of staying out of the money. A more aggressive trader who intends on owning BAC stock can sell the $20 put naked. If BAC falls below that, they will be put the stock and accrue losses.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3here. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Better Buy: NVIDIA vs. Qualcomm;4/5/2017;"NVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) success in PC graphics cards and its rapid   progress in nascent markets such asautonomous carshave translated into huge gains on the stock market in the past   year. In fact, the graphics chipmaker has outperformed the   NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index by a wide margin, but the same   cannot be said about industry peerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) .NVDAdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Qualcomm has been plagued by competition from Taiwanese rivalMediaTekthat's eating into itsmarket share, while a lawsuit fromApplehas brought morenegative publicity. Simply put, the chipmaker is finding it difficult to grow even   as NVIDIA is showing no signs of stopping.NVDA Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.But is Qualcomm's weakness an opportunity in disguise, or is   NVIDIA a better bet despite its terrific rise in the past   year?The case for QualcommQualcomm needs to be given credit for pursuing several   fast-growing markets to elevate its growth, including feature   phones and virtual reality hardware. Though the chipmaker's   smartphone application processor market share has taken a beating   in the last couple of years owing to MediaTek's rise, it is now   taking the game to its rivals.Qualcomm's Asian rival has thrived by offering lower-cost   chips to smartphone manufacturers. In fact, MediaTek's strategy   helped it increase its smartphone processor market share to 23%   in the first half of 2016 from just 14% at the end of 2014.Qualcomm is now taking a leaf out of MediaTek's playbook by   targeting low-to-mid-range smartphones. The good news is that   this strategy seems to be bearing fruit, as it could begaining market sharein China, which is not surprising as Qualcomm iswinning overcertain chip spots from MediaTek.Image source: Qualcomm.What's more, Qualcomm is also gaining traction at key Chinese   smartphone manufacturers, such as Vivo and Oppo, that are   expected to dominate the industry. The American chipmaker signed   a patent licensing agreement with these companies in August last   year, and it has already found a way inside Oppo's latest F3 Plus   smartphone with its Snapdragon 652 processor.Qualcomm's partnerships with Chinese manufacturers will be   important in boosting its smartphone processor market share. This   is because the country's top three OEMs -- Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei   -- could account for a third of global smartphone shipments this   year with 500 million units in sales.Additionally, Qualcomm is also making a move into the   potentially fertile feature phone market with its latest 205   mobile platform. The chipmaker plans to bring LTE and digital   payments services to sub-$50 phones with its latest launch, which   is a smart move as 400 million feature phones were sold last   year, according to Counterpoint Research.However, China could also pose a concern for Qualcomm as the   government is trying to promote a domestic chip-making industry   with a $100 billion investment. In fact, Xiaomi has already taken   this route as it recently announced that its latest Mi 5C   smartphone will be powered by an in-house chip. This is a red   flag since Xiaomi is one of Qualcomm's customers, and the   possibility of others following suit could land a body blow to   the chipmaker's Chinese business.To mitigate the risk from China, Qualcomm is moving early into   virtual reality (VR) hardware by offering adeveloper kitto accelerate the development of head-mounted displays (HMDs),   which could be a $29 billion industry in 2020. Not surprisingly,   the chipmaker wants to take the lead in this space by trying to   become the supplier of choice to HMD manufacturers.The case for NVIDIANVIDIA's terrific growth is not going to stop anytime soon as   it dominates the discrete graphics processing units (GPU) market   with a 70% market share. In fact, gaming contributes more than   60% to the chipmaker's business, which is good news for investors   as the segment will witness annual growth of 6% for the next two   years, according to Jon Peddie Research.Not surprisingly, NVIDIA is trying to maintain its lead in   this market by tapping high-end gaming systems -- which accounted   for 43% of hardware last year -- and launching its latest   flagship GPU before rivalAMDcould make its move. As it turns out, NVIDIA has upped the ante   in the GPU war by bringing out a new high-performance product --   the GTX 1080 Ti -- which is around 20% to 45% faster than its   predecessor.More importantly, NVIDIA's lead in gaming graphics should give   its top line a strong boost as GPU shipments could rise to 67   million units in 2020 from around 30 million units in 2015,   according to Research and Markets.What's more, NVIDIA is putting its GPU expertise to good use   in the automotive market, which presents a lucrative revenue   growth opportunity. In fact, the company is already supplying its   autonomous car platform toTesla's electric car line-up, while it has also started working withPACCARto develop fully autonomous self-driving trucks.In all, NVIDIA believes it has a revenue opportunity of   $6 billion to $10 billion in the automotive space, and it is   going all-out to target the same by partnering with big   manufacturers.The better buyNVIDIA is a high-growth play as its earnings are expected to   grow around 18% over the next year, compared to Qualcomm's muted   growth projection of less than 3%. Not surprisingly, NVIDIA   carries a premium over Qualcomm from a valuation perspective,   with the GPU maker trading at almost 42 times last year's   earnings as compared to the latter's trailing price-to-earnings   ratio of 17.Additionally, Qualcomm's market share is under threat from   Asian rivals. NVIDIA, meanwhile, is dominating its core market   hands-down and is spreading its wings into other fast-growing   areas that could lead to stronger returns.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Could Ford Motor Company (F) Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA)?;4/5/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirstTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) passedFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) and now it's done the same toGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's right, Tesla has a bigger market cap thanall three of America's automakers. If Tesla stock keeps climbing at the same rate as the first three months of the year - it's up 32% year-to-date through April 5 - by the end of 2017 it could have a bigger market cap than all three of them combined.That's unlikely to happen, but it shows you just how much of a story this is.Right now, Ford stock is stuck in neutral while Tesla stock is flying down the stock market highway at 90 miles per hour. Things are so good for Tesla at the moment we've got Elon Musktauntingthe shorts. Normally, I'm not a fan of CEO outbursts, but it's hard not to like a guy who's singlehandedly changed the car business - for the better.Recently, Ireflectedon Ford's plans for self-driving vehicles including its $1 billion investment in Argo AI, a company that specializes in artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles and founded and still run by the people who were in charge of self-driving cars atAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andUber.I came to the conclusion thatSmart Mobility LLC, the business segment responsible for Ford's work commercializing self-driving cars, was the key to the long-term success of Ford stock.I still feel this way, which is why in recent days I've pondered the question: Could Ford really ever buy Tesla? Well, three things stand in the way.Would Ford Want to Buy Tesla?No one's disputing Ford has a proud history producing cars and trucks in this country; Henry Ford almost single-handedly put the Motor City on a global stage. However, the fact that it continues to lose ground to other car companies including GM, suggests its future is anything but secure.In March, Ford's U.S. sales fell by7%compared to a 5% decline atFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE:FCAU) and a 1.6% increase at GM. For Ford it was a good news, bad news scenario this past month selling 10% more F-Series pickup trucks in March at an average transaction price increase of $2,500 over March 2016. Unfortunately, the rest of its business was abysmal.7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for YearsThere is signs Ford's Lincoln business is getting stronger and its fleet sales are still pretty healthy despite a 17% decline in March against strong year-ago numbers.I'm not sure CEO Mark Fields sees the need to throw a Hail Mary pass at this point in the game. However, we're closer to the second half than I think anyone realizes.Could Ford Afford Tesla Stock?Tesla's enterprise value is currently $54.3 billion with most of that market cap and some net debt thrown in for good measure. Any offer for Tesla stock would have to be well north of $300.Ford's free cash flow for the latest 12 months is $12.8 billion, higher than it's been in the past decade and trending higher. Certainly, the higher prices it's getting for the F-Series helps a whole lot.Ford finished 2016 with $13.2 billion in automotive debt and $27.5 billion in automotive cash with 89% held in the U.S. That puts its automotive net U.S. cash at $11.3 billion. Without selling any assets or issuing shares it's got enough net cash to put down a 20% down payment based on a $60 billion price tag.If debt's used to cover the remaining $48 billion, Ford's debt load would grow four-fold, something that's not nearly as attractive given Tesla's lack of profits. If Tesla were making money it wouldn't be nearly as daunting a task.And of course, there are rising interest rates which could make any discussion of this kind of a moot point.Would Elon Musk Ever Sell?It's really doubtful that the Tesla CEO, who is the company's largest shareholder with26.5%of Tesla stock, would ever consider selling the company he first invested in way back in2004. Not to Ford, not to anyone. There's been too much blood, sweat and tears in the 13 years since then for Musk to give up making Tesla theworld's greatest solar-powered transportation fleet.The only way I could see Ford or any other car company getting a deal done for Tesla would be under two scenarios: The first being that Tesla needed a deal to keep going, and second, the potential acquirer was willing to sell 100% of their business that made combustion-powered vehicles.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is on Sale -- Go Long for FreeClearly, the first scenario is more likely than the second. That said, like the Model T, Ford buying Tesla under either of these scenarios would be historical in nature and likely successful for Ford shareholders.But I wouldn't hold my breath.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Entertainment Stocks to Buy as Summer Approaches11 A-Plus Stocks That Are on Bernstein's 'Buy List'Don't Spend a Penny on Amazon.com, Inc.

Will Clean Energy ETFs Benefit from a Carbon Tax?;4/5/2017;"The Washington Post recently reported that the Trump administration is considering the imposition of two controversial taxes, a value added tax and a carbon tax. Shortly after the story surfaced, the White House declared that it was currently considering neither of the two.A White House spokesperson said that the team is hearing inputs from multiple sources on how to fund the tax reform, as it prepares to get the bill passed in the Congress after the failure of the healthcare bill.This indicates that the tax bill is still in the early stages of development, as Trump fights to keep his promise of individual and corporate tax cuts without harming the economy.The carbon tax is likely to be aimed at industry emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels. Though many Democrats supported the idea in the past, it has been opposed by the majority of Republicans, saying that it would be devastating for the economy. What's interesting is that such a tax, if implemented, would negate President Trump's ideologies on climate change, as it will penalize people who burn coal, oil and gas.When you use fossil fuels to generate electricity, or to power your car, the energy or gasoline prices are reflected in the bill. What is not reflected is the price of negative externalities. An individual is not paying for the pollution caused by the car, even though it is impacting others who breathe the same air. A carbon tax is perhaps one of the better ways to promote the use of clean energy, as it will increase the price of electricity and gas, and therefore lead consumers to shift to hybrid cars and solar energy.The impact of such a move on the economy in terms of unemployment and standard of living is still uncertain. However, assuming rational consumer behavior, if prices of regular commodities rise drastically and alternatives are developed and available at cheaper rates in the future, consumers are unlikely to shy away from clean energy (read:Auto ETF, Stocks Tank on Dismal March Sales: Time to Buy?).Let's take a look at some ETFs that we think would be impacted if the tax is implemented:VanEck Vectors Solar Energy ETFKWTThis fund offers exposure to solar energy companies and is appropriate for investors looking to diversify into the clean energy space.It has AUM of $10.8 million and charges a fee of 65 basis points a year. The fund has around 20% exposure to the United States. A number of individual stocks in the fund saw gains on talks of a carbon tax. It has an 8.4% exposure to First SolarFSLR, up 1.86% (on April 4, 2017), a 7.1% allocation to Atlantica Yield PlcABY, up 0.91%, and 4.93% to Canadian Solar Inc.CSIQ, up 0.98%. It returned 4.32% in the year-to-date time frame and lost 24.97% in the past year (as of April 4, 2017).VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETFGEXThis fund offers exposure to various alternative energy industries and is appropriate for investors who are bullish on the thriving clean energy space.It has AUM of $68.4 million and charges a fee of 62 basis points a year. The fund has around 54% exposure to the United States. It has an 11.95% exposure to Tesla Inc.TSLA, up 1.74% (on April 4, 2017) which might be attributed to great sales data for its Model 3, a 9.59% allocation to Eaton Corp PlcETN, up 0.97%, and 4.87% to EnersysENS, up 0.87%. It returned 9.65% in the year-to-date time frame and 6.75% in the past one year (as of April 4, 2017) (read:Tencent Buys 5% Stake in Tesla: ETFs in Focus).iShares Global Clean Energy ETFICLNThis fund offers exposure to various alternative energy industries and seeks to invest in the global clean energy index.It has AUM of $80.32 million and charges a fee of 47 basis points a year. The fund has around 26% exposure to the United States. It has over 5.7% exposure to Covanta Holding Corp.CVA, up 0.32% (on April 4, 2017), and over 4.8% allocation to First Solar. It returned 9.01% in the year-to-date time frame and lost 5.08% in the past one year (as of April 4, 2017).To ConcludeAll in all, there is growing uncertainty regarding the future of clean energy in the U.S. Though President Trump's stance on climate change does not present a bullish case for clean energy, the failure of his first major legislation might lead him to push harder for the clearance of the tax reform bill in the Congress. Further, demand for alternative energy and hybrid cars is on the rise with major players like Tesla increasingly focusing on electric cars and solar panels to change the market demographics.Though the recent rumors have led to a surge in prices of alternative energy stocks, it is still not clear if such a tax will be implemented. Therefore, we believe it is best to remain on the sidelines for now (read:Buy Hot Tech ETFs to Avoid Trump Uncertainties).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?makeArticleAd();Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3 Reasons to Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Right Now;4/5/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen it comes to stocks,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is as blue chip as they come. The technology giant has been a portfolio staple for decades and has powered generations of investors with long-term gains.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn fact, had you bought MSFT stock when it went public back in 1986, you would have made nearly 67,000% on your investment. No wonder why Bill Gates is the richest person on the planet.And MSFT stock continues to impress investors. Mr. Softy was up an impressive 16% last year alone. With such an extraordinary returns history, the question is, can shares of Microsoft continue to make some serious money for its investors going forward?With the following three catalysts in play, the answer is a resounding yes. Microsoft is still one of the better long-term buys in tech.Everything to Love About MSFT StockThe Cloud: While Microsoft is still the dominating force in PC operating systems, it's future is a bit more cloudy. The continued rise of cloud computing and running virtual machines is driving MSFT stock into the future.According to technology market research firm IDC, worldwide spending on cloud computing services is expected to grow to $195 billion by 2020. That's great news for Microsoft, which is the second-largest player in cloud computing - behindAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). But Azure, Microsoft's main platform, is quickly growing at a faster clip.11 A-Plus Stocks That Are on Bernstein's 'Buy List'Microsoft continues to snag larger enterprise customers. Amazon has done well with smaller firms and regarding infrastructure as a service (IaaS). But the win for MSFT is that Azure can span on-premises and cloud environments.According to tech analysts, many large enterprise IT users still have plenty of hardware of their own and aren't ready to fully embrace the cloud. The full migration of these larger customers is still in the early innings, and because of its capabilities, Microsoft has been quite successful at snagging them.Revenues for Azure surged awhopping 93%last quarter versus the year-ago period, while overall cloud applications and software increased by 8%. Even better is the future. According to asurvey of CIOs by Morgan Stanley, Azure will overtake Amazon Web Services by 2019 in both IaaS and Platform as a Service (PaaS) applications. This continued growth will only continue to drive revenues and profits for MSFT and its cloud division.The Hardware:It's no secret that MSFT hasn't exactly been known for its consumer hardware. Zune anyone? But that has been changing in recent years. Its Surface tablet/laptop hybrid has been a runaway hit. As has its latest Xbox entertainment unit. But the real growth could be from Microsoft's new Surface Studio high-end PC. While computer sales have slipped thanks to smartphone and tablet usage, high-end PCs continue to feature swift sales figures. After all, there's plenty of applications you can't do on the phone.Long has the high-end computer market been ruled byApple Inc's(NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac and smaller firms like Alienware. However, the Surface Studio is a monster of a machine and could significantly take market share from Apple and other high-end producers of PCs.While it won't generate the kind of revenue that its cloud operations will, it does get MSFT's other big business - productivity software - in the hands of more users and could help turn the tide of overall lower licensing fees.The Dividend:Thanks to its sustainable growth in earnings and cash flows, MSFT stock has quickly become dividend stalwart. Over the last ten years, Microsoft has increased its dividend by 300%. It's latest increase was another 8.3%. But more jumps could be on the horizon.For starters, MSFT has about a $121 billion in cash on its balance sheet. That in of itself could lead to more dividends - especially if President Trump plans to allow repatriation of that cash at tax-free rates.There Is No Turnaround for Twitter Inc (TWTR) StockMoreover, gains in cloud computing and other business should help MSFT earn around $4.33 per share in three years. Keeping its average rate of dividend growth, MSFT stock should pay out around $2.10 to $2.15 per share in dividends in three years. That should give it a comfortable payout ratio of around 49%. That's easily doable and will lend itself to more dividend increases as well.In the end, the growth in cloud computing and other surprise businesses - like hardware and LinkedIn - will continue to propel MSFT stock forward. It's hefty, and growing dividend is icing on the cake. For investors looking for one of the best tech stocks out there, Mr. Softy has to be on your list.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Energy Stocks That Are Ready for a Turnaround7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for YearsShort Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Without Getting Run OverThe post3 Reasons to Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Right Nowappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Ride on Surging Tesla With These ETFs;4/5/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Tesla MotorsTSLAhas become an investors' darling and is riding high setting new milestones. This is especially true as the electric carmaker has rallied nearly double digits this week to hit a record high of $304.81.With this surge, Tesla has become the No. 2 car company in the U.S. with a market capitalization of $49.5 billion, easily surpassing Ford Motor Co.Fhaving a market cap of $44.4 billion. The race to the big three carmakers in America auto industry has now become fierce with Tesla just $1.8 billion behind General MotorsGM, which saw shares plunging post disappointing sales in March. General Motors is currently worth $51.3 billion (read:Auto ETF, Stocks Tank on Dismal March Sales: Time to Buy?).Tesla's impressive performance is backed by better-than-expected first-quarter production and delivery numbers. Tesla delivered a record 25,000 vehicles (13,450 Model S and 11,550 Model X), up 69% year over year, during the first quarter. It produced a record 25,418 vehicles and had 4,650 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter.The automaker is on track to deliver 47,000-50,000 vehicles in the first half of 2017. Additionally, the company expects to produce 5,000 cars per week later in the year once production of the new Model 3 begins in July.As Tesla is all about electric cars, its production and delivery plans matter most to investors. Currently, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a VGM Style Score of F but has a poor Zacks Industry Rank (in the bottom 11%). Its earnings and revenues are expected to grow 48.17% and 58.55%, respectively, this year versus the industry averages of 6.30% and 1.55%. Further, its long-term growth rate is also inspiring at 30%, double the industry average growth of 14.20%. All these suggest smooth trading for the carmaker in the coming months (read:Electric Cars Find Favor with City Administrators: ETFs in Focus).ETFs to BuyGiven the recent optimism, investors should definitely ride the upcoming surge in a basket form. Below are four ETFs with the highest allocation to this tech titan that could make for a compelling play at least in the near term.Market Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETFGEXThis ETF tracks the Ardour Global Index Extra Liquid, focusing on global companies that are primarily engaged in the business of alternative energy. The fund holds about 31 stocks in its basket with AUM of $68.2 million while charging 62 bps in fees per year. Average daily volume is paltry at about 6,000 shares. Tesla Motors occupies the top position in the basket with 11.9% allocation. In terms of country exposure, the fund is skewed toward the U.S. with 53.1% share while Denmark and China round off the top three spots (read:Tencent Buys 5% Stake in Tesla: ETFs in Focus).ARK Industrial Innovation ETFARKQThis is an actively managed ETF seeking long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies that benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvement and advancements in scientific research related to robotics, energy storage, innovative materials, alternative energy sources, infrastructure development, space exploration, autonomous vehicles and 3D printing. This approach results in a basket of 37 stocks, with TSLA occupying the top spot with 11.6% share. The product has accumulated $24.7 million in its asset base and charges 75 bps in fees per year. It sees a paltry volume of about 5,000 shares a day.First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index FundQCLNThis fund tracks the Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy Index and manages assets worth $55.9 million. It charges 60 bps in fees per year while trades in light volume of around 12,000 shares per day. In total, the product holds 38 U.S. securities with Tesla Motors taking the top spot in the basket at 9.8%. Industrials and technology firms dominate this ETF, accounting for nearly 28% of the assets each while oil & gas, and utilities round off the next two spots with a double-digit allocation each (read:Trump Repeals Clean Power Plan: ETF Winners & Losers).ARK Innovation ETFARKKLike ARKQ, this is also an actively managed fund and follows the same strategy but provides exposure to genomic companies, industrial innovation companies or Web x.0 companies. In total, the fund holds 47 securities in its basket, with Tesla occupying the top position holding 7.7% share. The product has accumulated $18 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of about 5,000 shares.

Are Options Traders Betting on a Big Move in Tesla (TSLA) Stock?;4/5/2017;"Investors inTesla Motors, Inc.TSLAneed to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the July 4th, 2017 $230 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together anoptions tradingstrategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Tesla shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Tesla is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Automotive - Domestic industry that ranks in the Bottom 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased earnings estimate for the current quarter, while no analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 68 cents per share to a loss of 67 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Tesla right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Bankruptcies Give Vivint Solar and Sunrun a New Opening in Residential Solar;4/5/2017;"The residential solar industry in the U.S. is up for grabs and   there could be a new opportunity forVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) to grab market share.SungevityandVerengo Solarrecently went bankrupt andNRGHome is exiting the home solar business, taking three big   competitors out of the game.This doesn't change the fact that local andregional installers are gaining market share, but it leaves fewer large installers with a national presence.   And there's still an opportunity to use that position to   profitably grow their customer base.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();National installers face the musicAs national installers like Vivint Solar,Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity, and Sunrun built out their business,   they bet that a national infrastructure with third-party   financing (leases) would give them a competitive advantage. Over   the past year,that strategy has fallen apartas loans and local and regional installers have gained market   share. Everyone in the industry is now realizing that the trend   will continue, so Sunrun, Vivint, and Tesla are pushing toward   loans to stem some of the lost market share.While national installers were fighting one another for a   smaller piece of the pie, it left everyone in a weaker position.   But weaker players like Sungevity and Verango Solar didn't   survive, leaving just a few of the larger installers. And they're   making a needed transition to focusing their efforts on   profitable customers, rather than growth at all costs. And with   fewer competitors, it may be easy to make that transition to   profitability.Taking a new strategy to marketFewer competitors and the focus on cash and loan sales could   also open up new markets. When Sunrun announced it was entering   the Wisconsin market last week, it did so with cash and loan   options and notably left out the lease. This is an acknowledgment   both that new markets may see solar as an attractive option and   that the lease is no longer a financing option that's worth   bringing to market.I would expect other states like Minnesota, Missouri (Kansas   City), Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio to attract more installers   with similar structures. Particularly in Tesla's case, the   company could expand into new states just by leveraging its   retail format. But I would expect Vivint and Sunrun to continue   to explore their own expansions now that they're armed with loan   offerings as well.Bankruptcies could be a big opportunityOver the past few years, there have just been too many   companies fighting for the same pie in residential solar. Now   that some of the weaker players are falling off, it'll leave   Vivint Solar and Sunrun in a stronger position, particularly ifSolarCity backs awayfrom solar under Tesla.The fact that local and regional installers are gaining market   share is a challenge, but I think there will still be a place for   national companies that are disciplined in their approach. Look   at it like home construction or home improvement, where there are   national as well as local companies with a place in the   market.At the very least, having less competition will make it easier   for Vivint and Sunrun to operate profitably. And with immediate   cash coming in from more cash and loan sales, these may soon be   cash-generating businesses rather than solar finance companies,   which would be a welcome change for investors.10 stocks we like better than SunrunWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Sunrun wasn't one of     them!

Best Stocks for 2017: Zions Bancorp (ZION) Stock May Find Nirvana in 2017;4/5/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEditor's note: This column is part of ourBest Stocks for 2017contest. John Jagerson and Wade Hansen's pick for the contest isZions Bancorp(NASDAQ:ZION).makeArticleAd();The beginning of 2017 was a time of hope and optimism on Wall Street. The election of President Donald Trump had changed everything from policy expectations and growth expectations to inflation expectations and more, and the ramifications of those changing expectations had just started to play themselves out in the U.S. stock market.With that in mind, we choseZions Bancorp(NASDAQ:ZION) to be one of the top-performing stocks in 2017.We believed ZION was uniquely situated to take advantage of a growing number of the potential changes that were expected to play themselves out in the U.S. economy and stock market this year. We believed the Trump administration could bolster ZION by:Scaling back, or fully repealing, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act;Boosting inflation expectations;Relaxing environmental regulations for drilling while OPEC caps oil production; andLowering corporate tax rates.While the Trump administration has been successful in a few of these areas, it has thus far fallen woefully short in others. Let's take a look.Scaling Back, or Repealing, Dodd-FrankWe were looking forward to the scaling back, or repeal, of the Dodd-Frank Act and believed it would boost ZION's revenue-generating potential by enabling the bank to trade more freely and issue more loans by creating collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) containing trust preferred securities (TrPS). We also anticipated a reduction in expenses for the bank as compliance costs fell.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilUnfortunately, not much has happened on this front. In fact, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has even expressed some support for the Volcker Rule - the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibits financial institutions from engaging in proprietary trading.It's still early, but with all of the other legislative priorities stacking up in front of financial regulatory reform, we aren't as confident this issue is going to be addressed in the near term.Boosting Inflation ExpectationsWe, along with most others, expected President Trump's economic policies to boost inflation here in the United States. Analysts were anticipating increased economic growth, coupled with the potential for trade battles and the implementation of tariffs, would boost inflation. As a result, bond yields would be pushed higher to compensate bond investors for the increased inflation risks they would be facing. This, in turn, would lead to a steeper yield curve, which would be a boon for banks.Unfortunately, the ""reflation"" trade that dominated the market through the end of February has faded, and the yield curve is flattening once again. This is a negative for banks and their net interest margin levels.Relaxing Environmental Regulations while OPEC Caps ProductionPresident Trump made good on his promise to relax environmental regulations for energy producers, including opening up previously unavailable areas for oil exploration, when he signed his ""energy independence"" executive order on March 28. This should benefit oil producers here in the United States, some of whom have taken out loans from ZION.This should help the company reverse the rising tide of having to increase its loan loss provisions to compensate for the number of charge-offs in the energy sector.Lowering Corporate TaxesWith the failure of the Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with the American Health Care Act (AHCA), many are wondering if the Trump administration is going to be able to do what it takes to reform the U.S. tax code and lower corporate taxes.ZION stock has shown in the past that it is more than willing to send cash back to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and share buyback programs. But if tax reform fails to materialize, the company won't have any savings to pass on to shareholders.Conclusion for ZION StockWeekly Chart of Zions Bancorp (ZION)Each of the four fundamental factors we've discussed above has to potential to lift Zions Bancorp to new multiyear highs on its own, but our confidence in them all coming together to push ZION higher has dropped somewhat.The Best Way to Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) at All-Time HighsZION hasn't really moved anywhere since we first looked at this stock at the beginning of the year. It has been up and down, but there has been no net change.It still has the potential to climb back up toward longer-term resistance at $55 during 2017, but it can only happen if the Trump administration and Congress can come together on tax reform.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

It's Official: Tesla Is My Second 10-Bagger;4/4/2017;"I boughtApplethe year before the iPhone debuted (July 2006 at a pre-split   price of $60.83) and I boughtTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) about 18 months before the Model S.It was November 2010, less than five months after Tesla's   initial public offering priced at $17 per share, raising   approximately $225 million to help fund development of the Model   S. While the $29.23 that I paid was a bit higher than that   offering price, it's worked out quite well in the nearly seven   years since, as I still maintain the position to this day. Just   yesterday, Tesla tapped afresh all-time high, surpassing the prior high of around $291 set in September 2014   and exceeding the $292.30 price that technically represents my   threshold for 10-bagger territory. Shares continued running   today.My original Tesla trade confirmation. Image source:     Author.makeArticleAd();Don't get me wrong. Like most investors, my investing career   is littered with as many mistakes as successes, if not more. But   in today's climate of active trading and years of debate around   the ""death"" of buy-and-hold investing, a little celebration is in   order: Long-term investing can still pay off.I got luckyI won't purport to have had some insightful epiphany in 2010   regarding the future of electric cars; I was just a naive   stockbroker at the beginning of my career in finance. As   environmentalists, my wife and I simply thought Tesla was worth   supporting. In other words, we got lucky to some extent, at least   initially. It's notably harder to have the discipline to maintain   such a position, particularly consideringTesla stock's volatility and polarizing nature.Image source: Tesla.What's most important, though, is what comes next. There's an   endless debate about Tesla's valuation, as the company's market   cap has just surpassedFord's and is now approachingGM's. Ford sold 6.7 million vehicles last year, while GM sold 10   million; both are solidly profitable.Tesla delivered 76,000 vehicles in 2016, losing $773 million   in the process. These facts often and justifiably confound   analysts, investors, and industry pundits alike. Hardly a day   goes by without someone arguing that Tesla is overvalued, which   is hard to dispute using traditional valuation metrics. As CEO   Elon Musk pointed out today on social media, valuation is more   about the future than it is the past.@ForIn2020@waltmossberg@mims@defcon_5Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but   that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future   cash flows.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 3, 2017The biggest pitfall of valuationSo much of valuing stocks is fundamentally predicated on   comparable analysis. Tesla makes cars, so the tendency is to   compare it to automakers. However, Tesla's similarities to the   auto industry end there. Tesla is as much an energy company as it   is an auto company. It has been working on battery technology for   years through its partnership withPanasonic, and is stepping directly into the solar industry with 2016's   acquisition of sister company SolarCity. It is more vertically   integrated than traditional automakers, particularly when it   comes to the integration of hardware and software. It uses a   direct model for both sales and support, eschewing the antiquated   dealer model. It goes without saying that Tesla utilizes an   entirely different propulsion technology to power its vehicles.   These are but a few differences, but they easily outnumber the   similarities.This says nothing as to whether or not these differences will   ultimately prove advantageous or not. Only time will answer those   questions. The point is that Tesla is an amalgam of auto, tech,   and energy companies, and there is a dearth of comparable peers.   The closest company that comes to mind is China'sBYD, which stands for ""Build Your Dreams."" Warren Buffett famously   invested in BYD years ago. BYD is the only other notable company   that produces electric cars, battery storage, and solar   panels.But even then, the comparison falls short. Beyond EVs, BYD   also offers products like buses, forklifts, and commercial   trucks, all of which are electric. Even in the passenger car   market, BYD targets the more affordable midrange segment instead   of luxury vehicles. Additionally, BYD operates in an entirely   different geopolitical environment halfway across the world.BYD is also much larger in terms of revenue ($14.5 billion in   2016) but also profitable ($733 million in 2016). For reference,   BYD trades at about 1.2 times sales, significantly lower than   Tesla's 6.9 P/S multiple.To be clear, I'm the first to admit that it's incredibly   difficult to justify new positions in Tesla at current levels,   because so much of the value is baked into the future. The   valuation magnifies the execution risks that Tesla faces in the   years ahead, and there will be many.

Tesla vs. Ford: Which Stock Is a Better Buy?;4/4/2017;"Shares of Tesla, Inc.TSLArose 7.3% on Apr 3 to close at $298.52, while that of Ford Motor CompanyFfell 1.7% to close at $11.44. While price change generally holds significance in itself, a major impact of this change was Tesla's upgradation to the second largest automaker in the U.S. by market capitalization.Yesterday's closing price increased Tesla's market cap to $48.63 billion while that of Ford fell to $45.47 billion. General Motors CompanyGMmaintained its number one spot with a market cap of $51.19 billion.Tesla's share price rose on the preliminary deliveries of first-quarter 2017. The company reported record quarterly deliveries of over 25,000 vehicles, up 69% year over year, indicating its likelihood of achieving the target of 50,000 vehicles in the first half of 2017.Meanwhile, Ford reported U.S. sales of 236,250 units in March, a 7.2% year over year decline. The company's U.S. sales, as of Apr 3, also declined 4.4% year over year.The BackgroundFord was established almost 114 years ago and has been making mass market vehicles for a large part of its history. The company sells millions of cars each year, has revenues in billions and has been profitable every year post the financial crisis.The company generated revenues of $151.8 billion, sold over 2.61 million vehicles and recorded $4.6 billion profit in 2016. It is also focused on enhancing shareholder returns. In first-quarter 2017, the company declared a $200 million supplemental cash dividend, equivalent to 5 cents per share, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend of 15 cents.On the other hand, Tesla is roughly 14 years old and is about to commence the production of its first mass market vehicle, the Model 3. The company is highly unprofitable, deeply indebted and burning cash at a high rate. In 2016, the company generated revenues of $7 billion, sold roughly 76,000 vehicles and remained a loss-making company. Moreover, the company raised further capital of over $1 billion recently.Price PerformanceHowever, Tesla has clearly outperformed Ford over the past one year. During this period, Tesla's shares rallied 20.9% while Ford saw a 10.6% decline.What's Driving Tesla Faster than Ford?While Ford has been a stable company in the long term, Tesla seems to be the favorable choice for investors lately. The electric car maker has been rapidly expanding its operations, with recent proliferation in the Middle East, and plans to make Model 3 available in many new markets, including India, Brazil, South Africa, New Zealand, Singapore and Ireland. The company has also received a vote of confidence in China, with one of the country's largest tech company, Tencent Holdings, revealing its 5% stake in Tesla.The company also aims to ramp up its production to 500,000 units by 2018, although the possibility seems unlikely. Moreover, it is rapidly developing a network of Superchargers with a faster battery-pack charging ability compared to normal electric charging stations to support its vehicles.Meanwhile, Ford discontinued its operations in Japan and Indonesia in 2016 and is facing sluggish demand in South America. The company's future in Europe is also uncertain as its major operations are based in the U.K., which has voted in favor of Brexit. The future of the company depends significantly on trade agreements negotiated with other EU nations.As a result, Ford expects headwinds of $400-$500 million in 2017 and 2018 due to Brexit. It also expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the range of 30-35 cents, lower than the 68 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. The low expectations are attributable to increased costs, lower volumes as well as unfavorable currency translations. In addition, the company's adjusted pre-tax profits and adjusted earnings per share are expected to decline in 2017 from 2016 levels.Let's take a look at how Tesla, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Ford, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.Estimate RevisionsOver the past month, Tesla's current year estimates have narrowed by around 1.5% to a loss of $2.69 per share. On the other hand, Ford's estimates for earnings for the current year decreased 3.7% over the same period to $1.58.EPS & Sales GrowthTesla's EPS and sales have been growing substantially while that of Ford has been declining. In fourth-quarter 2016, as compared to fourth-quarter 2015, Tesla saw EPS and sales growth of 3.1% and 88.1%, respectively, while Ford saw declines of 48.3% and 5%, respectively.Long-Term Growth ExpectationsIn terms of long-term growth expectations, Tesla scores way above Ford. The expected growth rate for Tesla for the next 3-5 years is 30% compared with an expected growth of 8.2% for Ford.LeverageTesla has a lower leverage as evident by its debt to equity ratio of 1.06, compared with Ford's debt to equity ratio of 3.20.In ConclusionGoing by the above arguments, it can safely be said that Tesla stands out as a better investment proposition compared to Ford. With a solid Zacks Rank, positive estimate revisions, better outlook and strong growth prospects, the scale is clearly tilted in favor of Tesla.Another stock investors can consider within the auto sector is Renault SARNLSY.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Promises New Mac Pro in 2018, New Pro iMac in 2017;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been taking heat from customers for ignoring its core, professional Mac users. The Mac Pro was last updated in 2013, and even then, its design alienated some. Apple held a rare turntable event with tech journalists to talk about the Mac. The company promises it has heard the complaints and it's pledging an all new Mac Pro in 2018.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleTo tide those power users over in the meantime, the company has goosed the specs of the existing model, is cutting some prices and it will introduce a new iMac aimed at pro users later this year.Senior Apple Execs Talk Mac PlansApple brought a handful of tech journalists to its headquarters for a very rare, roundtable meeting with three of its senior executives: Phil Schiller (Senior VP Worldwide Marketing), Craig Federighi (Senior VP Software Engineering) and John Ternus (VP Hardware Engineering).The reason? To talk about AAPL's desktop Mac roadmap.The companyupdated its MacBook Pro laptops late last year, but desktop Macs have languished with outdated specs sometimes for years. The Mac Pro was last updated in 2013, the iMac in 2015 and the Mac Mini in 2014. In the meantime, Windows PCs have received multiple upgrades and are equipped with processors and graphics cards that leave AAPL's offering in the dust - despite the Mac premium price tag.The 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q1AndMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has emerged as a threat for the creative professional users who traditionally bought Macs, with its newSurface Studio all-in-one PC.The situation was bad enough that AAPL staged this event to assure everyone that it hasn't abandoned the Mac or its professional users. It follows oncomments from CEO Tim Cookthat suggested APPL might be quietly working on a new Mac Pro.Apple Admits It Missed the Mark with Old Mac ProProfessionals who need a workstation-class desktop PC need a computer that can be upgraded. The Mac Pro AAPL introduced in 2013 looked cool, but its compact cylinder form factor limited upgrade options.Quoted byMashable'sLance Ulanoff (who was at the routable), Apple's Federighihad this to say about the current Mac Pro:""The Mac Pro, the current vintage that we introduced, we wanted to do something bold and different. In retrospect, it didn't well suit some of the people we wanted to reach … We designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner.""Phil Schiller then went on to say that AAPL engineers are designing an all new Mac Pro that supports upgradability and expansion. The Apple team admitted that this move came later than they would like, but promised that a new Mac Pro in 2018 will win back its professional users. It is also going to release a new Pro display, one made by Apple, not theLGmonitor it has been steering customers towardsince discontinuing its Thunderbolt Display last year.In the Meantime, Spec Bumps and a New iMac for Pro UsersA year is a long time to wait for a new computer - especially if you have already been waiting two or three years. But Apple has several solutions in the meantime. After noting that many professional users had been moving to high end iMacs, the company is committing to releasing a new iMac in 2017 that's aimed at pro users.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hits New Highs, Threatens Massive BreakoutIt won't have touch capability - AAPL isn't trying to replicate that Surface Studio - but expect high end component options for this Pro iMac like more powerful CPUs and graphics cards. And for everyone else, Apple is at leastgiving the existing Mac Pro lineup spec bumps and price cuts.Will the new Mac Pro arrive in time to save Apple's professional desktop PC market? While there have been some Windows switchers, Mac users tend to be stubbornly dedicated to the platform. The effort by Apple to be transparent about its plans, acknowledgment that it has allowed its desktop lineup to fall behind and a promise of a new Mac Pro in 2018 will hold many over.For those who can't wait, price cuts and spec bumps take at least some of the sting out of buying a current Mac Pro. And the prospect of a new iMac aimed at the professional market is intriguing.The Mac business may not count for much in an Apple that is focused on iPhone revenue, but the company is sending the message that it has no intention of abandoning the market.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSamsung (SSNLF) Introduces the Galaxy S8 With Infinity DisplayThe New Apple Inc. iPad Strategy Is Sneakier Than You ThinkThe postApple Inc.

Staples, Inc. (SPLS) Stock Soars 13% on Sale Chatter;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStaples, Inc.(NASDAQ:SPLS) wants out. SPLS stock soared more than 13% on Tuesday amid a report that the U.S. office supply retail giant was considering a sale - a year after regulators knocked down a proposed deal with rivalOffice Depot Inc(NASDAQ:ODP). Staples tried to buy its smaller rival for $6.3 billion.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrNow, Staples has switched tactics, apparently looking for a private equity bid, according to aWall Street Journalreport. That same report points out that, with a typical premium, SPLS could court a $7 billion bid. Based on current prices, that would be another 12% higher from here.If Staples were to go private, that would mark an end to a nearly three-decade stretch of publicly traded life; the company executed its IPO on April 27, 1989.SPLS stock quickly spiked to the $10 level - a quick breach of its November-December highs - before falling back down to the $9.75 area, where price resistance is holding. It marks one of the biggest signs of life in shares since May 2016, when the Office Depot deal fell apart.The 7 Biggest Land Mines in Your Portfolio Right NowBroadly speaking, Staples is off more than 60% from its 2007 highs - a steady terminal decline with a few earnings-related bumps here and there, and of course, a period of optimism when it seemed Staples and Office Depot would join forces.Revenues, for instance, have dipped 20% in just the past three years, and net income swung from a $620 million profit in 2013 to a massive $1.5 billion loss. While nearly half of that was affected by goodwill impairment and restructuring costs, it's still an ominous figure.Disturbingly, the company hasn't posted positive comps since 2007, and same-store sales have declined by roughly 4% in each of the past four years.The journey has been marked with some bizarre points, too, such as a threat to fire part-time staffersif they worked more than 25 hours in a given week.For its part, Office Depot is getting a bid higher on the news, too, with ODP shares up more than 5% in Tuesday's mid-morning trade.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTuesday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Cisco Systems, Inc.

GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Management’s Cure Is Worse Than the Disease;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack in February 2015, the CEO and co-founder ofGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), Nicholas Woodman,boasted: ""We see a future in which GoPro serves as a platform for people around the world to visually express themselves like never before. A future in which their shared experience and collective content on our platform is as valuable to GoPro, as YouTube is to Google, or Instagram is to Facebook."" And yes, GPRO stock was in hyperdrive and so was the revenue ramp, up a sizzling 75%.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)But unfortunately, this would mark the high point. During the next couple years, GPRO stock would come undone, losing more than 80% of its value.OK then, so what now? What's the future of GoPro?Good Side of GoProWell, there are actually some silver linings. In mid-March, GPRO announced anupdate on its guidance: the forecast is for non-GAAP profitability on a full-year basis and that revenues - for the current quarter - will be on the upper end of the previous outlook of $190 million to $210 million.As a result, Wall Street responded with plenty of buying, pushing GPRO stock up about 19%.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilWhile this is certainly encouraging, I think investors should still be cautious. Let's face it, GPRO has had plenty of missteps and misfires. Besides, the sentiment was already so low that any kind of good news would be a catalyst for the stock price. It's also important to keep in mind that a hefty 31% of the float for GPRO is in short positions. That is, it seems like a good bet that a part of the bull move has been the result of a ""short squeeze.""But all such things are more technical factors. Perhaps the most worrisome issue is the brutal actions GPRO has taken, such as to slash the headcount. Note that the company has plans to layoff 17% of the workforce. In fact, this is thethird reduction during the past two years.Even though the move will result in a substantial drop in operating costs, there will likely be a hit to morale. It will also mean fewer resources for critical R&D as well as staffing for sales and marketing.Keep in mind that a big issue with GPRO has been the quality of its products, as seen with the Hero4 and the Karma Drone (which had to be recalled). There was also the recentshutting downof the entertainment division.Improvements for GPRO Stock?So with the cost cutting, do you think this will mean things will get better?This seems like a stretch.Meanwhile, the competitive environment is only getting tougher. In the camera market, there are rivals likeSony Corp(ADR)(NYSE:SNE),HTC,Garmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) and evenSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP).But of course, the smartphones fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) are offering much more camera functionality. According to the GPROannual filing: ""it is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of such devices, such as Apple, Google and Samsung, may design them for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments, or develop products with features similar to ours.""Oh, and the drone market is also rife with competitors. Just some of the players includeDJI Technology Co.,Parrot SAandYuneec International Co.The Best Way to Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) at All-Time HighsGranted, GPRO stock is fairly cheap right now, with the price-to-sales ratio at only about 1X. What's more, the year-over-year comparisons with revenues and profits should be attractive this year.But such factors may not matter much if GPRO cannot get back to creating standout products. Again, this will not be easy since the company is resource constrained and must deal with a market that is crowded with many offerings. In other words, jumping into GoPro stock looks too risky right now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookas well asOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools & services for employee stock options of pre/post IPO companies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Why General Motors Company (GM) Stock Is the Best of Its Breed;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo say Monday's release of auto sales figures for March was a letdown would be a considerable understatement. They were downright alarming, resulting in sizeable losses from stocks of industry stalwarts likeFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM), as well as setbacks for shares of foreign favorites likeHonda Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:HMC) andToyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnd why not? Auto sales have been suspiciously tepid of late, and although the ""peak auto"" chatter has faded, it has never really gone away.Of the six key names that make up the vast majority of the United States automobile landscape though, one name continues to stand out as better than the rest. Keep GM stock on your watchlist, even if you have to take all the others off your radar of potential investments.GM: Tough Month for Auto SalesLong story made short, with the mostly meaningless exception ofNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY), all the major car brands in the U.S.fell short of March's sales expectations.And it's not as if the bar was set very high for most of these names. The pros were calling for Ford's sales to plunge 5.9%, and the company couldn't even do that - Ford sold 7.2% fewer automobiles than it did in March of 2016. Honda was expected to improve sales by nearly 5%, but instead posted a 0.7% decline. All told, five of the biggest eight names in the U.S. car business reported lower year-over-year sales.7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterThe end result: The annualized pace of U.S. auto sales has fallen to 16.7 million, versus an expected advance to a 17.2 million unit clip.The bullish case for the country's automakers - and the nation's preferred imports - is getting tougher and tougher to argue.With the dust settling from yesterday's lackluster March figures, though, General Motors has emerged as something of an exception to the norm. Indeed, the old-school Detroit icon may well be strong enough to keep GM stock buy-worthy even as the industry itself hits a wall.General Motors Is Doing Something RightDon't read too much into the premise. Any of the problems other automakers are facing are sure to impact General Motors to some degree as well. The question is, can GM stock shrug those issues off, even if other names in the business can't? The answer seems to be a qualified but well-founded ""yes."" A handful of details from Monday's data dump should keep General Motos stock relatively propped up.Above all else, while GM stock may have missed growth expectations by a country mile, those expectations were unfairly high. Analysts were expecting a 7% increase in unit sales for the month. General Motors still mustered a 1.6% improvement in an environment that was quite tough for cars and trucks.The compelling footnote in GM's relative victory on Monday was that it didn't come from truck sales.A closer inspection of the recent red-hot automobile market reveals thatpickup trucks rather than passenger sedanshave been doing most of the driving since 2015.While trucks (and SUVs) are more profitable for automobile companies, investors as well as the companies themselves were concerned about an over-reliance on light truck sales, and perhaps an inability to sell passenger vehicles. GM's still got that magic touch with some sedan and crossover lines though.Sales of Chevy's Equinix, Cruze and Camaro were all up, as were sales of Buick's Regal, LaCrosse and Encore.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hits New Highs, Threatens Massive BreakoutGeneral Motors also partially soothed another worry some GM stock holders may have been entertaining … it doesn't have to give buyers everything but the kitchen sink to get them to make a purchase. After being uncomfortably generous with car buyers in February, offering incentives/discounts of 14.9% of a vehicles' purchase price, General Motorsreeled that number in to only 13.5% last month. Yet, the carmaker sold 256,224 in the United States last month, up fromFebruary's tally of 237,388.Bottom Line for GM StockAgain, being the top dog of the names at the bottom of the barrel doesn't inherently mean much, as you're still at the bottom of the barrel. General Motors is clearly doing something right that its peers and competitors aren't though.To the extent the fear that upended GM stock and all the other automaker stocks yesterday wasn't fully deserved, GM shares should be the first to recover, and the best. In fact, yesterday's selloff has already started to be undone today.Clearly it's not bulletproof, but GM should at least be noted as the best of breed, for when the time is right.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q1The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement3 Entertainment Stocks to Buy as Summer ApproachesThe postWhy General Motors Company (GM) Stock Is the Best of Its Breedappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Exclusive Fool Interview: How Lucid Motors Plans to Build the Next Generation of Electric Vehicles;4/4/2017;"Silicon Valley-based electric car start-up Lucid Motors   formally exited stealth mode in December of last year when it   unveiled its new Lucid Air, a svelte all-electric luxury sedan   that will be capable of traveling 400 miles on a single charge   and have 1,000 combined horsepower between two AC induction   motors. Those are the specs that the company is targeting for the   higher-end configurations; the $60,000 (before federal tax   credit) base model will be a single-motor version that can go 240   miles before needing to charge.I happened to be in Silicon Valley last week, and Lucid was   kind enough to host me to discuss the Air, Lucid's strategy in   the years ahead, and how the company plans on building the next   generation of EVs. I spoke with Chief Technology Officer Peter   Rawlinson, who was also the chief engineer of theTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S before leaving that company half a decade   ago. Lucid even took me for a spin in an alpha prototype.Lucid Motors is decidedly a California brand. Image source:     Lucid Motors.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Here's what Rawlinson told me in an hour-long interview that   covered a wide range of topics. (Some quotes have been edited   lightly for clarity.)On patentsRawlinson was crucial in the development of the Model S and is   named as an inventor on many of Tesla's patents for its sedan.   Meanwhile, Tesla famously open-sourced its patents in 2014,   vowing not to initiate any patent lawsuits against other   companies using its technology ""in good faith."" Given Rawlinson's   familiarity with the intellectual property and the apparent   ability to use it, I wondered if Lucid was using any of Tesla's   patents.Lucid CTO Peter Rawlinson. Image source: Lucid Motors.Nope. Rawlinson says Lucid is using exactly zero of Tesla's   patents for a couple of reasons. First, Lucid is looking to   develop even better EV technology on its own, in which case it   simply doesn't need Tesla's IP. Second, it's not clear what   constitutes ""good faith"" from Tesla's perspective, and it would   be unwise and risky to build a product based on Tesla IP if there   is considerable uncertainty surrounding the usage and   implementation.Cells and chargingLucid has partnered withSamsung SDIto co-develop the battery cells that will ultimately make their   way into Lucid battery packs. All battery cells degrade over   time due to a variety of factors like depth of discharge or   environmental conditions, to name a few, so the universal goal is   to minimize potential degradation. Rawlinson says these new cells   are designed to withstand and minimize degradation: ""The   cell chemistry that we've co-developed with Samsung is   groundbreaking in that it is very tolerant to repeated, cyclic   fast-charging.""Samsung SDI will be the primary production partner, but Lucid   is also working with a couple other prominent suppliers. Lucid   will assemble the battery packs in-house, which will feature an   advanced cooling system and industry-leading energy density.So much for fighting over who rides shotgun. Image source:     Lucid Motors.There are currently three prominent DC fast-charging standards   throughout the world (China is working on a fourth), including   Tesla's proprietary Superchargers that were born out of necessity   given how immature charging standards and networks were back   then. ""Tesla took a leading role, it was the vanguard really, in   creating a fast-charging network, and is to be applauded for   that,"" Rawlinson adds.Lucid hasn't picked a horse in this race quite yet. That's   because the company is still at least two years away from   production, and the charging landscape will inevitably shift by   then. It looks like CCS is going to win out (CHAdeMO has been in   decline for years), and Rawlinson thinks that's the route Lucid   will take, but it has plenty of time to figure out which   standard(s) to support (with adaptors if need be). ""I think that   we will see a maturity and proliferation of [the CCS] charging   network by then,"" says Rawlinson.We can all agree that the last thing the EV industry needs is   yet another charging standard for consumers to navigate.Direct sales and serviceRawlinson also gives Tesla credit for pushing forward with   direct sales and service. As such, Lucid also plans on operating   its own network of retail stores and service centers, according   to Rawlinson:We plan to create a network of stores and a service network.     Now, that will have to grow organically as sales grow. Before     launch, we're planning our first store, probably in the Bay     Area. And we'll grow that network in a synchronous manner with     sales. And yes, that will be challenging to start with, of     course.Given how antiquated the traditional dealer model is, having   more companies advocating for direct sales -- an unfortunately   litigious endeavor -- is good news for consumers.About that $700 million factoryThere have been plenty of headlines that Lucid is planning to   build a $700 million factory in Arizona, which raises an   inevitable question: Where is all that money going to come   from?Lucid Air has four displays that serve different purposes.     Image source: Lucid Motors.It's worth clarifying that Lucid isnotplanning on spending $700 million upfront, which would be   reckless. Instead, the manufacturing facility will have three   phases, the first of which is expected to cost $240 million. That   should allow the company to ramp up to producing about 8,000 to   10,000 vehicles per year, with production commencing in 2019.   Only after all three stages are completed (expected around 2022   if all goes well) will the total investment reach $700 million.   At that point, the factory should have annual production capacity   of 130,000 vehicles.Lucid is currently working to secure its Series D financing   round; once the funding is secured, then Lucid will break ground   in the Grand Canyon state.How Lucid will approach autonomyIn terms of autonomous driving, Lucid plans on using an   ""overlay of LIDAR, radar, and camera"" for the hardware sensor   suite. The company recently announced that it is partnering withMobileye, whichIntelis looking to acquire in a blockbuster$15.3 billion dealannounced last month.Lucid will use both long- and short-range versions of all   sensors: wide-angle cameras, telephoto cameras, and long/short   range radar and LIDAR sensors for maximum redundancy. Instead of   using roof-mounted LIDAR systems, Lucid plans on using peripheral   LIDAR sensors embedded into the sides of the vehicle; software   will stitch the data together. This has functional benefits as   well as aesthetic ones (no one will be calling the Lucid Air anugly potatoanytime soon). Rawlinson said:The three technical aspects of making autonomous driving     work, in my view, are: the platform in terms of hardware --     that's the car, all the sensors, the whole integration of that     suite. Are we going to do that? Yes. Software, are we going to     do that? No, we're going to partner. And the third thing is big     data. Are we going to do that? Yes. Because we will be able to     collect and accrue big data.Rawlinson reiterated that Lucid is quite cognizant of how   difficult it is to bring a car to market, and it doesn't make   sense to invest in autonomous driving software at this stage. The   company needs to remain ""laser-focused"" on the car itself in   terms of hardware and getting to production, which is mostly what   its roughly 300 engineers work on.Lucid isn't trying to ""kill"" TeslaThere's a tendency to frame Lucid as a ""Tesla killer,"" but   such comparisons miss the point. Rawlinson clarifies, ""This car   isn't a Model S competitor; it's the next step forward. I   certainly don't see it as a 'Tesla killer.'"" Of course, Lucid   will compete with Tesla on some level, but the main rivals will   be the German automakers that dominate the $100 billion luxury   segment of the market.""What we've tried to do is create the next generation of car,""   Rawlinson said.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Best Stocks for 2017: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Still a Tech Leader;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEditor's note: This column is part of ourBest Stocks for 2017contest. Louis Navellier's pick for the contest isNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).makeArticleAd();We're officially through the first quarter, and shares ofNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) - my top stock for 2017 - finished the quarter with a modest 2% gain. That performance seems like nothing to write home about, especially when compared with theS&P 500'snearly 6% gain. However, when it comes to the computer graphics company, I predict that a little patience will pay off big time. In fact, now is an excellent time to pick up NVDA stock before it explodes higher.I'll explain exactly why in a moment, but first, let's review what weighed on the stock earlier in the quarter. Back in early February, Nvidia released perfectly respectable fourth-quarter results, including 55% sales growth, 193% EPS growth and a healthy 19.3% earnings surprise.Nonetheless, some shareholders took the earnings report as an excuse to lock in their gains - a shortsighted move, in my opinion.NVDA shares meandered lower through early March. Then, a series of exciting announcements and analyst upgrades renewed interest in the stock …Catalysts for NVDA StockIn mid-March, Nvidia revealed that it designed the custom applications processor for theNintendo's(OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Switch videogame console. Since its March 3 debut, the Nintendo Switch has been selling so well that Nintendo has decided to double its planned production for the current fiscal year. This is expected to boost Nvidia's own sales and earnings.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilThat same week, NVDA also announced that it's teaming up withPACCAR, a leading global truck manufacturer, to develop self-driving trucks. The two companies have already built a proof-of-concept self-driving truck that is powered by Nvidia's Drive PX 2 technology. There are currently 300 million trucks on the road around the world, representing a massive untapped market.NVDA stock is clearly doubling down on self-driving cars; it already has partnerships with many leading automakers, includingAudi,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Mercedes-Benz,Volvo,Honda Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:HMC) andBMW. As self-driving cars become more widely adopted, Nvidia's artificial intelligence car computing platform will be in hot demand.Then in late March,TenCent(OTCMKTS:TCEHY), one of China's largest internet service providers, announced that it will be using Nvidia's Tesla GPU accelerators with its cloud computing platform. In laymen's terms, TenCent will be relying on NVDA's industry-leading hardware to supercharge its cloud services.As a pioneer of artificial computing technology, Nvidia's products are already used by plenty of cloud service providers, enterprises and research organizations. However, having TenCent's buy-in is a big deal. With nearly $22 billion in annual revenue, the company operates the world's largest gaming platform.These developments build upon Nvidia's already strong sales and earnings prospects. This quarter, NVDA stock is expected to post 103% earnings growth and 46.3% sales growth.The Best Way to Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) at All-Time HighsThen again, most analysts have been aggressively revising their estimates higher, so it seems like the sky is the limit. And I'm not the only one who thinks so. At the time of writing this, NVDA stock rebounded nearly 12% from its recent lows before taking a hit on Tuesday after a Pacific Crest downgrade.From self-driving cars to virtual reality to artificial intelligence, Nvidia is at the forefront of several fast-growing technologies. In my opinion, the stock's first-quarter performance isn't indicative of its true potential. I still consider NVDA one of my top technology plays for 2017.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

Why Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW) Stock Will Keep Running Higher;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are a lot of reasons to likeLowe's Companies, Inc.(NYSE:LOW) stock at the moment. And that hasn't always been the case. LOW stock traditionally has underperformed that of its key rival,Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD). Even excluding HD's higher dividend yield, investors in HD stock have received about 30 percentage points more return over the last five years than their counterparts in Lowe's stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)But LOW stock may be positioned to outperform HD stock - and the market overall - going forward.Lowe's stock has a number of catalysts in its favor at the moment. With a bit of cooperation from the housing markets, LOW stock should be one of the better-performing large-caps over the next few years.Strong Quarter and Year for LOW StockLowe's stock jumped 9.5% after the company's first-quarter report in early March, and with good reason. Results were strong across the board. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.86 crushed consensus expectations of $0.79, and increased a sharp 46% year-over-year. Even considering some likely help from better weather in key markets, that's a huge earnings increase for an established company. Full-year adjusted EPS rose 21%, with same-store sales up 4.2%, including a 5.1% jump in Q4.Admittedly, Lowe's same-store sales in Q4 were a bit below those of HD, but the gap is smaller than it has been of late. Meanwhile, guidance for 3.5% comps looks possibly conservative, and Lowe's expects to turn those revenues into a 16% increase in earnings per share - even with FY16 (ending January 2017) having an extra week, and thus a tougher comparison. And it certainly appears that Lowe's stock has room to grow considerably beyond just next year.The 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q1Can Lowe's Stock Outperform HD Stock?Looking forward, there are a number of multi-year catalysts behind LOW stock. The gap between Home Depot and Lowe's in terms of revenue seems to be narrowing. Home Depot outperformed LOW stock by 200 bps for the full year, but just 70 bps in Q4. The nature of incremental margins are such that if Lowe's can grab a few more dollars from its rival, its earnings should expand nicely.Meanwhile, the housing cycle seems to imply a tailwind for both LOW stock and HD. Housing starts numbers have been solid so far in 2017, and renovation activity appears to be picking up as well. Both bode well for sales to not only do-it-yourself individual customers, but the large-volume commercial clients that drive a good chunk of Lowe's revenue.And there's one more, somewhat hidden, catalyst: The continuing decline ofSears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD). Sears competes with Lowe's in both hardware and appliances. And the revenue being shed by thatstruggling company- both through store closures and declining same-store sales - has to go somewhere. Sears (not including Kmart) saw revenue decline by $1.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year. Some of those lost sales will make their way to Lowe's.In fact, one analyst has estimateda 50-plus basis point tailwindto comparable sales for both Lowe's and Home Depoteach yearfrom Sears' struggles. And with the decline at that retailer not likely to end any time soon, if ever, that benefit should persist for some time.Bottom Line on LOWAnd yet, Lowe's stock is priced very reasonably. LOW trades at about 15x its FY17 guidance of $4.64. In comparison, HD trades at over 18x its guidance and a two-turn premium on an EV/EBITDA basis, as well.If Lowe's can narrow the growth gap - as it has done of late - the valuation gap between LOW stock and HD should narrow in turn. A 19x multiple plus the 1.7% dividend paid by Lowe's stock implies about a 9% return over the next year. Any outperformance, or strength in the industry as a whole, puts total return into the double-digits on a percentage basis.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hits New Highs, Threatens Massive BreakoutAnd I'd expect some outperformance this year - and perhaps a rising tide for both HD and LOW in terms of earnings and multiples. Consumer confidence is up. Home builders are optimistic. Few, if any, retailers have the same protection from e-commerce andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Lowe's stock is near an all-time high, but hitting $100 by 2018 hardly seems an outrageous expectation. A 19-20x multiple - up modestly due to rising optimism - and $5+ in 2018 EPS gets the stock into the triple digits.That's a 20%+ return in as little as a year, and that's worth paying attention to. And so is LOW stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right Now7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second Quarter3 Entertainment Stocks to Buy as Summer ApproachesThe postWhy Lowe's Companies, Inc.

3 Top Driverless Car Stocks to Buy Now;4/4/2017;"I won't bore you with the statistics about self-driving cars.   At least, not yet. First, consider this 2015 quote about the   future of driverless cars fromTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk:You'll be able to tell your car, ""Take me home,"" go here, go     there, or anything, and it'll just do it. It'll be an order of     magnitude safer than a person. In the distant future, people     may outlaw driving cars because it's too dangerous. You can't     have a person driving a two-ton death machine.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();That opinion may seem a bit extreme to some, but self-driving   cars have the potential to reduce vehicular deaths by (here come   the stats now) 90% by mid-century. In the U.S. alone, that means   nearly 30,000 lives would be saved every year.That's one of the reasons why so many automakers and   technology companies are investing billions of dollars to get   autonomous vehicles on the road, and why investors should pay   attention. To help you get started in the space, let's look at   three companies that are each taking different approaches to the   self-driving car market -- and that have lots of potential to   benefit from it.IntelIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) wasn't exactly the first company people were   thinking about in this space until very recently. That changed   when it purchased the leader in advanced driver assistance   systems (ADAS),Mobileye(NYSE: MBLY) , for $15.3 billion.That's a hefty price tag, but what Intel is getting for it may   end up being worth it. Advanced driver assistance systems -- with   features such as lane detection and correction, automatic   braking, and automatic speed adjustments -- are the precursors to   much of the technology that will underlie fully autonomous   vehicles, and Mobileye has about 65% of the ADAS market.   Purchasing it gave Intel a central position in autonomous vehicle   technologies that it didn't have just a month ago; it could also   help the company sell more of its processors.Processors for PCs have been Intel's No. 1 revenue   driver, but with sales of desktops and laptops continuing to   decline, the company has been looking for new segments that it   can sell its chips to. The automotive semiconductor market is   expected to reach $36 billion by 2018,and if Intel can use   Mobileye to both sell self-driving technologies to automakers and   boost sales of its own processors, then the company may have   finally found its next big market opportunity.QualcommIf Intel's pending purchase of Mobileye signals a move from   the post-PC and post-mobile era for chipmakers, then considerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)  one of theleaders of that movement.At the end of last year, Qualcomm made a $39 billion bid forNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which is still pending. The move would do much   to bring Qualcomm into the driverless car space by adding NXP's   own self-driving technologies to the chipmaker's lineup.NXP debuted anoff-the-shelf driverless car systemlast year called BlueBox, which includes sensors, cameras,   algorithms, and processors that allow cars to function at Level 4   automation by 2020. (Level 5 is the highest classification for a   fully autonomous vehicle.)Qualcomm has hit a few bumps as it works to close the NXP   deal, but that appears to still be on track to happen later this   year. When it does, Qualcomm could end up in a similar position   to Intel, with a handful of key driverless car technologies in   its arsenal and new opportunities to sell its processors into   driverless cars.TeslaI couldn't lead off this list with an Elon Musk quote without   eventually talking about everything Tesla is doing in the   semi-autonomous car space.First of all, Tesla has added driverless car hardware to all   of its new vehicles, and has beenrolling out software updatesas they are developed to bring new semi-autonomous features to   vehicle owners. Tesla is the only automaker that's taking   such a bold step with semi-autonomous hardware, which could end   up helping the company take the lead in driverless cars a few   years from now.Musk mentioned in the second version of hisTesla Master Planlast year that vehicles owners will be able to ""summon your Tesla   from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able   to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.""   Tesla is still a while away from that goal, but it's clearly   positioning itself as the leading semi-autonomous automaker.The driverless car market is expected to be worth $77 billion   by 2035, but there areplenty of thingsthat could end up holding these companies back. Still, investors   would be wise to consider the above companies when looking at   driverless car stocks -- and remember that patient investors will   likely see the biggest returns.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Zacks analyst points to the company's continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products. The recent announcement of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based gaming service, will help Microsoft to win market share from the likes of GameStop.All in all, the company has emerged as a leader in the cloud space that promises momentum on a number of fronts. Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's fiscal Q3 earnings release. However, a strong U.S. dollar and stiff competition remain major concerns.

The company is focused on geographical expansions and acquisitions for growth. Tesla also remains on track with its Model 3 production. Tesla reported record deliveries in the first quarter of 2017.The company continues to generate a lot of passion among investors; it has an avid fan base, but also plenty of detractors. The detractors simply don't see any justification for the stock's lofty valuation given the niche nature of the product and the well-known operational and strategic headwinds facing the company.

The Zacks analyst likes the company's efforts to generate positive operating leverage through its cost-saving initiatives. Also, management projects revenues to rise at a mid-single digit rate in 2017, aided by loan growth. Further, its deal to acquire the commercial and vendor finance business of ECN Capital is expected to be marginally accretive to earnings in 2017.Further, given its strong balance sheet, the company's capital deployment activities are impressive. Though the company increased its prime lending rate to 4.00% following the latest Fed rate hike, margin pressure is not expected to ease drastically in the upcoming quarters. Also, stringent regulatory requirements will likely hurt the company's profitability and business flexibility in the near term.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO);4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointed lower once again this morning, as Wall Street frets ahead of a meeting later this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting could be tense, as Trump has labeled China a currency manipulator and, more recently, said the U.S. could go it alone when dealing with North Korea. Elsewhere, economic data today includes reports on U.S. trade deficit and factory orders.makeArticleAd();At last check,Dow Jones Industrial Averagefutures were down 0.25%,S&P 500futures had fallen 0.35% andNasdaq-100futures were lower by 0.41%.On the options front, volume arrived just below average for the past three months, with about 12.7 million calls and 11.3 million puts changing hands yesterday. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio bounced to 0.67, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.64 for a fourth consecutive session.Driving Monday's options volume,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) is beginning to see some fraying on the edges of its bullish sentiment outlook, as Vetr and Citigroup both downgraded BAC stock. Elsewhere, call options picked up steam onTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) after the company issued strong first-quarter deliveries, whileCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) drew over-the-top call volume ahead of today's ex-dividend date.Bank of America Corp (BAC)If you were starting to think that BAC stock's rally was long-in-the-tooth, you're not alone. Analysts atVetr downgradedthe shares from ""strong buy"" to ""buy"" yesterday, andCitigroup cut BAC stockto ""neutral"" from ""buy"" bright and early this morning. The bulk of analysts still maintain a positive outlook on BAC stock, however, as Thomson/First Call reports that 24 of the 31 brokerage firms following the shares rate them a ""buy"" or better.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilOptions traders were not deterred by yesterday's downgrade. BAC saw volume top 743,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 65% of the day's take. What's more, short-term options are also betting on a continued BAC stock rally. Specifically, the April put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.53, with calls nearly doubling puts among options set to expire this month.BAC has struggled of late, dipping below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages. But April options traders are still betting that the stock will close north of $26 before expiration, as more than 149,000 contracts currently reside at this front-month strike.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla is on track to hit is first-quarter deliveries goals. Over the weekend, the company said it delivered justmore than 25,000 vehicles for the quarter, putting Tesla a little over halfway to its first-half deliveries target of between 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles. Hitting delivery targets will be a major driver for TSLA stock this year, as Tesla ramps up production for the Model 3.TSLA stock jumped more than 7% on the news, pushing Tesla to a record high and eclipsingFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) as the No 2. U.S. automaker in terms of market cap. The news helped spur options volume on the day to more than 616,000 contracts, marking a near-term high in speculative activity. Calls accounted for 57% of the day's take.Despite the boost in confidence, short-term traders remain largely ambivalent toward TSLA stock. For instance, the April put/call OI ratio of 1.16 indicates that puts outnumber calls among short-term options. That said, peak put OI for the series totals 4,875 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $250 strike, and is mostly likely comprised of protective puts and put sell positions instead of outright bets that TSLA shares will decline.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)CSCO stock was flooded with call activity on Friday, and a little digging reveals that the most likely culprit is the fact that the shares are trading ex-dividend today. Shareholders of record as of the close on Monday are eligible for a cash dividend of 29 cents per share payable on April 26.The effect on CSCO's options pits was immediately apparent, as calls made up 94% of the more than 278,000 contracts traded on Monday, with all activity likely geared toward dividend capture strategies.Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) Stock Is the Best in RetailUnfortunately for CSCO stockholders, the dividend is likely the only joy they'll see for a while. Cisco had a banner month in February, but the shares have spent the past several weeks fighting for support in the $34 region.That battle now appears to be lost, with CSCO drifting further below $34 with every session. In fact, it may be time to take a look at potentiallyshorting CSCO stock.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Biggest Land Mines in Your Portfolio Right NowThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Keeps Getting Smoked by Domino's Pizza, Inc.

Tesla (TSLA) Runs Over Naysayers, Races Past Ford in Market Cap;4/4/2017;"Tesla (Shutterstock photo)“Doubt” has been worn like a badge of honor by naysayers when placing bets against Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. How’s that playing out? Smart investors, on the other hand — those who have latched onto Musk’s promises — have gotten rich calling shotgun. For your sake, you were on the right side of the trade Monday.Tesla stock raced more than 7% higher Monday, reaching to an all-time high of $299. The stock, which has has already soared 40% year to date, besting the 5% rise in the S&P 500 index, has pushed Tesla ahead of Ford (F) in terms of market cap. The California-based electric vehicle company, which on Sunday said it delivered 25,000 cars in the first quarter, is now valued at about $3B more than Ford, which sold more than 236,000 cars in March alone.makeArticleAd();At it current pace, Tesla — only fourteen years old — is poised to surpass 120-year old General Motors (GM), which has a market cap $51 billion as of Monday’s close. Tesla has punished the short sellers, who held almost 20% of the float as of March 15. These days, “doubt” — that once distinctive emblem, purported to be intelligence — has been replaced by the marks of tire treads as Tesla continues to run over its enemies and its own estimates.On January 3 — when TSLA stock traded at around $213 — I made a case for why the shares would be dominant in 2017,posting as much as 60% returns. Much of the optimism was based on the premise that Musk would make good on his promise that Model 3 deliveries will begin in 2017. Tesla’s ability to deliver $35,000 Model 3 vehicles would inject significant cash flow to the company’s given there is a waiting list of about 400,000 people who have each paid a $1,000 as a registration fee.Beyond the Model 3, on Sunday not only did Tesla top its own delivery forecast of 23,000 to 24,500 vehicles, marking an almost 70% rise year over year, the company now expects to deliver between 47,000 to 50,000 cars in the first half of 2017. “This [47,000 delivery target] bodes well for the company and should add to recent positive sentiment for Tesla's fundamental performance,” said CFRA Research analyst Efriam Levy.All told, the fortunes of Tesla and the credibility of Elon Musk have taken a right turn. And while Tesla is still losing money taking on larger players Ford and GM, which are both deep-pocketed, it is TSLA investors who are cruising all the way to the bank. Seatbelts are optional."

The Nasdaq Suggests it’s Time to Pick Your Stocks Carefully;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Monday, the second quarter ended with mild selling. A late-afternoon rally failed to overcome early profit taking, which followed the biggest quarterly gain since 2015. TheDow Jones Industrial Averagefell 0.1% and theS&P 500dropped 0.2%. Small- and mid-caps, as represented by theRussell 2000and theNasdaq, fell 1.2% and 0.3% respectively.makeArticleAd();Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) reported a Q1 jump in sales of 69% vs. last year, vaulting the company to second place among auto manufacturers, by market capitalization, droppingFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) to third place. TSLA's stock jumped 7.3% following the report. All other auto makers reported losses ranging from -0.1% forToyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM) to -4.8% forFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE:FCAU).U.S. factory-sector health, as measured by data from the Institute for Supply Management's PMI, was down fractionally compared to February.Crude oil (WTI) fell 36 cents or 0.7% but managed to close above $50 per barrel despite a resumption of production from Libya. WTI had advanced four straight sessions last week due to a cut of 1/3 of Libya output.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilAt the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points at 20,650, the S&P 500 shed 4, ending at 2,359, the Nasdaq lost 17 to close at 5,895, and the Russell 2000 closed at 1,370 for a loss of 16 points (-1.17%).

Yesterday's mid-cap chart of theSPDR S&P Midcap 400 ETF(NYSEARCA:MDY) shows a nasty failure to follow through on Friday's fractional advance, which held the ETF above its 50-day moving average. Yesterday's failure not only closed below the blue line but failed on higher-than-normal volume. The next support line is at the several closes at about $307 and then the major support line at $302.Conclusion:It is clearly time to raise some cash. However, as pointed out by Jeff Saut, Raymond James' Chief Investment Strategist, ""But given the widespread wariness, the huge cash pile on the sideline and improving fundamentals, the correction will prove to be more of a rotational/time correction rather than magnitude. Accordingly, emphasis should be on stock selection.""The stock market rarely does exactly what we expect it to do, thus spacing the commitment of that cash to buying at the several support lines is probably a better tactic than going back in all at once. I believe, however, that now is the time to raise cash on all high-P/E stocks that a trader owns.

Tesla Stock Nears $300: What Investors Need to Know;4/3/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is surging on Monday, following the   company'srecord first-quarter deliveries. Shares are up about 6.6% at the time of the writing, trading at   about $297. The rise adds to the stock's roaring gains recently,   with shares up an impressive 63% since Dec. 1.As the stock hits a new all-time high on Monday and nears   $300, it's a good time take a step back and consider what's   behind the rising stock price -- and what it means for   investors.Tesla Model X (left) and Model S (right). Image source.     Tesla.makeArticleAd();Tesla's Model X is a hitAs vehicle sales soar 69% year over year in Tesla's most   recent quarter, one recent and undeniable key driver for the   company is its late-2015 launched Model X SUV.After its launch in 2015, there were lots of doubts about both   Tesla's ability to produce such a complex vehicle and about how   demand for the Model X's flashy falcon wing doors would fare.   Further, Tesla's first few quarters of worse-than-expected Model   X production -- as management cited ""hubris in adding far too   much new technology to the Model X in version 1"" -- didn't help   concerns about the vehicle's potential.However, with Model X deliveries in the company's first   quarter of 2017 up 318% year over year, Tesla has proven it can   both ramp up production and build the vehicle in meaningful   volumes. Tesla delivered a record 11,550 Model X units in its   first quarter, up from 2,400 units in the year-ago quarter.Data source: Tesla's quarterly SEC filings and delivery     updates. Chart by author.Model 3 is comingAnother key driver in Tesla's stock recently is management's   ability to stick to its aggressive timeline for its upcoming   Model 3 so far. In early 2016, management was still saying it   didn't expect Model 3 production to begin until ""late 2017."" But   after announcing in May last year that management was moving its   target for annualized production of 500,000 units two years   earlier, from 2020 to 2018, the company has also been moving its   Model 3 launch timeframe earlier.Now Tesla is aiming for Model 3 production to begin in July.   In addition, Tesla is maintaining its aggressive guidance for a   500,000-unit annualized build rate next year. Notably, Tesla is   only building about 100,000 units annually today, so even if   Tesla fell short of its target to build 500,000 vehicles in 2018   by 150,000 units, production would still soar.With Tesla delivering strong Model S and Model X deliveries in   the first quarter, and management setting the stage for Model 3,   investors are betting on hockey-stick-like growth in the   company's underlying business.Tesla stock's valuation implies monstrous growthAs shares hit a fresh high, investors should keep in mind that   the stock's valuation is now essentially betting on not only   excellent execution with the Model 3, but also sustained growth   in the company's overall business for years to come.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.To better grasp the massive future growth priced into Tesla   stock, consider that the electric-car maker has sold about 86,500   vehicles in the trailing 12 months, yet its market capitalization   of $48.4 billion is several billion dollars greater thanFord's at the time of this writing. And Ford, of course, sells   millions of vehicles per year -- 6.65 million in 2016, to be   exact.Of course, Tesla is betting on more than vehicle sales to   boost its business. Indeed, that's why the company recently   dropped ""Motors"" from its name. Tesla is betting itsfast-growing energy storage business, 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, andrapid deployment of autonomous vehicle   technologywill all become significant growth drivers.Given the speculative nature of the growth expectations built   into Tesla's stock price today, investors should consider risks   associated with the stock carefully before buying.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Top Research Reports for Today: MSFT, TSLA, PNC;4/3/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Monday, April 3, 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) and PNC Financial (PNC).Microsoftshares lagged the Zacks Tech sector through the fall, but have led the way over the last six months (up +15.3% versus +8.9%) on greater appreciation for the company's reorganization and repositioning. The Zacks analyst points to the company's continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products. The recent announcement of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based gaming service, will help Microsoft to win market share from the likes of GameStop.All in all, the company has emerged as a leader in the cloud space that promises momentum on a number of fronts. Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's fiscal Q3 earnings release. However, a strong U.S. dollar and stiff competition remain major concerns. (You canread the full research report onMicrosoft here.)Shares ofTeslahave been standout performers lately, with the stock up +22.6% over the past three months vs. +0.3% gain for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry. The company is focused on geographical expansions and acquisitions for growth. Tesla also remains on track with its Model 3 production. Tesla reported record deliveries in the first quarter of 2017.The company continues to generate a lot of passion among investors; it has an avid fan base, but also plenty of detractors. The detractors simply don't see any justification for the stock's lofty valuation given the niche nature of the product and the well-known operational and strategic headwinds facing the company. (You canread the full research report onTeslahere.)PNC Financialoutperformed the Zacks Regional Banks industry, over the last six months gaining +32.9% vs. +30.2%. The Zacks analyst likes the company's efforts to generate positive operating leverage through its cost-saving initiatives. Also, management projects revenues to rise at a mid-single digit rate in 2017, aided by loan growth. Further, its deal to acquire the commercial and vendor finance business of ECN Capital is expected to be marginally accretive to earnings in 2017.Further, given its strong balance sheet, the company's capital deployment activities are impressive. Though the company increased its prime lending rate to 4.00% following the latest Fed rate hike, margin pressure is not expected to ease drastically in the upcoming quarters. Also, stringent regulatory requirements will likely hurt the company's profitability and business flexibility in the near term.

The company achieved 25,000 deliveries to mark a 69% increase   over the prior-year period and a set new quarterly record. Tesla   also revealed that it produced 25,418 vehicles in the quarter,   which also set a record.The sales figures put the company on track to meet the first   phase of its 2017 targets, given that CEO Elon Musk and his team   forecast deliveries of 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X   vehicles through the first six months of the year. Meanwhile,   it's good news for shareholders that Tesla's growth is closely   tracking management's expectations. The companymissed its guidanceat the last quarterly outing and, while its explanation pointed   to temporary production problems, some investors worried that the   miss had more to do with demand than supply. Instead, record   delivery figures add weight to the company's claim that drivers   are snapping up its luxury vehicles at a healthy pace.Some of Tesla's biggest challenges lie ahead, though.   Beginning in the second half of this year the company will ramp   up production for its first mass-market automobile. It will   significantly lower the company's average selling prices, since   it should start at $35,000, or about half that of a Model S. But   the Model 3's success will be pivotal to Tesla's goal of reaching   a production volume of 500,000 vehicles per year by 2018.Panera Bread's acquisition rumorPanera Bread stock soared close to 8% following news that the   company is exploring the possibility of a sale.

Tesla Shares Surge to Record Highs on Strong Deliveries;4/3/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) sure had a busy first quarter. Over the weekend,   the electric-car maker announced its production and delivery   numbers for the past three months. Tesla delivered 25,000   vehicles during the quarter (up 69% year over year), consisting   of 13,450 Model S sedans and about 11,550 Model X SUVs.   Production in the first quarter came in at 25,418, and there were   4,650 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter.That total delivery count represents a new quarterly record   for Tesla. The news has sent shares surging to fresh all-time   highs, hitting $294.15 earlier this morning, a few dollars higher   than the prior all-time high of approximately $291 set in   September 2014.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Model X production is improvingTesla has long said that the Model X could very well be the   most difficult vehicle in the world to manufacture, in part   because the company jammed so many features into it. That hurt   the initial production ramp when Model X launched in late 2015,   and Tesla owned its ""hubris"" in over-designing the electric SUV;   CEO Elon Musk has even previously compared Model X to a Faberge   egg. The proportion of deliveries that are Model X is now growing   as Tesla makes progress with actually producing the vehicle.Data source: SEC filings and author's calculations. Chart by     author.U.S. consumer preferences have been gravitating toward SUVs   and luxury SUVs for years, so Tesla improving its Model X   production capabilities should help it better meet that   demand.Guidance is within reachThe first-quarter total puts Tesla in a good position to hit   its guidance target for the first half of 2017. The company said   in February that it was expecting to deliver 47,000 to 50,000   vehicles (Model S and Model X combined) in the first half ahead   of the planned start of Model 3 production in July.If you include the vehicles in transit that will be delivered   during the second quarter, Tesla is almost up to 30,000   deliveries year to date. For context, Tesla exited the fourth   quarter with6,450 vehiclesin transit that were included in first-quarter deliveries.Tesla is now the second-most valuable U.S. automakerTesla's market cap briefly overtookFord's last week, but shares of major automakers are down today   following poor March sales even as incentives were on the rise.   Most manufacturers missed relative to market expectations. That   puts Tesla's market cap around $47.6 billion as Ford's has fallen   to $45.2 billion.GMis currently worth about $51 billion.Of course, each company's respective valuation metrics are   worlds apart, as the majority of Tesla's value remains predicated   on its future potential.

Biggest Risks With Options Investing;4/3/2017;"WithSnap's(NYSE: SNAP) recent IPO and ensuing lofty valuation, many     investors are wondering if now might be a good time to short     the social media/camera company. But while options are a safer     bet than shorting, they are not without risks.In this clip,Motley Fool Optionsexpert JP Bennett explains some of the most important risks and     complications involved with options, especially using them to     short a company. Also, he explains a few critical things that     investors should know before diving into options investing and     where investors can look online to learn more.makeArticleAd();A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock         tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they         have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Tesla wasn't one of         them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even         better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This video was recorded on March 24, 2017.Dylan Lewis:One of the reasons we started talking about options on the show     is that a lot of people had been looking at Snapchat and     saying, ""This is a company that a lot of people are bearish on,     should I short it?"" And we had introduced the idea that, I'm     generally against shorting because it opens you up to a ton of     downside risk. And you'll see people use options as a     limited-downside way to do some of the similar types of betting     against a stock.JP Bennett:Yeah, but there's no risk-free lunch. There are definitely     things to consider when you're using it to make a bearish bet.     In the case of Snapchat, what I would suspect in terms of the     option premiums, especially for the puts, if there are a lot of     bearish investors and they don't want to short, they want to     play through options, those puts are going to cost a pretty     penny. One example that is so crystal clear in my mind because     it was one of the first instances of seeing how options can be     influenced by short interest and what's happening in a stock is     to go back in the early days ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , when it was $15-$30. What you saw, even back     then, there were a ton of people that said, ""This stock is     worthless, they're not going to do it."" So, there was a really     high short interest. Essentially, the cost to borrow, you have     to pay a fee to borrow those shares to sell them on the market     and short -- that was becoming pretty prohibitive, in terms of     your potential return, because you're paying that fee. So, what     a lot of people did it is, they shifted over into the options     market, and were using options to make bearish bets against     Tesla. Now, what ended up happening was, because so many people     were doing that, basically, the premiums got skewed so heavily     that the normal rules or things you see happening in the     options market in terms of pricing just got thrown completely     out of whack, and it really wasn't even that attractive to go     bearish. It was actually really attractive to go longTesla stockthrough options, because those puts cost so much money because     it's something that everybody wanted to do. So, that's     something that, you can use it to make bearish bets on     companies, but if it's a really crowded trade, you also have to     be very mindful, you have to be extremely mindful of how much     you're paying or how much you're collecting.Lewis:Yeah, I think the important thing to remember is, like other     financial instruments, there is the intrinsic value side of     things, but there's also the market sentiment that plays a role     in the price that you're paying for it.Bennett:Yeah. Options, just like with investing, they are tools that     can be used to create a lot of good, but they can also be used     as tool of weapons of mass destruction, and completely destroy     your portfolio. But, because they are leveraged instruments,     you can do an extremely short order.Lewis:I think that might be a good segue into my next question. What     are some other things people should know about options? Or,     maybe some misconceptions about them? Or, before you do     anything with options, please know this?Bennett:Before you do anything with options, you really have to get a     hang of the lingo, what goes into a strategy, the payoffs for     particular strategies, and really what's at stake. Yes, it is     investing. Yes, the underlying instrument is the stock. But,     there are definitely noticeable differences, in terms of buying     to open, writing contracts, the lingo, how things behave over     time based on what the stock is doing. If you don't go into it     having a pretty good grasp of that, you can get overwhelmed     pretty quickly. Getting a good knowledge base -- forOptions, the service that I work on, we have what is called Options U,     Options University. We always tell members, ""Go through the     educational material first. Make sure you're extremely     comfortable with everything. Potentially even open up a paper     trading account just to get familiar with how everything works.     Move extremely slowly, and make sure you're extremely     comfortable with what you're doing before you do anything.""The next thing is something we've touched on a couple times.     Never forget that these are leveraged instruments, in terms of,     you're buying it, or potentially selling 100 shares of stock.     You can think of it and go, ""Man, I'm selling these puts, I'm     generating $1 per share, that's 100 shares per contract, that's     nice, but this stock isn't going to fall that far. These puts     are way out in the money, so let me sell 15."" So, instead of     dealing with 100 shares, you're now dealing with 1,500. The     risk there, depending on how high the stock is, currently,     that's a pretty significant chunk of change that you may have     to be on the hook for, because anything can and will happen in     the financial markets. So, always stay humble and never get     greedy. We prefer to sell options more than we buy them. We can     get into why we do that a little bit more. But, because of     that, like I said, we're the insurance company, we're taking     the other side of that trade. And although it works out more     often than not, you're generating a lot of income, and it can     become pretty easy if you're not disciplined to say, ""Man, the     last 10 trades I did worked out great. I am a genius at this,""     and then you go, ""I'm going to slowly increase the number of     contracts I write over time,"" and before you know it, you're in     over your head, and then maybe the market falls, or one or two     of the stocks you were using options on tank. Then you're just     up the creek without a paddle.Lewis:Yeah. I think a lot about the 13 steps to investing that we     have on fool.com. That's the intro to buying stocks and things     like that. One of the pieces of advice early on is to buy your     first stock, just buy one share. Buy a really small position,     maybe just one share, and follow it for a little while and see     what happens, and understand what makes stocks move, what     people are looking for in that company, and then take larger     and larger bites as you become more familiar. It sounds like     your advice for dipping your toe into options is exactly the     same.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Tesla.JP Bennetthas no position in any stocks mentioned.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock Is a No-Doubt Buy After Deliveries Beat;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe fortunes ofTesla, Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) have made a sudden right turn, and there appear to be few speed bumps in sight. Yes, Tesla stock isn't exactly a bargain right now - especially in the midst of a 30%-plus year-to-date run, topped by a 4% increase on Monday - but at this point, you shouldn't hold your breath waiting for a cheaper price.makeArticleAd();In a press release Sunday,Tesla announced it delivered just more than 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter. The deliveries total - which marks a company record - topped Wall Street estimates, which ranged anywhere between 23,000 and 24,500 vehicles. For context, the figure also represents an almost 70% improvement year-over-year.Of the 25,000 vehicles that were delivered, Tesla said roughly 13,450 units were Model S sedans - the company's highest-priced vehicle. Meanwhile, 11,500 vehicles were Model X SUVs.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has drawn criticism for several things, including the company's high cash burn, but perhaps most notable is TSLA's track record of missed delivery targets.But that narrative is beginning to change …Can You Actually Trust Tesla Stock?TSLAdiddisappoint investors with a delivery miss in the fourth quarter. However, the Palo Alto, California-based electric car maker has now topped its delivery forecast in two of the past three quarters.Better still, the company is on pace to deliver 50,000 cars in the first half of 2017, which would match the high end of Tesla's own estimates.Tesla also announced Sunday that during the quarter, not only did it produce 25,418 vehicles, but that about roughly 4,650 vehicles were on their way to their customers. Those will filter into Q2's deliveries number.The fact that first-quarter deliveries beat estimates, combined with higher potential deliveries in the first half of 2017 vindicates some of the decisions Musk has made. And all of it bodes well for Tesla stock in the short-term.China'sTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCHEY), which last week announced it bought a 5% stake Tesla for $1.78 billion, looks prescient now. And with Tesla gearing up to launch its Model 3 sedan in an effort to compete withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral MotorsCompany(NYSE:GM) in vehicle mass-market production, Tencent can help Tesla grab a stronger foothold in China, which is the largest automobile market in the world.Next PageThe Model 3, by the way, is yet another area in which it looks like Tesla can beat back its past issues of false starts, with the company saying earlier this year that it'son track to begin production on time.Bottom Line for Tesla StockTesla closed Friday at $278.30 - about 8% higher than whenI last recommended the stock. Better still, shares have soared some 55% from their Dec. 2 low.Click to EnlargeAll of this coincides with a pretty important technical event. Tesla stock is not only bouncing off its 50-day moving average and well off its longer-term 200-day moving average, but it has crashed a price ceiling at $280 that beat shares back in 2014, 2015 and earlier this year.In other words, technically speaking, the sky's the limit.With Tesla seemingly operating on all cylinders, there's now increased confidence that the company not only can deliver on Model 3 production estimates, but also boost demand for the Model S and Model X in the quarters ahead.This makes Tesla stock a no-doubt buy despite its recent gains.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The postTesla, Inc.

Is Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Worth the Risk Anymore?;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA buyout is almost always a good thing for investors. But sometimes, the best-laid plans go to scrap, and shareholders who thought they had a winning lotto ticket suddenly realize they misread one of the numbers. Just look at the case ofRite Aid Corporation(NYSE:RAD), which is going through a nauseating up-and-down amid a merger attempt withWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NASDAQ:WBA).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrAll the way back in October 2015, Rite Aid agreed to sell out to Walgreens, with the latter paying $9 per share of RAD stock. But as time has passed, expectations that a deal will go through have soured; Rite Aid stock, which roared when the merger seemed like a lock, is now off more than 40% through the first quarter of 2017.The issue, as it usually is, is federal regulators. The combination of Rite Aid and Walgreens would greatly consolidate the industry, pairing the Nos. 2 and 3 drugstore chains by revenues. That very well might mean higher prices for consumers.Another critical worry is the potential additional leverage they would have with the major pharmacy-benefits managers likeCVS Health Corp(NYSE:CVS) andExpress Scripts Holding Company(NASDAQ:ESRX). By boosting its scale, WBA would have far more power in negotiating terms.The 7 Biggest Land Mines in Your Portfolio Right NowSo with the deal on thin ice, and Walgreens actually demanding an answer from regulators within the next three months … is RAD stock still worth a speculation?Changing Up the DealUnfortunately for Rite Aid longs, the drugstore's business has been fairly lackluster amid the merger limbo. In the latest quarter, revenues dipped by 1.2% to $8.1 billion, while adjusted EBITDA plunged 27% to $274.1 million on a year-over-year basis.SaysInvestorPlace.com'sJames Brumley:""Although Rite Aid's gross margins are relatively healthy, the company is alarmingly disappointing when it comes to its net profits. The short explanation is, however, it doesn't run its operation as efficiently as its peers run theirs, and it's arguably not getting enough traction with its small-scale pharmacy benefits manager EnvisionRx … a business its peers and rivals enjoy much greater scale in.""The deterioration likely was a key reason for thechange in the terms of the merger(announced in late January). Consider that Rite Aid and WBA agreed to a price tag of only $6.50 to $7 per share, depending on the number of RAD stores that can be divested.What's Next for RAD Stock?There is definitely lots of skepticism that the Rite Aid deal will not get done. Shares currently trade at a discount of between 30% and 34% to the price range Walgreens has on the table.But the worries might be overblown.After all, WBA and RAD have worked for a prolonged period on this deal to meet the regulatory requirements. To this end, there appears to be a deal to sell 865 Rite Aid stores toFred's, Inc.(NASDAQ:FRED) - though that number could go up to 1,200 to alleviate antitrust issues.And the pro-Trump Administration is likely to have a positive impact on the Federal Trade Commission's decision on the merger.When it comes the M&A game, nothing is guaranteed. Deals can easily fall apart - which could mean a big hit for investors. In fact, a Deutsche Bank analyst recently put out a grim report on the deal noting that, if the merger fails, RAD stock could fall to $2.25.Try This Apple Inc. Trade Before the CorrectionI believe if the parties walk away, both stocks could suffer selling pressure, especially as Wall Street arbitrageurs unwind their positions. But I don't see it being nearly that severe. Rite Aid is already trading at low levels, and general investor sentiment is negative as it is. RAD stock trades at just 0.15 times sales, versus 0.77 for WBA and 0.45 for CVS.I for one think the Rite Aid deal will close, and given the current gap with the proposed buyout pricing, that could represent a compelling opportunity to snag 25%-plus returns over the next few months.In the meantime, we wait.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Tesla also said that about 4,650 vehicles were in transit to customers and would be counted as Q2 deliveries. Total production in the quarter was 25,418 vehicles, another quarterly record.This news comes just days after Chinese tech giant Tencent HoldingsTCEHYrevealed a new 5% stake in Tesla, a move which should help the Palo Alto, California-based firm raise the cash it needs to bring its new Model 3 to full production (also read:Tesla Stock Jumps After Tencent Buys 5% Stake).Although Tencent will be a passive investor, some expect that Elon Musk will seek advice from the company on how to expand in China. Tesla has made headway in the country recently, with Chinese imports of Tesla vehicles in 2016 coming in five times higher than the year before.With countless growth opportunities in key markets and the rollout of the more affordable Model 3 on the horizon, Tesla investors should probably expect even more record-breaking quarters in the near future.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Stock Market News for April 03, 2017;4/3/2017;"Benchmarks finished in the red on Friday, dragged down primarily by financials as investors remained focus on the upcoming corporate earnings reports to justify the market's lofty valuations.  Meanwhile, U.S.oil pricesfinished slightly higheron Friday in spite of record increase in oil production, which eventually placed pressure on energy stocks.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.3% to close at 20,663.22. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,362.72. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index, meantime, closed at 5,911.74, declining 2.61 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) gained 7.2% to settle at 12.37. A total of around 6.4 billion shares were traded on Friday lower than the last 20-session average of 6.8 billion shares. Advancers outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 57% stocks that advanced, 39% declined.Financials Dragged the BenchmarksThe failure to pass the healthcare bill through the House of Representatives has raised questions about the Trump administration's ability to implement his pro-growth agenda, including tax cuts. This change in investor expectations negatively impacted bank stocks which eventually had a negative effect on financial stocks.In March, Fed raised key interest rates for the first time this year and intends to increase rates two times further. Investors were anticipating at least three more rate hikes but this relatively conservative stance on rate hike outlook by the central bank adversely impacted investor sentiment which had a negative impact on financial stocks.Some of the key holdings of the financial sector in S&P 500 including JPMorgan ChaseJPMand Wells Fargo & CoWFCdeclined by 1.3% and 1.0% respectively.

WTI crude prices rose by 0.5% to $50.60 a barrel.Increase in U.S. oil production raised concerns among investors about the persistent crude oversupply in the global market. This record increase in crude inventories had an adverse impact on energy shares which emerged as one of the worst performing sectors in the S&P 500.The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) decreased 0.3%. Some of its key holdings, including Exxon Mobil CorpXOMand Chevron CorporationCVXdropped 2.0% and 0.4%, respectively.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Dow and S&P 500 declined by 0.7% and 0.8% respectively.  In contrast, the Nasdaq posted a 1.5% increased. The first-quarter rally slowed down this month, after Trump's presidency took a hit following the failure to secure adequate votes to pass a Republican-led Healthcare bill through the House of Representatives. A relatively conservative stance on rate hike outlook from the central bank also kept financials in check.Quarterly ReviewFor the quarter, the Dow and Nasdaq gained 4.5% and 9.8%, respectively. The S&P 500 recorded a gain of 5.5%, its strongest first-quarter performance since 2013. Benchmarks ended in the green for the quarter, backed by a Trump-led rally.

Trade Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Before Its Major Rally;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill known for its ubiquitous Windows desktop software,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) broke ground in 2016 as the leader in cloud services. Microsoft's Azure cloud services topped $14 billion in revenue last year, compared to $12.2 billion forAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud services.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs a result, Microsoft stock rallied more than 17% in 2016, but this year could be even bigger as the software giant takes aim at artificial intelligence.The AI move is major for Microsoft, as it is for the company's partner:Adobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE). And the breakout for MSFT stock could start soon.The duo recently announced theintegration of Adobe Campaign and Microsoft Dynamics 365, with the result allowing users to assemble data and make business decisions in a way that wasn't previously possible with each separate platform.What's more, you can expect business-centric AI to take off rapidly in 2017, as bothsalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM) and Amazon have partnered up to integrate Salesforce'sbusiness AI Einstein with Amazon Connect.Click to EnlargeWith competition heating up on the business AI front, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street takes notice, and Microsoft stock is positioned to run.Technically, the shares have recovered nicely after retreating from their late-January highs.MSFT has since rallied higher along support at its rising 50-day moving average, and Microsoft stock is once again poised to test resistance at $66. A breakout here could mark the start of MSFT's next upleg in its longer-term rally that began in early 2016.Sentiment is certainly supportive when it comes to MSFT. According to data from Thomson/First Call, 24 of the 34 brokerage firms following Microsoft stock rate it a ""buy"" or better, leaving room for potential upgrades as the business AI sector gains steam.3 Soaring Semiconductor Stocks Still Worth BuyingWhat's more, there is also room for price-target increases for Microsoft stock.

Currently, the April put/call open interest ratio for MSFT rests at 0.70, down considerably from readings above 1.0 in early March. Furthermore, MSFT is already trading north of peak April call OI of 59,000 contracts at $65, and interest is building at $67.50 as options traders react to the possibility of a MSFT breakout above $66.Meanwhile, April implieds are currently well below historicals for Microsoft stock, and are pricing in a potential move of only about 1.7% for MSFT ahead of April expiration. In other words, Microsoft options are cheap right now. Currently, the upper bound lies near $66.88, while the lower bound lies at about $64.62.2 Trades for Microsoft StockCall Spread:Traders looking to get in on a breakout above $66 might want to consider an April $66/$67 bull call spread.

At last check, the $64 put was bid at 16 cents, or $16 per contract.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is More Risk Than Reward NowAs long as MSFT stock trades above $64 through April expiration, traders pursuing this strategy will keep the $16 premium.

Why United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock Isn’t Better Than Copa;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL), like most airlines in recent years, has delivered handsome returns for shareholders. Up 26.9% on an annualized basis over the last five years through Mar. 23, the bull market for UAL stock and other airline stocks is beginning to look a little tired.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockInvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn recently called United Airlines stock theworst airline stockyou can buy, pointing readers to better-operated airlines likeAlaska Air Group, Inc.(NYSE:ALK) orSouthwest Airlines Co(NYSE:LUV).He has a point.The Downside to United AirlinesWhy buy UAL stock when you can own an airline like Southwest that has less debt and better margins? Conservative investors are wise to take up his recommendation. However, those who like a little spice with their airline investing might want to consider United Airlines' Latin American partner -Copa Holdings, S.A.(NYSE:CPA).Copa is based in Panama City, Panama, perfectly situated between North and South America. Efficiently run, the currency/economic issues facing Latin America over the last couple of years really took the steam out of its stock, a fact I'm painfully aware of.10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowIn December 2013, I wrote an article entitled,The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next 20 Years.Unfortunately, I recommended CPA stock near its all-time high of $162.83, whereupon it proceeded to spiral downward to as low as $41 in September 2015. It has since recovered a chunk of those losses, but still has a negative annual total return of 10.2%. I expect those returns to turn positive on annual basis by 2018.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next 20 Years - Dec. 12/2013 to Mar. 23/2017CompanyAnnualized Total ReturnEcho Global Logistics, Inc.(NASDAQ:ECHO) 0.80%Universal Display Corporation(NASDAQ:OLED) 34.9% Copa Holdings -10.2%SVB Financial Group(NASDAQ:SIVB)19.5%Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)27.9% Overall 17.3%SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY)8.8%Why Do I Like Copa and Not UAL Stock?There's not one thing I can put my finger on that screams buy one over the other. However, Latin America is expected to see GDP growth in 2017 of1.5%, its best showing since 2013. Panama is the fastest-growing economy in Latin America; projected GDP growth in 2017 is 6.4%, a continuation of a multi-year economic boom in its home country.It has71737-Max's on order with the first to arrive in 2018. Its fleet is already young with an average age of seven years and heading lower on the delivery of the new planes.That will help lower fuel costs and increase margins. Copa management estimate cost reduction initiatives like this will add 100 basis points to its EBIT margin in 2017; other strategies including the recovery of the Latin American economies should add another 10 percentage points to its EBIT margins by 2019.Earnings drive share prices higher.In the first two months of the year, Copa has seen traffic improve with a3.5%increase in available seat miles (ASM), an 8.9% increase in revenue seat miles (RSM) and load factor is up on a year-to-date basis by 410 basis points to 82.4%. If Copa were a hotel (load factor is basically the same thing as occupancy) the owners would be very happy.Copa expects its 2017 ASM to grow by 6%, 450 basis points higher than its growth this past year. Equally important it expects to improve operating margins by as much as 460 basis points to 17%. Load factor is projected to be 80%; its adjusted breakeven load factor in 2016 was 70.7%.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a No-Doubt Buy After Deliveries Beat""Copa Holdings fourth quarter results reflect the continuous improvement in the demand environment,"" Copa management commented in its Q3 2016 earnings release. ""Additionally, good commercial execution and capacity discipline have allowed the company to make the most of improving traffic trends and to deliver historically high load factors.""Bottom Line on UAL StockWhile airlines like UAL stock in the U.S. are experiencing slowertrafficso far in 2017, Copa is full speed ahead and it's only going to get better inQ2 2018when the south terminal expansion in Panama City opens for business.The biggest risk with owning Copa stock is the fact it operates in a politically unstable region of the world bringing an element of the unknown to your investment.However, its management team would not be out of place in Chicago where United Airlines is based or Atlanta or any of the other cities where U.S. airlines are headquartered. Its CEO, Pedro Heilbron, has been in the top job since1988; he understands the issues that Latin American businesses face every day. Several of its senior people have worked with U.S. airlines including United Airlines.For me, it's not so much I feel UAL stock is a bad stock, but rather that Copa is a better one.That said, the risk might be too much for the average retail investor; I get that. But if you're at all familiar with Latin America, I think you ought to at least consider it.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q17 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right NowThe postWhy United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock Isn't Better Than Copaappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla, Inc. Posts Record Vehicle Deliveries -- What Investors Should Know;4/3/2017;"With electric-car makerTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) higher-volume, lower-cost Model 3 on the   horizon, investors likely expect the company to show that it can   at least meet its smaller, near-term targets for its Model S and   Model X deliveries. With Tesla's delivery figures for the quarter   just released, Tesla looks like it is on track.For its first quarter of 2017, Tesla said this weekend that it   delivered just over 25,000 vehicles during the quarter, up 69%   year over year compared to its deliveries in the year-ago   quarter.Model S (left) and Model X (right). Image source:     author.makeArticleAd();Living up to guidanceWith 25,000 vehicle deliveries in Tesla's first quarter, the   company is well positioned to meet its guidance, which management   opted to provide for the first half of the year instead of the   first quarter specifically. In the company's fourth-quarter   update, management said it expected to deliver 47,000 to 50,000   Model S and Model X units during the first half of 2017 -- a   range that is up 61% to 71% from vehicles in the first half of   2016. After delivering 25,000 vehicles in Q1, Tesla only needs to   deliver between 22,000 units in its second quarter to hit its   guidance for the first half of the year.Of these deliveries, Tesla said about 13,450 units were Model   S and 11,550 were Model X. While both figures were up year over   year and sequentially, Tesla's 11,550 Model X deliveries were a   bright spot, highlighting the company's ongoing rapid ramp-up of   production and deliveries of the late-2015 introduced   all-electric SUV. Tesla's record quarterly Model X deliveries   were up 381% year over year and 21% sequentially.DeliveriesQ1 2017Q1 2016ChangeModel S13,45012,4208%Model X11,5502,400381%Data sources: Tesla's quarterly SEC filings and quarterly   vehicle delivery updates. Table by author.Tesla also notably said it produced 25,418 vehicles during the   quarter, also a record for Tesla.Going into its second quarter, Tesla ended Q1 with about 4,650   vehicles in transit to customers for a second-quarter delivery.   This figure was down from the approximately 6,450 vehicles Tesla   had in transit to customers at the end of its fourth quarter.Viewed from a different angleWhile Tesla's year-over-year growth for vehicle deliveries   during its first quarter is impressive, growth doesn't look as   hot when viewed over the last three quarters.Data sources: Tesla's quarterly SEC filings and quarterly     vehicle delivery updates. Chart by author.After hitting 24,821 deliveries in the third quarter of 2016,   Tesla's total Model S and Model X deliveries seem to have leveled   off. Of course, this is an impressive level of deliveries for   Tesla to sustain; Model S is already outselling comparably priced   large luxury sedans in North America and some other key markets,   and Model X is among top sellers in its category. But with   deliveries seeming to level off, growth may not be coming as easy   for Tesla -- at least not until the company introduces a   lower-priced electric vehicle. This isn't particularly   surprising, since Model S and Model X have steep starting prices   of $68,000 and $73,000, respectively. The market for vehicles at   this price point is limited.With a starting price of $35,000, Tesla's Model 3 is expected   to be the company's next key growth driver. The vehicle is slated   to begin production in July. Management expects Model 3 will help   Tesla's vehicle production increase from a rate of about 100,000   units per year today to around 500,000 units next year.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Is Being Underestimated by Investors;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven afterBlackBerry Ltd's(NASDAQ:BBRY)results beat expectationson Friday morning, most investors and pundits still seem to belost in the treesof the company's financial results and near-term outlook, while ignoring the forest of the company's tremendous, longer term opportunities.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrSpecifically, BlackBerry has made huge strides in several tech markets that are either rapidly growing, or huge, or both. Among these are connected autos, the cloud and IT security.Moreover, a number of the company's products in these areas have been validated by huge enterprises, and its CEO previously successfully turned around a company that was on the brink of failure. Going forward, BBRY should be able to more fully exploit the rapid growth of the markets it has entered and the strength of its products, enabling its software revenue to rapidly accelerate.Consequently, investors should buy BBRY stock, which currently has a compelling valuation.Tech Growth Catalysts for BBRY StockBlackBerry's QNX operating system for connected carshas a market share of about 47%, asFord Motor Company(NYSE:F),General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) , andAudiall utilize it.Ford recently further validatedthe strength of BBRY's connected car technologies by agreeing to hire 400 BlackBerry workers to further develop wireless systems.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementAccording to BI Intelligence, ""the connected-car market is growing at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 45%,"" and 75% of all cars shipped in 2020 ""will be built with internet-connection hardware.""As BlackBerry CEO John Chen indicated, BBRY can make much more money by building new apps for cars and charging fees for them. He also plans to provide components of self-driving vehicles. If and when self-driving cars take off, Blackberry is going to make a great deal of money from in-car apps and the components it's developing, providing a crucial growth catalyst for BlackBerry stock.Cybersecurity is a huge market, as it's expectedto jump to $202 billion in 2021from $122.5 billion in 2016, according to research firm MarketsAndMarkets. The U.S. government recently validated BlackBerry'ssecurity solutionsby granting the company FedRAMP and Authority to Operate certificates.Additionally, Chen reported on March 31 that, ""Giuliani Partners selected BlackBerry Secure as the underlying software platform to support its consulting practice for government enterprise customers."" Not only is the CEO of Giuliani Partners, Rudy Giuliani, a confidante of President Donald Trump, buthe is going to advise the administration on cybersecurity.It seems like BBRY stock has gained an inside track on cybersecurity deals with the U.S. government. Furthermore, according to Chen, the U.S. certifications will enable the company to sell security to ""a lot of (other) governments."" Finally, BlackBerry's security business seems to be gaining traction outside of governments, as it won security deals with several large companies last quarter, includingDeutsche Post DHL,Nationwide Mutual InsuranceandMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.According toGlobal Market Insights, enterprise mobility management, another major area of focus for BlackBerry, was worth over $3 billion in 2014 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 30% from 2016-2023.Last quarter, BlackBerry, in partnership withChina Mobile Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:CHL) won a10,000 seat EMM pilotwithChina Co-Op Group, as well as an EMM deal withVodafone Group Plc (ADR)'s(NASDAQ:VOD) German unit. To the extent that BBRY's EMM business can deepen its penetration of large geographic markets like China and Germany, the company's financial results and BBRY stock will rise significantly.Finally, BlackBerry recently entered the fast-growing Platform-as-a-Service, or PaaS, computing market, which Gartner expects to be worth$14.798 billion in 2020, up from $7.17 billion in 2016. Specifically, BBRYlaunched BBM Enterprise SDKfor the communications platform-as-a-service market.The product, which the company saysenables developers""to securely build enterprise-grade messaging, voice, and video functionality into their applications,"" puts it ""in a solid position to benefit from the growing demand for embedded communications services,"" BlackBerry quotes Raul Castanon-Martinez, an analyst at 451 Research as saying.More importantly and concretely, 15 independent software vendors, have already agreed to use the system, which became available in early February Chen reported on March 31.BlackBerry's Rock Star CEOThis is not the first time that Chen has taken the helm of a company that was on the verge of failure.In 1998, he took over enterprise service providerSybasewhich one research firm said had a 70% chance of failing. When Chen became CEO, Sybase was reportedly worth $362 million, and it was sold for $5.8 billion in 2010.Under Chen's leadership, Sybase moved ""into profitable markets,"" and observers questioned the viability of the strategy. Sound familiar?BBRY ValuationEven after Friday's rally, BlackBerry stock is trading at less than three times the company's sales.Conversely,Mobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY), whose products enable autonomous driving, wasrecently acquiredbyIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) for 31 times its estimated revenue, according toForbes. Even if BlackBerry is only valued based on its high-margin, high-growth software and services revenue, and no value is given to its other assets and businesses, the Mobileye deal suggests that BBRY stock is vastly undervalued at current levels.Specifically, if the $193 million in software and services revenue that BlackBerry generated last quarter is multiplied by four and then increased by 14% (the midpoint of the company's 13%-15% growth guidance for fiscal 2018), the result is $880 million. At the 31 times multiple awarded to Mobileye, that would equate to a market valuation for BlackBerry stock of $27.28 billion, versus BlackBerry's current total valuation of $4.5 billion.Why Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) Stock Is RiskyAnd IT security companyPalo AltoNetworks Inc(NYSE:PANW) is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 6.7. At that multiple, the enterprise value of BlackBerry, again just based on its software and services revenue, would be $5.83 billion, almost 30% above the current level of BBRY stock.Based on Blackberry's growth opportunities, the track record of its CEO, and the valuation of the company, it's definitely a great idea to buy BBRY stock at current levels.As of this writing, Larry Ramer owned shares of BBRY stock.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best ETFs to Buy for the Rest of 20177 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a No-Doubt Buy After Deliveries BeatThe postBlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Is Being Underestimated by Investorsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla (TSLA) Reports Record Deliveries in the First Quarter;4/3/2017;"Tesla, Inc.TSLAhas reported record quarterly deliveries for the first quarter of 2017, up about 69% year over year. Over 25,000 vehicles were delivered in the quarter, comprising of roughly 13,450 units of Model S and 11,550 vehicles of Model X. The actual number could vary by 0.5% as the company only counts vehicles as delivered which have been transferred to customers and paperwork has been correctly completed.Tesla also reported record quarterly vehicle productions of 25,418 units in the quarter, up 14.2% from the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition to the deliveries recorded, about 4,650 vehicles are in transit that will be recorded as deliveries in the second quarter of 2017.

Tencent vs. Baidu: Who Will Win the Upcoming Chinese AI War?;4/3/2017;"Tech giantsTencent(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) andBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) are currently engaged in an ongoing O2O   (online-to-offline) ecosystem war in China. Tencent is turning   WeChat -- the most popular messaging app in China -- into an   all-in-one platform for making payments, hailing cabs, playing   games, ordering food, and making online purchases. That   social-centric expansion forced Baidu, which owns the biggest   search engine in China, to add similar services to its mobile   app.Those battles are now moving toward the growing artificial   intelligence market. By adding AI capabilities to their   platforms, Tencent and Baidu can boost the analytics capabilities   of their services and set the foundations for next-gen   initiatives like driverless cars. Let's take a closer look at the   arms race between these two companies, and see if one can   eventually gain the upper hand.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();A look at Tencent's AI investmentsTencent first announced the establishment of its  AI Lab   last April, and 50 AI specialists now work there. Tencent   recently poached the chief of machine learning research at   Baidu's Big Data Lab, Tong Zhang, to lead the unit. Prior to   joining Baidu, Zhang cut his teeth atIBMandYahoo. Zhang will also lead a team of 200 product engineers to convert   AI advances into usable features for Tencent's apps and   services.Tencent wants to apply AI to four key areas -- its content,   social apps, online games, and cloud services. The company notes   that ""over a hundred"" of its products -- including WeChat, QQ,   and the Tian Tian Kuai Bao news app -- already rely on AI. To   strengthen its cloud-based AI processing capabilities, Tencent   installedNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) high-end GPUs -- which are  better for   machine learning purposes than CPUs -- in its cloud servers.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent also developed a Go-playing AI to followAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Google's AlphaGo AI beat   Go world champion Lee Sedol last year. Tencent's Go-playing AI,   Fine Art, recently beat high-ranking Japanese Go player Ryo   Ichiriki.AI scientists believe that Go, which requires players to   surround opponents' pieces with their own, is a better test of   problem solving than chess because it has many more possible   moves.Like Google, Tencent believes that AI, ride hailing apps, EVs,   and driverless cars will eventually converge. That's why it   recently invested inChinese EV makerNIOand bought  a 5% stake inTesla Motors. It might even tap its existing partnership with NVIDIA, which   develops CPUs for connected and driverless cars, to eventually   produce its own driverless platform.A look at Baidu's AI plansBaidu founded its  Big Data Lab in July 2014. The   division focuses on improving its machine learning algorithms,   core search technologies, and big data applications. Its products   include the Siri-like virtual assistant Duer, which was    recently given its own business unit, and predictive   analytics tools for businesses. Like Google, Baidu wants to   process the data it receives from its search, mapping, and cloud   services into useful information for companies and consumers.Baidu is aggressively expanding this unit with investments,   partnerships, government backing, and big hires. Like Tencent,   Baidu invested in NIO during its last funding round. It partnered   with NVIDIA and  HERE Maps to create a cloud-connected   mapping platform for autonomous cars, and plans to launch its own   autonomous cars -- which are being produced by a Chinese   automaker -- by  2018. It also formed the dedicated   Intelligent Driving division for those efforts earlier this   year.Image source: Getty Images.In late February, Baidu obtained approval from the Chinese   government to launch a state-backed engineering laboratory for    deep learning technologies like computer vision, machine   hearing, biometric identification, and human-computer   interactions. It also recently acquired Raven Tech, a   Beijing-based start-up which develops an AI platform for smart   homes.Baidu has hired many top AI researchers to lead these efforts,   but it recently lost two major leaders. In addition to Tong   Zhang's abrupt departure for Tencent, Baidu's chief    scientist Andrew Ng, a former Googler who led the AI group   since 2014, also resigned. Those departures have raised serious   concerns, since Baidu's AI group has grown to around 1,300 people   -- and those employees need experienced leaders.Which company has the upper hand?Tencent and Baidu's AI arms race will likely continue for   years, but I doubt that either company will completely   outmaneuver the other. That's because the battle between Tencent   and Baidu closely mirrors the ongoing clash betweenFacebookand Google -- one company owns the dominant social network,   while the other controls the dominant search engine.Since neither ecosystem will completely consume the other,   there will probably always be people who prefer using Tencent's   WeChat over Baidu's app as all all-in-one platform, and vice   versa. However, investors should keep an eye on how much money   Tencent and Baidu are spending on these AI and O2O efforts, since   both companies have posted rising expenses in recent   quarters.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Delivers 25,000 Vehicles in Q1, Tops Estimates;4/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) announced on Sunday that it delivered more than 25,000 vehicles during the first quarter, beating estimates and helping to prop up TSLA stock in premarket trading.makeArticleAd();That deliveries figure - a quarterly record for Tesla - is a roughly 70% improvement year-over-year, and easily cleared Wall Street's expectations for a range of 23,000 and 24,500 deliveries.TSLA also said it produced 25,418 vehicles during the quarter, another record, and that roughly 4,650 vehicles were still in transit at Q1's end.Tesla had not projected Q1 deliveries previously, but did say it expected to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 units in the first half of 2017.The company did get a bump thanks to delays in Q4. Back when it announced 2016 deliveries (76,230 vehicles, which were several thousand shy of estimates), Tesla said that 6,450 vehicles were in transit and would count toward first-quarter deliveries.The quarter's 25,000 deliveries were split between 13,450 Model S units and 11,500 Model X units.The 7 Biggest Land Mines in Your Portfolio Right NowThe announcement should push TSLA stock even higher in Monday's trading.

EV Smart Charging Takes a Big Step Forward;4/1/2017;"As the number of electric vehicles on the road grows, it   presents some interesting opportunities and challenges for   utilities as well as companies trying to build charging   infrastructure. A plug charging your vehicle seems simple enough,   but the increased demand on the grid could wreak havoc if   everyone plugs in when they get home from work every day, a time   of day that incidentally aligns with peak electricity demand.As time-of-use rates are implemented across the country, it   also might not make financial sense to be charging a vehicle at 6   p.m. if you don't need it until 7 a.m. the next day. Nighttime   rates may be lower, so for customers, a smart-charging solution   would be valuable if it easily integrates into their lifestyle.   This week,AeroVironment(NASDAQ: AVAV) took a step in that direction with a partnership   witheMotorWerks.Image source: Aerovironment.makeArticleAd();Smart charging for EVsThe agreement between AeroVironment and eMotorWerks will offer   customers the ability to get cloud-connected charging, which will   decide when it's most efficient to charge one or more vehicles.   And there's a green charging option for renewables, so customers   can drive without using fossil fuels.The main platform AeroVironment will use is called JuiceNet,   which decides when the EV will be charged based on how much   charge is needed and by when. So a customer will be able to set   the charger to have their EV ready to go for work in the morning   and all of the work of figuring out when to charge for greatest   efficiency will be done in the background.For eMotorWerks, Aerovironment is an access point to   potentially millions of EVs in the future. The company has   partnerships with eight global automakers, and as they introduce   new EVs in coming years, Aerovironment's charger network will   grow by leaps and bounds.Aggregating demand is the next innovation for     utilitiesWhat's exciting from the utility side is that JuiceNet can   integrate with the utility's resources and offer demand response.   When electricity usage, and therefore rates, are high, the   utility could tell JuiceNet to reduce EV charging, and vice   versa. This is demand response -- but Aerovironment and JuiceNet   would be offering the utility an aggregated demand of hundreds or   thousands of vehicles, which could have a significant impact on   the grid.Becoming an early mover in this space will be key for both   companies.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will let customers schedule charging, and with its   experience in energy storage, I think aggregation of EVs on its   network is only a matter of time. But if the Aerovironment   network is big enough, it could outpace Tesla's, creating a   valuable position in the market.How will the smart charging business play out?I think this kind of smart device aggregation is just the   beginning, and soon solar power, energy storage, EVs, and other   devices in the home will all be tied together and used more   efficiently. Today the smart home still consists of disparate   devices like thermostats, solar panels, batteries, and maybe a   few smart devices, but companies are starting to think about home   energy needs more holistically. A holistic solution that   maximizes value for consumers and offers easy operations has yet   to emerge. But it's on the horizon, and Aerovironment and   eMotorWerks just made a big play to be part of that smart energy   future.10 stocks we like better than AeroVironmentWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Boeing Co (BA) Stock Takes a Seat to Higher Profits;4/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe March 27announcementbyAdient PLC(NYSE:ADNT) that it was collaborating withBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) to create better, more functional aircraft seating for its airplanes had a positive effect on Boeing stock, sending it up $1.26 in next-day trading.makeArticleAd();Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrBut is it enough to keep Boeing stock moving higher?After all, Boeing is already up 14% through the end of March. If today were the last day of 2017, Boeing's annual total return for the year would be higher than its three previous years.Boeing stock continues to go higher despite revenue going lower; that's not something that can carry on for very long unless arrangements such as the one with Adient, the former car seat division ofJohnson Controls International Plc(NYSE:JCI), delivers substantial reductions in manufacturing costs.The Impact of the Agreement on Boeing StockWhile the financial benefits for Boeing are yet to be determined, it's very clear why Adient is interested in working with the airplane manufacturer.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementAccording to Counterpoint Market Research, the aircraft interiors market isprojectedto grow to $21.7 billion by 2025. Meanwhile, growth in U.S. auto sales isslowingto the lowest annual year-over-year increase since the 2008 financial crisis.""Through discussions with Boeing, we believe there's an opportunity for Adient to raise the bar on the aviation passenger experience, building on our leadership in the automobile seat market."" said Adient Chairman and CEO Bruce McDonald.When one door closes, another one opens. The vice president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kent Fisher, had this to say in the press release:""Boeing is building commercial airplanes at record rates to deliver on an order backlog of more than $400 billion. We continually explore opportunities to offer more value to our customers and believe they would benefit from a wider range of options and more reliable, on-time performance in the airplane interiors and seating category.""The problem for Boeing isn't the $400 billion backlog of orders it has on its plate or the desire to build better more functional seating - it's that most of the orders are for its 737 class of planes which come with a cheaper price tag and lower profitability.So while Boeing will deliver as many as 765 planes this year, more than it delivered in 2016, it will come at the expense of top-line revenue. In 2016, Boeing generated$94.6 billionin sales; it expects between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion in revenue in 2017, a year-over-year decline of up to 4.3%. That's on top of a 2% decline in 2016.In terms of non-GAAP core earnings, Boeing expects as much as $9.10 per share, significantly higher than the $7.25 per share it produced in 2016. Operating cash flow is expected to grow by $250 million to $10.75 billion with free cash flow increasing 7.2% to $8.5 billion.Clearly, Boeing expects to cut costs in 2017.""Looking forward, our team is intent on accelerating productivity and program execution to deliver increasing cash and profitability from our large and diverse order backlog,"" said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in its Q4 2016 earnings release.Furthermore, BoeingannouncedMarch 27 that it's raising the list price of every one of its planes in order to recover higher manufacturing costs including labor. By hook or by crook, Boeing is going to deliver on its profitability goals for 2017 and beyond.Will Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Defy Financial Gravity Forever?I think this partnership is a good move for both companies and while the benefits to Adient are more readily apparent, Boeing wouldn't be doing this if it didn't think it could help streamline the manufacturing process so that planes are built faster and better than they were before the arrangement.As Isaidat the end of February, I see the glass half-full when it comes to Boeing stock. This certainly cements those thoughts.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace4 Things Every Apple Inc.

These Popular Stocks Could Prove Toxic for Your Portfolio;3/31/2017;"Sometimes, stocks that seem like great investments can go bad.   Companies with good numbers or a strong story can have flaws that   aren't readily visible to most investors. Even good   companies can hit roadblocks, or situations where there's a lot   more at risk than is apparent.We asked three of our Fool contributors to name companies that   are popular with investors but stand a chance of turning toxic.   Here's why they're concerned aboutTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) , andTeva Pharmaceutical Industries(NYSE: TEVA).Make-or-break moment for a market favoriteJohn Rosevear(Tesla):Few companies have generated the excitement among investors that   Tesla has over the last several years. There are good   reasons to be excited: CEO Elon Musk is a charismatic leader with   big ideas; Tesla's cars are a step ahead of the big automakers'   in several important ways; and the company's growth potential (in   cars, in solar panels, in batteries) seems nearly limitless.makeArticleAd();So why might Tesla prove ""toxic""? It's because the company is   at a genuine make-or-break moment. There's a real risk that   things could go awry over the next year, and I don't think   investors have properly recognized that risk.Tesla's valuation rests in large part on the assumption that   it will become a mass-market automaker, selling hundreds of   thousands or even millions of vehicles year after year.  To   get there, its upcoming Model 3 has to be great -- and here's the   thing: It has to begreat in some ways that Tesla's current vehicles   aren't.Tesla's Model 3 has to be Toyota-good -- or mass-market     buyers will pass. Image source: Tesla.That's where the risk lies. There's a lot to like about   Tesla's current products, the Model S and Model X. But as even   most Tesla fans will acknowledge, the truth is that both have   weaknesses in their designs that show Tesla's inexperience as an   automaker. That hasn't been a problem for Tesla so far: Its early   adopter fans have been mostly very willing to forgive things like   iffy seats, crooked panel gaps, and dodgy door handles in order   to be first with Tesla's genuinely impressive whiz-bang   technology.But this is the moment where Tesla has to gobeyondthe early adopters and establish that it can sell vehicles to   hundreds of thousands (eventually, millions) of buyers every   year. Mass-market car buyers might love Tesla's tech, but if the   Model 3's fit and finish, comfort, and reliability isn't up toToyotaorBMWstandards, then the tech might not be enough. That will be   especially true once the big automakers start to launch credible   electric rivals to the Model 3, as they will -- soon.So here's why Tesla could turn toxic: There's a real risk that   the Model 3 will fall short of the quality and   finish expectations that mass-market car buyers have come to   expect. If it does, then Tesla will have a lot of trouble   sustaining the pace of sales its investors expect, and its stock   price will suffer accordingly.Big bets and tough competitionReuben Gregg Brewer(Verizon Communications Inc.):Verizon Communicationsis one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United   States. It sports a fat 4.7% yield backed by 10 years of dividend   increases. You'd think Verizon would be an easy stock to love as   the world goes increasingly mobile. But I have a couple of   concerns.My first is Verizon's push into content. The goal appears to   be expanding its reach from simply supplying the cellular   connection that allows content consumption to also controlling at   least some of the content that's consumed. However, Verizon is   going about it by acquiring internet companies, like AOL, that   have struggled after finding early success. Buying second-rate   assets in the hope of a business resurrection isn't a great plan   in my book. It's going to take a lot of cash to turn these   businesses around, or -- my bigger fear -- the effort will be a   complete waste of time and shareholders' money.My other concern is the resurgence of unlimited data plans,   increasingly at very low prices. In fact, my wife and I just   switched from metered plans at Verizon andAT&T, respectively, to a competitor offering unlimited data for the   same or better prices. Verizon and AT&T have no choice but to   compete with smaller, more aggressive cellphone companies because   there's little product differentiation today. In my mind, this   industry dynamic puts Verizon at the mercy of its most desperate   competitors at a time when it's making risky investments that may   not pan out. That's a recipe for disaster in my book.Too many problemsKeith Speights(Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.):At first glance, you might think that Teva is a great drug stock   to add to your portfolio. The company experienced a solid boost   to revenue last year. Teva stock appears to be priced   inexpensively, with shares trading at less than seven times   estimated earnings. And we can't forget Teva's dividend, which   currently yields over 4%.The true picture for Teva isn't nearly as good as those facts   indicate, however. While the company did make higher revenue in   2016, its earnings sank. That low stock valuation reflects   expectations that Teva's earnings challenges won't be fixed   anytime soon. As for the dividend, the drugmaker returned a much   higher amount of money to shareholders through dividend payments   than it made in profits.Teva's biggest challenge right now is that its key patents for   Copaxone 40 mg/mL have been invalidated by a U.S. District Court.   The multiple sclerosis drug is Teva's top seller, contributing   more than 19% of total revenue.On top of all this, Teva is searching for a new CEO. Former   CEO Erez Vigodman left the company in February. His   resignation followed the departure of Sigurdur Olafsson two   months earlier. Olafsson had led Teva's generic-drug   business.Don't be tempted by the cheap valuation and high dividend   yield. Teva might eventually get its house in order, but for now   the best course of action is to stay away.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Innovation ETF (ARKK) Hits New 52-Week High;3/31/2017;"For investors looking for momentum, Ark Innovation ETFARKKis probably on your radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high of $23.94. Shares of ARKK are up roughly 30.54% from their 52-week low price of $17.93/share.But could more gains be ahead for this ETF? Let's take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook to get a better idea on where it might be headed:makeArticleAd();ARKK in FocusARKK is an actively managed fund, providing significant exposure to domestic technology and health care companies among others. It has key holdings in the Health Care, Information Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors, with almost 90% allocation to them. The fund charges 75 basis points in fees. It has around 52% allocated to its top 10 holdings and the top three holdings are Athenahealth IncATHN, Tesla Motors IncTSLA, and Illumina IncILMN(see :all the Alternative Energy ETFs here).The fund has AUM of $17.7 million and trades in an average volume of 5,100 shares.Why the Move?The recent blow to President Trump's healthcare bill led to a rally in the sector. This was a positive for this fund, given its high exposure to the space. From an individual holdings perspective, Tesla Inc. has 9% allocation while 4.7% is allocated to AmazonAMZN.  Recently, China's Tencent Holdings acquired a 5% stake in Tesla, which led to a surge in the stock (read:Tencent Buys 5% Stake in Tesla: ETFs in Focus).Furthermore, Amazon is set to expand into the Middle East, with its recent deal to acquire Souq.com. Both these deals impacted the ETF (read:Amazon Inks Deal to Acquire Souq.com: 2 ETFs in Focus).More Gains Ahead?There is still uncertainty regarding President Trump's policy implementation. So it is hard to get a handle on the fund's future returns one way or another. However, the ETF has aweighted alpha of 27.5and a moderate 14-day standard deviation of 14.9%. So there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Will Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Defy Financial Gravity Forever?;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe decision byTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) to buy 5% ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) for $1.7 billion seems to have caught out the company's short sellers.makeArticleAd();TSLA stock is up more than 30% so far in 2017, despite the company'sposting a loss for the December quarteron sales that fell short of the mark set in September of $2.3 billion. The balance sheet shows debt skyrocketing, cash flow is coming entirely from financing, so the most logical thing for a trader to do seemed to be to short the stock.Short interest peaked in December, but it has remained high. About 19% of the common was short on March 15. The Tencent investmentwas announced on March 28.Goldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) underwrote the Tencent investment, even though their analyst had a sell on Tesla stock with a price targetbelow $200 per share.TSLA opened the last day of the quarter at around $278.Musk Still Has EnemiesAt its present price, Tesla has a market cap nearly equal to that ofFord Motor Company(NYSE:F), which sold 176,712 cars in January. Tesla, meanwhile, delivered 76,230 vehicles during all of 2016. Tesla's goal for 2017 is toproduce 500,000 vehiclesat its Fremont, California, production plant, which would make that factory the most productive in the world.10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowBob Lutz, who at 85 has held top jobs at all of America's ""big three"" automakers, is among those who is not amused.""They lose money on every car, they have a constant cash drain, and yet everyone talks as if this is the most miraculous automobile company of all time,"" he toldTheLos Angeles Timesrecently.Yet Musk is still able to get smart companies like Tencent to advance cash, based on promises, likesolar roofs that cost no more than regular roofs- promises he has yet to fulfill.Tesla's Problem Is ScaleLike others here atInvestorPlace, I cover Tesla regularly. I find the fundamentals to be completely out of whack with the valuation. And I recommended selling the stock in January when it was trading at $254, notingit was at the top of its trading range.Within a month, TSLA stock was at $280 per share and is now trading within a few dollars of that figure. So what do I know, right?James Brumley may be correct- that the Tencent underwriting is a huge buy signal. Even before ink was dry on that deal, Musk himself was off founding yet-another new company,Neuralink, which will work on man-computer interfaces.More big dreams.While most other technology executives were nonplussed by Donald Trump, Musk rushed to his side, causing one news site to label him a ""crony capitalist."" He has even deleted tweets critical of the administration.But one thing he has not been able to do, in all his rushing around among Tesla, Neuralink,SpaceXandSolarCity(which Tesla bought last year) is scale. Musk dreams big, Musk plans big … but Musk delivers small. When someone points out the distance between his promises and delivery, he simply dreams another dream, or spins his reality distortion field around another investor, relentlessly charming a disbelieving world.Trade of the Day: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)All the while, TSLA stock soars.Bottom Line on TSLA StockThis is what capitalism is supposed to be about: big egos with big dreams creating big change. But at some point, that change must happen at scale. At some point, promises must be fulfilled or the dreamer gets written off as a con artist.Maybe in the age of Trump, those rules no longer apply. Maybe in the age of Musk, there is no longer such a thing as financial gravity. But that still is not the way to bet.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Can The U.S. Come From Behind In The Robot Race?;3/30/2017;"OK, we get it: The robots are coming.From drone warfare to self-checkout lines at the grocery   store, the change is clear.Sales of automated industrial ""robots"" rose 15% year-over-year   in 2015, to reach an annual record of 253,748 units, according to   theInternational   Federation of Robotics. Those units were valued at $11 billion, 9% more than the year   before.makeArticleAd();That lifted the total installed base, worldwide, to 1.6   million industrial bots, a number that the IFR projects will   reach 2.6 million in 2019. For investors, it smells like   opportunity. But investment angles are opening only gradually   into an industry dominated by private and overseas players.From a jobs standpoint, when discussing all the robots in all   the factories around the world, 2.6 million units doesn't sound   particularly intimidating. And in a recent interview with Axios   Media, newly appointed U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin   said he was not worried about the impact of robotics, automation   and artificial intelligence on the factory floor and the   potential for mass displacement of U.S. jobs.""It's not even on our radar screen,"" he said, saying ""I'm not   worried at all"" about robots and artificial intelligence   displacing humans over the next 50 years or more. ""In fact, I'm   optimistic.""That point of view gets support from the IFR, which contends   that automation and robotics actuallycreate new jobs.But the case is being made more and more often that robots area job destroyer. A report released Wednesday from PricewaterhouseCooper   estimated a mind-numbing 38% of U.S. jobs could be at high risk   of automation by the early 2030s.The numbers of jobs at risk was highest - a full 56%   - in the transportation and storage industries, vs. 46% in   manufacturing and 44% in wholesale and retail. Risk dipped to 17%   for the health care and social work professions.And while it seems like a no-brainer that robots replace human   jobs, it's not that simple: The jury is still out on the impact   that robotics and automation have on employment.In practice, the PWC report says, not all of the jobs at risk   may actually be automated due to combined economic, legal and   regulatory factors.""It's really hard to know,"" said Travis Briggs, CEO and   partner atRobo   Global, creator of and exchange traded fund, the Global Robotics and   Automation Index Fund (ROBO).""I'm optimistic, taking the historical view of what technology   has done for job creation, and that it will create more   opportunity for qualified workers,"" Briggs said.Since 2010, the IFR says, demand for industrial robots has   accelerated considerably thanks to technology improvements and   the need for more automation.Unfortunately for the U.S., while America is a big user of   robotics it's well behind in the field of robots for industrial   manufacturing and stands to lose out on the billions of dollars   in purchases of robotics in the years ahead.Japan'sFanucCorp. is the world's largest industrial-robot producer.   Germany-based Kuka is another major player. Last year, China's   appliance giant Midea Group snapped up a majority stake in   Kuka.The U.S. remains a strong play in other types of robotics, and   in related technologies such as artificial intelligence, sensors,   drones, 3D printers and self-driving cars.Northrop Grumman(NOC) is a dominant manufacturer of pilotless drones and robotic   vehicles for industrial needs.GoPro(GPRO) has become a leading developer of commercial drones.AeroVironment(AVAV) is thinly-traded, but gives a piece of both commercial and   military drones.The U.S. is also heavily vested in technology used in   self-driving cars, whereTesla(TSLA) is an early innovator. Driver assist technology leaderMobileye(MBLY) is based in Israel, but trading on U.S. markets.Nvidia(NVDA) is fast seizing portions of the Automated Driver Assist   Systems market. And companies likeGarmin(GRMN), which is now Swiss-owned, but founded and largely located   in the U.S., andTrimble(TRMB) play leading roles in global positioning, mapping and   control systems on which many automated navigation systems   rely.In medical fields,Intuitive Surgical's(ISRG) da Vinci system remains the clear leader in   robotic-assisted, minimally-invasive operations, used in more   than 3,660 hospitals worldwide. But the market is heating up, and   Google-parentAlphabet(GOOGL) aims to create ""the future of surgery"" through its joint venture withJohnson & Johnson(JNJ) called Verb Surgical.The U.S. has also staked out a lead in 3D printers, with3D Systems(DDD) andStratasys(SSYS) being pure plays focused on consumer printers.HP Inc.(HPQ) andGeneral Electric(GE) have pushed hard into the commercial 3D printing space,   aiming to own a piece of the factory floors of the future.Improving Productivity And QualityChina generally leads the world's buying of industrial   robotics, accounting for 27% of total purchases in 2015. The   U.S., Japan, South Korea and Germany are also heavy shoppers,   taking up about 75% of sales. Automakers are the biggest market   for robotics, followed by electronics, then metals.""We're experiencing an exponential growth curve,"" said Briggs.   ""Costs have continued to come down and the technology advancement   continues to improve.""The North American robotics market in 2016 broke records for   orders, according to the Robotic Industries Association. About   34,600 robots valued at approximately $1.9 billion were ordered   in North America, year-over-year, up 10% in units, led by the   automotive industry.Robotics Industries Association President Jeff Burnstein, in   recent statements about the industry, said robots continued to   ""penetrate industries such as life sciences, warehousing, and   semiconductor and electronics manufacturing.""He also said use of robots was rising in small- and   medium-size companies ""who see robotics as a key factor in   improving productivity and product quality in order to stay   globally competitive.""Winning The Robotics RaceBut, while the U.S. is a major buyer of robotics and   automation technology it's not well positioned to cash in on the   billions of dollars expected to be spent in the years ahead.In an open letter to President Trump in December, business   entrepreneur Mark Cuban said when it comes to being a big   producer of robotics, ""We are not even close right now,"" he   wrote.Of the $1 trillion President Trump has said he wants to spend   on infrastructure projects, Cuban said he would spend $100   million of that on the development of robotics.""I would invest it in the companies that do R&D, software   and design for robots and every other facet of the Robotics   Industry,"" he wrote. ""We have to win the robotics race. We are   not even close right now.""Frank Tobe, owner and publisher of The Robot Report, which   tracks the business of robotics, said governments in China,   Japan, Korea and the European Union are providing significant   credits and incentives to make or keep robot-making in their   country.""These are strategic investments of billions and billions of   dollars,"" said Tobe. China's in-country robot production rate is   growing exponentially. Yet thus far in America, U.S. investments   in robotics technology is woefully inadequate""The industrial robot industry was started in America but the   companies making those original robots were sold and moved off   shore, never to return except in the form of sales and service   offices and research and support centers,"" he said.Facing a widening skills gap, two years ago the RIA made acall for actionby manufacturers, educators and policymakers, to step up their   game and prepare American workers with the skills needed for   economists are calling theFourth Industrial Revolution.That led to the formation of theAdvanced   Robotics for Manufacturing Institute.Supported by $253 million in public and private funding, ARM is   bringing together leaders and expertise from academia, research,   industry, government and nonprofits in a collaborative effort to   help revitalize American manufacturing.Based in Pittsburgh, ARM is led by a newly established   national nonprofit called American Robotics, which was founded byCarnegie Mellon   University.There's also Amazon Robotics, the product ofAmazon's(AMZN) acquisition of Kiva Systems for $775 million five years   ago. Its robots are helping to automate distribution and   fulfillment centers.The U.S. also has a vibrant startup community in the robotics   field. They include Fetch Robotics, Locus Robotics, IAM Robotics   and Rethink Robotics.U.S. companies in the ROBO ETF include iRobot, chipmaker   Nvidia, vision systems developerCognex(CGNX), Northrop Grumman, 3D Systems, Mobileye, and chipmakersQualcomm(QCOM) andAmbarella(AMBA).RELATED:Trump May Bring Home Apple, But He Can't Lick     Robotics5 Companies That Could Cause The Robot     Apocalypse"

Tesla Model Y: New Information Coming Next Week?;3/30/2017;"Don't get too excited.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model Y, which will be a smaller and cheaper   version of the electric-car company's Model X SUV, is still a   ""few years"" out, according to a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk   last week.But there may be some new information about Model Y released   as early as next week, according toArs Technica: ""We asked Musk (via Twitter direct message) whether there   was any truth to recent rumors of the fourth model. The reply? An   enigmatic 'Next week.'""Model X. Tesla has said the Model Y will be a smaller and     cheaper version of its Model X SUV. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();What we know about Model YMusk's tweet last week about Model Y was arguably the most   concrete confirmation Tesla has provided in some time that the   company is, indeed, going to bring to market its Model Y   crossover. And Musk's reported tease to Ars Technica of more   information about the vehicle coming out next week puts even more   certainty around the vehicle's eventual arrival.But what exactly will the Model Y be? Little is known about   Tesla's Model Y. Tesla management has implied that the vehicle   will essentially be an extension of the Model 3 platform, similar   to the way the Model X was an extension of the Model S platform.   In other words, the Model Y will likely sport the same-sized   wheelbase as the Model 3. This would enable Tesla to use the same   batteries it has in its Model 3 for the Model Y.Musk has also said the Model Y would feature falcon wing doors   like the Model X, but Musk said this before the company ran into   significant production challenges with the Model X's complex   features, leading management to admit ""hubris in adding far too   much new technology to the Model X in version 1."" This complexity   meant Tesla had insufficient supplier capability validation and   didn't possess enough internal capability to manufacture parts   in-house when suppliers didn't deliver, Tesla said in April 2016   after missing its guidance for first-quarter deliveries.Why Model Y?With about 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for Model 3 on   its books despite little effort to create awareness about the   vehicle, some investors might wonder why Tesla would even be   focusing on Model Y at all right now. But it makes more sense   when the vehicle is put into the context of Tesla's breakneck   growth ambitions.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: Author.With the help of a planned Model 3 launch later this year,   Tesla is aiming to grow vehicle production from an annualized   rate of about 100,000 units today to 500,000 units in 2018. But   looking beyond 2018, Tesla wants to grow annual vehicle   production to about 1 million units by 2020.To get to this level, Tesla may need to launch the Model Y.   Indeed, based on comments from Musk during the company's   second-quarter earnings call, Tesla may be expecting Model Y to   help vehicle production to grow to 1 million units andbeyond: ""To be clear, the priority vehicle development after the Model 3   would be the Model Y, the compact SUV, because that's also a car   that we expect to see demand in the 500k to 1 million unit per   year level.""Keep an eye out for some new information on Tesla's Model Y   next week.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

It's an uneven bump - theTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK) is up just 0.15% as of late Thursday's action. But a few bigger-name tech stocks are putting together moves that are making their charts look increasingly attractive.10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowHere are four tech stocks that just received a jolt:Tech Stocks That Just Got a Jolt: Netflix (NFLX)Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) shares have been mired in a tight three-month trading range after surging back in January following solid results.The company reported good subscriber additions, posted 36% revenue growth and issued strong forward guidance. But investors paused for breath amid increasing capital expenditure needs as the costs of original programming increases.Interest is returning now as the company remains the leader in the fast-growing streaming video on demand industry and is still ramping up its international presence. And earlier this week, I highlightedhow aggressively traders bid up a dip in NFLX stock.The next big potential catalyst for NFLX stock isn't too far off - Netflix reports its next batch of earnings the evening of April 17. Analysts are looking for earnings of 37 cents per share on revenues of $2.6 billion.Tech Stocks That Just Got a Jolt: Western Digital (WDC)Western Digital Corp(NASDAQ:WDC) has been overlooked due to its lack of sex appeal compared to the likes ofNvidiaCorporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) andMicron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU).Those who have given WDC some attention, however, have been well-rewarded over the past year, and could be in for even more upside.Shares are breaking up and over resistance from their January high, ending a three-month pause in an epic 135%-plus rally out of its May 2016 low. Shares surged back in January after a solid earnings report revealed healthy demand for hard drives and confident forward guidance from management. The company continues to push hard in the NAND memory space after acquiring SanDisk in 2016.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementWestern Digital will next report results on April 27 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.12 per share on revenues of $4.56 billion.Tech Stocks That Just Got a Jolt: Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are lifting to challenge the February high near $285.A breakout herewould end a long three-year consolidation range bounded by the $285-$290 level.That's abigdeal, and in theory could lead to the kinds of momentum-fueled upside that investors have been salivating over since 2014 … only to be denied.Shares have been boosted this week by a $1.8 billion investment by China'sTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY), easing concerns about the company's ability to raise the capital needed to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan this year. The investment represents a 5% stake in Elon Musk's electric vehicle (and now solar solutions) company.Tesla's next earnings report will be on May 3, after the closing bell. Analysts are looking for a loss of 75 cents per share on revenues of $2.56 billion.Tech Stocks That Just Got a Jolt: Amazon (AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are breaking out here, pushing up and over double-top resistance near $860 that has kept the tech giant constrained since October. All other resistance has been obliterated, too - major moving averages and price alike.Technically speaking, the sky's the limit, and that has pundits wonderingwhether AMZN stock can hit $1,000.The company also enjoyed an upgrade from analysts at Stifel on March 28. Stifel is bullish about the tailwinds from the industry chaos its Prime service has created, and as a result, it raised the price target on AMZN to $1,025 - that represents another 17% of upside from current prices.9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a ShareAmazon's next earnings report comes next month, April 27 after the bell.

"Auto Stock Roundup: Ford Reveals Weak Guidance; Honda, Toyota Outline Expansion Plans";3/30/2017;"The auto sector witnessed mixed developments over the last week, which was reflected in the share performance as well. Ford Motor CompanyFprovided a weak guidance for the first quarter of 2017.General Motors CompanyGMrejected an investor's proposal to split stocks into two classes as it would impact the financial flexibility of the company. Meanwhile, a large stake in Tesla, Inc.TSLAwas purchased by Chinese giant, Tencent.While Toyota Motor Corp.TMentered into a new patent licensing deal with Microsoft Corporation, in relation to connected car technologies, Honda Motor Co., Ltd.HMCand Ford announced investment plans in the U.S.(Read the previous roundup here:Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 23, 2017)Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories1. Ford provided a weak guidance for the first quarter of 2017. The company expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the range of 30-35 cents, lower than the 68 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. The company's projection also falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents per share. The low expectations are attributable to increased costs, lower volumes as well as unfavorable currency translations. Pre-tax income for 2017 continues to be forecast at below the $9 billion recorded in 2016.Ford has also announced two new recalls affecting 440,000 vehicles that will cost the company roughly $295 million.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).2. Tencent, one of China's most valuable companies, purchased 5% stake worth roughly $1.8 billion in Tesla, per a regulatory filing. This investment reveals investors' confidence in Tesla, ahead of the Model 3 production. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has been facing numerous questions regarding the company's ambitious plans for its latest vehicle. This investment comes at a time when the company is in a significant need for cash. Moreover, Tesla will also receive support for penetrating in the Chinese auto market.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3. Toyota entered into a new patent licensing deal with Microsoft Corporation in relation to connected car technologies.

3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Retreat;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's hard to findAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) bears most days, especially when the stock is continually resetting all-time highs. Less than 2% of Amazon's float is sold short, meaning even at these heights, very few bears are willing to bet against AMZN stock.makeArticleAd();Yet, here and there, contrarians get the best of Amazon, which has been prone to the occasional sharp setback amid its multiyear race through the stratosphere. The start of 2016 saw Amazon shares pull back by more than 25% in about a month-and-a-half, and AMZN yielded about 15% of ground between mid-October and mid-November of last year.In fact, even I'm a long-term bull on Amazon, but I'm also cautious - it pays to be. So right now, I'm paying attention to three near-term headwinds that could keep Amazon stock from pushing to even higher prices, and could make AMZN stock a good prospect for quick bearish options trades.Here's a look at three things that could hold Amazon back over the next month or so:Headwinds for AMZN StockA Recent Defeat:Amazon just announced yesterday that it's putting the kibosh on Quidsi, the operator of six shopping sites, foremost of which is Diapers.com. While AMZN isn't known for making big-ticket acquisitions, the Quidsi purchase in 2011 for $545 million still ranks among the company's top five.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right NowThe rationale?""We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable, and unfortunately we have not been able to do so. Quidsi has great brand expertise and they will continue to offer selection on Amazon.com; the software development team will focus on building technology for AmazonFresh.""AMZN is known for testing ideas with the willingness to accept failure, but there's something to be said about that failurea.)coming from an acquisition andb.)dealing with the core business of online retail.Quidsi has an additional barb that could stick in Amazon's craw. Co-founder and former CEO Marc Lore, who was brought over to Amazon as part of the acquisition, left after a few years to found Jet.com … whichWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) bought out in 2016, giving the big-box retailer much more ammunition on the online front.Amazon Go Delays:Amazon had Wall Street and Main Street alike singing of the coming death of other brick-and-mortar grocers in late December when it announcedAmazon Go- a new store concept that would change the way consumers shopoffline.The concept: Customers walk in and activate the Amazon Go app. They're then free to walk about the building, shop as they like, and leave without checking out. Instead, it uses sensors and other technology to determine what you've bought, and it charges you accordingly.This announcement drove a lot of excitement in AMZN stock, but the company recently admitted that it's not ready for a proper launch, and might not be for some time. Amazon, which is testing the concept in Seattle, can't track more than 20 customers simultaneously and is having difficulty tracking items once they're in customers' possession.So now, whereas Amazon was expecting a public launch by the end of March,the timetable has been pushed back indefinitely, dependent on when the company works out the kinks.For what it's worth, this isn't necessarily a bearish development for Amazon stock so much as it is … well, a delay. While investors were rabid about the concept, seeing the actual practical application will simply take more time to play out. In a way, AMZN's prudence is a positive, not rushing the concept to launch and instead making sure that when Amazon Go goes live, it's on point.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Hit New Highs in WeeksTechnicals:On the upside, Amazon's push to all-time highs has cracked any sort of overhead technical resistance. The stock is now trading above all of its major moving averages after bouncing off its 50-day MA just a few days ago.In fact, the only real downside is that the stock is starting to look overbought from a technical perspective according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI).It's not a perfect guide, and many stocks can continue to rise despite greatly overbought RSI. However, AMZN stock tends to respect this indicator - for instance, the October-November decline came after just a couple of weeks of overbought readings here.Bottom Line on AMZN StockNone of these three headwinds alone is a reason to worry about Amazon shares over the long haul, or even for the back half of this year.And valuation isn't worth mentioning, other than to say that while AMZN is trading at a triple-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio, that's never really mattered.Nonetheless, Amazon stock is starting to look technically frothy, by its standards, and with the company's next earnings report not due until late April, minor negative drivers could get the best of shares for the next month or so.This could be a good time to buy puts on AMZN, or attempt other bearish options strategies that benefit from flat to slightly lower trading.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Downright DangerousIf Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has a Shot at a Breakout, This Is It10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsThe post3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc.

3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy for Monster Profits;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are a lot of big-time shifts happening in the tech space right now, from the expansion of e-commerce to autonomous vehicles and virtual reality. While investors may disagree about which of those trends is a good bet for their portfolios, artificial intelligence is one area that most believe will see exponential growth in the years to come.makeArticleAd();Source: ©iStock.com/carloscastillaNearly every industry, from healthcare to finance and banking, is finding ways to use machine learning and AI in order to improve security, efficiency, training and even the customer experience. That means there will be plenty of opportunities for growth in the AI industry in the decade to come, so investors should be on the hunt for stocks to buy in this space.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsAlmost anyone who calls themselves a tech company is exploring AI in one way or another, but the stocks to buy in this space areInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM),Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).AI Stocks to Buy: International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)Source: ShutterstockIBM has had a tumultuous few years as technology changed and the firm's hardware offerings became antiquated.However, that was then and this is now - it's safe to say that IBM has successfully orchestrated a turnaround and the stock is on the upswing. The firm has done a lot of work to turn itself around over the last few years, but the most promising of IBM's ventures is Watson, a supercomputer capable of machine learning.Watson is able to sift through huge reams of data while constantly identifying new patterns and learning as it goes. That may sound like a pretty cool party trick, but Watson could revolutionize the healthcare industry by helping doctors make better diagnoses and using patients' data to find new correlations between symptoms and conditions that may never have occurred to the medical community.And healthcare is just the beginning, Watson is seen helping withsecurity, training and evencyber-bullying.AI Stocks to Buy:Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)Source: ShutterstockGraphics chipmaker NVDA is another smart play in the AI industry, because the firm's processors have been touted as top of the line. NVDA's GPUs have been praised by automakers likeTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),who are planning to use the chipsin upcoming models that will have autonomous driving features.NVDA is a good bet because the firm is not only an AI play, but it is an autonomous vehicle investment as well. The company has ingrained itself in the autonomous driving space, and as automobiles get more and more advanced, Nvidia chips will be powering those improvements.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementHowever, self-driving cars aren't the only catalysts for NVDA in the AI space.The firm has also seen massive revenue growthin gaming, professional visualization and its data center business. Nvidia has made a name for itself as an AI firm and the company is likely to ride the growing wave of AI potential throughout the next decade.AI Stocks to Buy:Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockYou can't talk about AI stocks to buy without including e-commerce giant Amazon on the list. The firm has been pouring resources into the development of its AI arm, saying it has the potential to become one of the firm's core businesses.AMZN's virtual assistant Alexa is a prime example of the firm's potential in the AI space. She boasts thousands of commands and is constantly learning the more she is used by customers. Amazon has made it a priority to improve speech recognition and Alexa is blazing the trail ahead.Not only that, but AMZN is using its AI know-how to create cashier-less grocery stores that will allow shoppers to simply log-in to the store, put the items they want into their bags and walk out. The concept would eliminate the need to wait in line or open your wallet, instead charging customers through their Amazon account.The best thing about AMZN's AI developments is that the company has the resources to develop and implement them all by itself. Amazon is working on everything fromfloating warehousesthat supply delivery drones to an all-inclusive Prime ecosystem that is able to anticipate a customer's need before they realize it themselves. The firm's focus on innovation in the AI space will not only benefit AMZN's other businesses, but it will make Amazon a major player within the industry.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AMZN.The post3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy for Monster Profitsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tencent Buys 5% Stake in Tesla: ETFs in Focus;3/30/2017;"China's Tencent Holdings has bought a 5% stake in U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc.TSLAfor $1.78 billion. This deal extends China's presence in the U.S. automobile technology sector. The new technologies developed by U.S carmakers have attracted huge investments from Chinese companies.This deal comes at a time when Tesla is gearing up to launch its Model 3 later this year. The cash infusion could help the company in a great way. Analysts predict that Tencent could help Tesla get deeper into the Chinese markets, which is the largest automobile market in the world. Even though Tesla's China sales tripled last year, it was still less than a quarter of its U.S. sales.makeArticleAd();Tencent is one of Asia's largest tech companies with a market cap of $275 billion, almost six times that of Tesla.  It is best known for its mobile messaging app WeChat. It had earlier invested in Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup Nio (previously NextEV) and Didi Chuxing, the second largest ride sharing service company in the world.Investors believe Tencent can be a great navigator for Tesla, not just in terms of increasing sales in China but also helping the Palo-Alto based carmaker expand its vehicular technology (see:all the Alternative Energy ETFs here).Shares of Tesla rose 2.7% to close at $277.45 on Tuesday, March 28, 2017. What's surprising is that Tesla's market cap is just around $1 billion short of that of Ford. As a comparison, Ford sold 6.65 million cars last year compared with 80,000 for Tesla (read:Platinum ETF in Focus Amid High Inflows).In the light of the recent development, let's take a look at some ETFs that have significant exposure to Tesla:VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETFGEXThis fund tracks the Ardour Global Index, focusing on companies that are primarily engaged in the business of alternative energy.  It also provides good diversification in the sense that its holdings are well divided between large, medium and small cap companies.The fund has AUM of $67.9 million and charges 62 bps in fees per year. The fund has an average daily volume of about 4100 shares. Tesla Motors occupies the top position in the basket with about 11.95% allocation. In terms of country exposure, the fund is skewed toward the U.S. with 53% share while Denmark also has a double-digit allocation with 11.8%. The fund has added about 3.33% in the past one year and 8.8% so far this year (as of March 29, 2017).ARK Industrial Innovation ETFARKQThis fund does not track any index in particular as it is an actively managed ETF seeking long-term capital appreciation. It looks for companies that stand to gain from the development of new products or services, or technological improvement and advancements in scientific research.As such, the fund's top rank holder is Tesla with an 11.6% holding. The fund has AUM of approximately $24.2 million and charges a fee of 75 basis points a year.  The average daily volume is about 8,700 shares. With more than 80% exposure to the U.S. equity market, it provides good diversification across large-, medium- and small cap companies. The fund has gained around 29.07% in the past one year and about 11.4% in the year-to-date frame (as of March 29, 2017).ARK Innovation ETFARKKThis is an actively managed fund like ARKQ, providing significant exposure to the domestic technology and health care companies among others. The fund provides 9% exposure to Tesla.The product has accumulated $17.7 million in its asset base and trades in an average volume of about 5,100 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 75 bps a year. The fund is also well-diversified among large-, medium- and small-cap companies.  It has gained 24.36% in the past one year and 18.65% in the year-to date time frame (as of March 29, 2017).Bottom LineTencent's investment comes in as a vote of confidence in Elon Musk and the future of this sector. With more than 373,000 pre orders for Model 3, Tesla is pinning its hopes on this launch to gain market share. Moreover, with city mayors enquiring about electric vehicles for commercial purposes, like police cruisers and street sweepers, the future of this industry looks bright (read:Electric Cars Find Favor with City Administrators: ETFs in Focus).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Lose Its App Store Crown to Android;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA new report has been released with comprehensive stats for the global market for mobile apps. App Annie says thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) served up a fraction of the downloads ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play for 2016, yet continued to dominate the revenue side of the business.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleApple's App Store revenue is predicted to continue topping Google Play as the most lucrative through to 2021. It's expected that all Android app stores combined will overtake Apple's App Store sales at some point this year.Report on Mobile App Downloads and RevenueApp Annie is a firm that tracks global app downloads and app store revenue. A detailed report - which was made available onAppleInsider- sheds light onwhat's currently happening in the mobile app market, along with forecasts to 2021.According to App Annie, AAPL's App Store revenue is about to be surpassed for the first time by the combination of Google Play and third party Android app stores. While Apple remained on top for 2016, with $34 billion in app sales versus a combined $27 billion for Android, in 2017 the lead is expected to shift. Apple App Store revenue is pegged at $40 billion, while Android app stores are on track to book a combined $41 billion.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementApple continues to be on top as the single largest app store by sales, with its $40 billion for 2017 expected to nearly double second place Google Play's $21 billion. Apple's iOS also stays firmly in the lead as the platform where users are most likely to pay for apps. Apple's $40 billion in revenue is expected to come from 30 billion downloads. Google Play's $21 billion will come from 114 billion downloads, making Apple's App Store a much more lucrative prospect for developers.The App Annie numbers show that Android's sheer numbers advantage, however, is once again showing results.Apple App Store Revenue ExplainsSuper Mario RunOne of the best recent examples of how the difference between appdownloadsversus apppurchasesplays out wasNintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)'s(OTCMKTS:NTDOY)Super Mario Run.This was Nintendo's first full-fledged foray into mobile gaming. Built around one of the most recognizable Nintendo characters of all time, smartphone ownerssalivated at the chance to play.When the game was released in 2016, if one platform was going to have an edge at getting Mario first, sheer numbers would say it should have been Google Play. With more than double the downloads of the Apple App Store, Google Play would have putSuper Mario Runonto a lot more devices. But Nintendochose to make Super Mario run an iOS exclusiveinstead.Despite there being far fewer iPhones out there than Android smartphones, AAPL's App Store revenue shows that those iPhone users are far more likely topayfor a game. Android users had to wait until last week to finally get their hands on the title. And that's been the model that many premium app developers continue to follow, despite Google Play's numbers lead.If it's a high-profile app that cost a lot to develop and you expect people to pay for it, the Apple App Store tends to get it first - if Google Play gets it at all.Will the Shift to Android Dominance Hurt Apple?Services - which includes App Store revenue - has become anincreasingly important division for AAPL. It posted the highest growth of any of Apple's divisions last year and AAPL netted $3 billion in revenue from app downloads last December alone.Is that revenue in jeopardy? That shouldn't be the case, for three reasons.First, the Apple App Store is expected to remain comfortably on top as the single largest app store for revenue through 2021.Second, a huge chunk of the revenue growth on the Android side is coming from third party Chinese app stores. These tend to be focused on that market, and don't compete against the West.Third, every year it gets more difficult and more expensive to develop and support apps for Android. There are so many versions of the operating system in use and so many different smartphones running it that testing and ensuring a good user experience - something that's critical for premium apps - is time consuming, costly and still doesn't guarantee results.Bottom Line on Apple's App StoreApple has weathered a number of negative milestones as a result of the sheer numbers of Android users. In 2011, the number of Android smartphones leapt past the number of iPhones in the American market. In 2013, Google Play took the lead in the number of app downloads for the first time. And in 2015, the Apple App Store was surpassed by Google Play for having the most apps available.If Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has a Shot at a Breakout, This Is ItDespite the dominance of Android smartphones, App Store sales continue growing at a healthy pace, and it's expected to keep doing so despite the latest stat. According to App Annie's predictions, that means growth to $40 billion in revenue this year and $60 billion by 2021 (compared to $78 billion combined for Android). Not bad for a platform expected to see appdownloadsat that time outnumbered 7-to-1 by the competition.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best REITs to Buy for Big (And Growing!)

Best Stocks for 2017: Albemarle Corporation’s (ALB) Outlook Remains Bullish;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEditor's note: This column is part of ourBest Stocks for 2017contest. Matt McCall's pick for the contest isAlbemarle Corporation(NYSE:ALB).makeArticleAd();It's hard to believe it has already been more than three months since I was introduced toInvestorPlace.com'sBest Stocks for 2017 contest. As Imentioned then, picking just one stock to outperform for the year ahead is a daunting task, but it was a challenge I was more than willing to take on! I'm very pleased to say that my top-down strategy, which puts a heavy focus on industry groups, pointed me in the right direction.My pick for the best stock of the year isAlbemarle Corporation(NYSE:ALB), a global specialty chemicals company that is a leader in lithium, bromine, refining catalysts and applied surface treatments. It's one of three major global players in the lithium sector and owns lithium brine operations in Chile and the United States, as well as a stake in a mine in Australia.How ALB Stock Has Been FaringAlbemarle has spent the first quarter hard at work expanding its lithium business to keep up with rising demand around the globe. In January, it amended an existing agreement with the Chilean Economic Development Agency to extend the terms out 27 years.The agreement is expected to more than triple the lithium quota in Chile.Then in March, ALB stock'sTalisonjoint venture in Australia approved an expansion of its lithium production at its Greenbushes mine, which will double the current output.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementFrom a top-down view, chemical companies with exposure to lithium will continue to be the best-positioned in the current environment, and I like that Albemarle is at the forefront of the industry. Plus, a strengthening global economy will boost the chemical sector overall.ALB stock has also kept up its solid earnings track record, reporting fourth-quarter numbers that beat the Street in February. Adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share werebetter than the expected75 cents a share, and revenue of $696.7 million bested estimates of $646.4 million.On the conference call, management said that ALB's 2016 performance and strategic initiatives have positioned it well for strong growth in 2017. For the full year, they guided for earnings of $4-$4.25 a share, a 17% year-over-year increase at the midpoint, on revenue of $2.8 billion-$2.95 billion. And the growth isn't limited to just next year. Looking out even further to 2018, management expects to increase profit by another 16%.In the end, I think those estimates are too low and suspect the company will continue its trend of beating the Street's expectations. The latest report from ALB stock was taken very well by the market and the stock soared to a new all-time high the following day.The Albemarle Stock ChartLooking at ALB from a technical perspective, you can see that the shares have been consolidating their gains following the post-earnings rally:The breakout to new highs has been confirmed, as the stock has not pulled back since its gap to the upside, and that's even more bullish when you consider the fact that ALB stock has been trending higher even as it consolidates.If Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has a Shot at a Breakout, This Is ItAlbemarle has gotten off to a great start in 2017 - it's up 23% year to date! - and I expect the higher highs to keep on coming.ALB stock remains a favorite of mine for this year and beyond.Matthew McCall is founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm.

Or not.Tesla Isn't an InvestmentIt's been said before (by yours truly), but it bears repeating: TSLA stock isn't an investment, but rather, a trade based on a guess of how the market is going to collectively feel about the company six months in the future.It's becoming more investment-like, to be fair, now that consistent profits are at least on the radar and the recurring fundraisers seem to be slowing down as the company becomes more self-sufficient. It's still mostly a trade, though, so reading the technical tea leaves remains an integral part of the game.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementWith that as the backdrop, the chart below tells the story quite clearly: Tesla stock has been range-bound since 2014. Trapped between $179 and $286, with a minor floor at $195 occasionally playing a role. Eventually, the ceiling at $286 is going to fail. Once that jailbreak happens, a flood of would-be buyers could jump in and forge the beginnings of a sizeable melt-up.Click to EnlargeThis may well be the beginning of that move.What's so distinctly different about the bullishness that's materialized over the course of the past three weeks isn't difficult to see; unlike the prior two ceiling attempts, this one didn't result in a slide to the lower edge of the trading range. This one only peeled back to $242 (blue) before a floor was made. The three-week rally pushed up and off that support line.It's encouraging simply because rather than being forced to traverse the whole $107 span between $179 and $286 and then be expected to have enough gas in the tank to keep on truckin', TSLA stock is only going to need to travel $44 before reaching the ceiling at $286.There's apt to be enough buying interest (and less profit-taking pressure) with that scenario than there has been with the other encounters with $286, setting up a possible breakout. If TSLA can just clear the ceiling, it could spark a move on the order of 100 points or so … roughly the same height of the well-established trading range it's trying to break out of now.Bottom Line for TSLA StockObviously, there are never any guarantees. Tesla stock is a particularly funny bird to trade simply because everyone - professional and amateur alike - has a strong opinion on it. That kind of tension can pull the rug out from underneath any conventional technical analysis. The stock may simply bump into $283 and do what it's done the past two times - rollover.By and large, TSLA has actually behaved pretty predictably for the past several years - in terms of technical analysis - so it wouldn't be crazy to put this potential trade on your radar. The company's certainly got more going for it now, fundamentally, than it ever has before.Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is About to Get Even BloodierThe one often-overlooked clue you'll want to look for is better buying volume during and shortly after any break past $286. We don't quite see enough bullish volume yet, though it could very likely materialize as TSLA stock approaches and then starts to clear the big technical ceiling.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Construction Stocks That Aren't Making You Great Again5 Energy Stocks to Buy as They Power UpThe postIf Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has a Shot at a Breakout, This Is Itappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Best Buy, Rocky Brands and Tesla highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;3/29/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - March 29, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsBest Buy(NYSE:BBY-Free Report) as the Bull of the Day,Rocky Brands(NASDAQ:RCKY-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:Bull of the Day:It has been a challenging environment for most retailers as more and more shoppers now prefer to shop online. Amazon now accounts for more than half ofevery new dollar spentonline in America and few retailers are able to compete with the e-commerce giant. Best Buy is one of those select retailers. It is the Bull of the Day today.About the CompanyHeadquartered in Richfield, MN,Best Buy(NYSE:BBY-Free Report)is a leading specialty retailer of technology products, services and solutions, with approximately 1,600 stores in North America. Domestic Operations accounted for 92% of FY17 total revenue.According to the company, 70% of the U.S. population lives within 15 minutes of a Best Buy store. That has helped the retailer to improve its e-commerce operations as shoppers can purchase online and pick up from a nearby Best Buy store, within two days in most cases.Q4 Earning BeatThe retailer reported on March 1. Adjusted earnings of $1.95 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66, and were up 27.5% from the prior-year quarter. Total revenues of $13,482 million, were however shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,608 million.Guidance was also below street estimates and shares fell about 4.5% after the report. They have recovered nicely since then as bargain hunters rushed to buy the dips.Returning Capital to ShareholdersBest Buy continues to boost shareholders' value through dividends and share repurchases. Earlier this month, they announced a new $3 billion share repurchase plan expected to be completed over the next two years as well as a 21% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share. During the reported quarter, they returned approximately $314 million via share repurchases and dividends.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY 2017 and FY 2018 have surged to $3.68 per share and $3.94 per share respectively, up from $3.50 and $3.69, before the results.Bear of the Day:Headquartered in Nelsonville, OH,Rocky Brands(NASDAQ:RCKY-Free Report)designs, develops, manufactures and markets outdoor, work and military footwear as well as outdoor and work apparel and accessories.They own a portfolio of well recognized brand names including Rocky Outdoor Gear, Georgia Boot, Durango, Lehigh, and the licensed brand, Dickies. Their product line includes rugged outdoor footwear, including hunting and hiking boots.Disappointing Results and GuidanceThe retailer reported a fourth quarter net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.18 per share in the year ago period.Adjusted net income $0.18 per share was significantly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.29 per share. This was the sixth consecutive miss for the company. Their average quarterly surprise for the last four quarter is more than (negative) 90%.""Overall, gross margins were further pressured by the need to increase our promotional activity to help clear out Work, Western, and Hunting wholesale channels of inventory carried over in 2016 by many retailers following the warm winter of the prior year.""""Adding to this headwind was the fact that store traffic was and continues to be down for the majority of our brick and mortar accounts as consumers increasingly shift their shopping to online,"" said the CEO.Falling EstimatesAnalysts have been cutting their estimates for the company after quarterly results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year have plunged to $0.80 per share and $0.96 per share respectively, down from $0.89 and $1.00 per share, before the results. Declining estimates sent the stock back to Zacks Rank # 5.Additional content:What Is Neuralink, Elon Musk's Brand New Company?Elon Musk, the man behind electric car company Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) and rocket and spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX, is launching a new company dedicated to creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain. DubbedNeuralink,the venture aims to eventually help humans merge with computer software in order to keep pace with artificial intelligence advancements, according toThe Wall Street Journal.Neuralink is looking to develop something called ""neural lace technology,"" which involves implanting electrodes into human brains that allow for the uploading and downloading of thoughts to a computer. TheWSJreport discusses how this technology could improve human cognitive function, and that Neuralink wants to explore how to alleviate the symptoms of chronic medical conditions, like depression, epilepsy, and even Parkinson's.Musk, it seems, has been interested in the relationship between humans and computers for a while now.Speakingat the World Government Summit in Dubai in February, he said that ""Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence."" Musk thinks human beings need to help advance the ability to communicate directly with machines, or basically risk irrelevance.Even last year, at Vox Media'sCode Conference, Musk brought up the potential benefits of neural lace technology, something that is surgically connected to a human brain and allows users to interact with a computer without the need for input methods like keyboards or trackpads.Neural lace could prevent people from becoming ""house cats"" compared to artificial intelligence, says Musk. ""I don't love the idea of being a house cat, but what's the solution? I think one of the solutions that seems maybe the best is to add an AI layer. A third, digital layer that could work well and symbiotically,"" he said at the conference.TechCrunchpoints out that this is pretty much how Tesla and SpaceX started: a key product grounded in one big, grand idea. Mass-produced, long-range electric vehicles and sustainable energy? Check. Landing and colonizing Mars? Check. Taking on artificial intelligence by turning into a semi-robot?

Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Jumping Higher;3/29/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this month,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) announced the Jetson TX2, which is the latest iteration of the TX1, which NVDA describes as""the world's first supercomputer on a module.""The company designed the Jetson module as a tool to assist developers in advancing and creating new technology. Additionally, in partnership withMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia announced development of theHGX-1 Hyperscale GPU Accelerator, which promises improved performance and standardization for cloud-computing servers.makeArticleAd();Source: NvidiaThese tools will also serve NVDA stock investors (indirectly, of course), as they further the company's rise to the top of the AI industry ladder.Android Centraldescribed the Jetson TX2 best,saying:""The people who will build this technology of the future will need the tools to do so. In 2017, NVIDIA is doing its part, and the Jetson TX2 is the embodiment of this idea.""Simply put, the Jetson TX2 is a mini supercomputer that can process massive amounts of data on the spot, which can be a huge advantage for technology developers who would otherwise have had to upload all that data to an online server for cloud computing.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsWhat's more, NVDA's Jetson TX2 is capable of ""edge"" machine learning, a term that refers to the ability of the module to process, interpret and analyze data without the need to first upload it to the cloud, then download the resulting information and details. The TX2 has served its purpose quite successfully and it has helped Nvidia achieve its goal of simplifying developers' processes by reducing the number of steps required to garner important data.As far as the HGX-1, NVDAbelievesthat:The HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator will do for AI cloud computing what the ATX standard did to make PCs pervasive today. It will enable cloud-service providers to easily adopt NVIDIA GPUs to meet surging demand for AI computing.More Iconic Brands Rely on NVDA Than You Might RealizeHistorically, Nvidia has been known for its industry-leading graphics cards. But, NVDA stock is much more than a computer GPU maker. Sure, the company still produces some of the most advanced GPUs that make hardcore gamers drool, but graphics processors are actually capable of much more.While high-end GPUs will, obviously, improve PC video quality and reduce or eliminate that annoying screen lag when you're playing a first-person shooter game, they're also used for a surprising number of non-visual applications.For instance,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) use Nvidia GPU technology in the development of their respective driverless cars.Volkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY) andDaimler AG's(OTCMKTS:DDAIF) Audi brand have also been using Nvidia GPU units in their own driverless vehicle development projects. These companiesuse the NVDA Drive PX2- which, according toForbes,shares the renowned Tegra Parker silicon as the Jetson TX2.Beyond just autonomous vehicles, though, Nvidia GPU devices have been used by medical scientists and pharmaceutical companies to investigate and better understand the effects of aging. Using GPUs made by NVDA, biotech companies such asInSilicoemploy AI to analyze large data sets and""emulate human brain function""in an attempt to combat diseases related to old age and reduce the cost of healthcare.Why the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Comeback Is Just BeginningSimilarly, at its annual Open Compute Project summit earlier this month,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) announced a cutting-edge AI server dubbed Big Basin, which features""no less than eight Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU accelerators.""Bottom Line on NVDA StockAll things considered, Nvidia stock's meteoric rise in the field of artificial intelligence shows no signs of slowing. With the release of the Jetson TX2 module, coupled with the upcoming HGX-1 accelerator, NVDA stock has addressed - seemingly quite successfully - mobile/field R&D as well as the cloud computing needs of AI developers.For Nvidia stock, this is a solid sign that the past year's 213% gains will continue.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right NowThe postWhy Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Jumping Higherappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Wednesday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Ford Motor Company (F);3/29/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed this morning after Wall Street digests a strong rally driven by better-than-expected economic data on Tuesday. This morning, investors are keeping an eye on Fed speeches, as well as Brexit, with the U.K. invoking Article 50 and officially starting the country's withdrawal from the EU.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.10%, whileS&P 500futures dipped 0.05% andNasdaq-100futures have risen 0.02%.On the options front, volume normalized a bit on Tuesday, with roughly 14.3 million calls and 12.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.60 and the 10-day moving average ticked lower once again to 0.65.The 7 Best REITs to Buy for Big (And Growing!) YieldsDriving Tuesday's options volume,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) saw additional call option volume following a JPMorgan price-target hike. Elsewhere,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) also drew higher call volume after announcing new features to compete withSnap Inc(NASDAQ:SNAP) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) announced it was building a new $200 million new advanced data center.Apple Inc. (AAPL)The much anticipated 10th anniversary edition of Apple's iPhone is slated for release this fall, and analysts at JPMorgan believe the device has plenty of pent up demand waiting in the wings.In a note to clients yesterday, JPMorgan reiterated its ""overweight"" rating and lifted its price target from $142 to $165. The brokerage firm also lifted its earnings projections to $11.74 per share for 2018 and its unit forecast from 245 million to 260 million units for the same period.While bullish activity was dampened by the recent market correction, AAPL options traders piled into calls yesterday. Total volume rose to nearly 1.5 million contracts, with calls accounting for 60% of the day's take. However, recent call activity appears to be more of the short-term profit-taking variety, as the April put/call open interest ratio has risen from Monday's perch at 0.90 to today's reading of 0.95, as puts are added at a faster rate than calls.This shift in sentiment isn't much to worry about right now, with AAPL holding firmly above $140, but a breach of support here could create cause for concern and prompt a spike in AAPL put options.Facebook Inc (FB)Facebook rolled out more features in its quest to remain competitive with social media upstart Snap yesterday.The company announcedwhat it called ""More ways to to share with the Facebook camera,"" including filters, a ""Stories"" feature that had already rolled out on Instagram, and direct photo sharing - all popular features currently on SnapChat.Options traders appeared to back the new features, with calls accounting for 65% of the more than 383,000 contracts traded on FB stock yesterday. What's more, the April put/call open interest ratio continued its recent decline, arriving at 0.44 this morning. In other words, FB options traders continue to add calls at a faster rate than puts on the stock, as expectations for a continued uptrend remain strong. Currently, peak April OI lies at the in-the-money $140 strike, but the overhead $145 and $150 are quickly gaining in popularity.Ford Motor Company (F)After revealing weak first-quarter estimates on Monday,Ford threw investors a boneyesterday by announcing $1.2 billion in investments at three of its Michigan plants. However, most of that $1.2 billion was previously announced, including $850 million for an assembly line for the new Ford Bronco and Ranger. New to the program was $200 million for a new advanced data center and $150 million for expansion of an engine plant - adding to $700 million in previously announced investment.According to Ford, the  plant investments are ""consistent with what we agreed to and talked about with the UAW in 2015 negotiations.""Trade Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock to the TopOptions traders remained broadly positive about the growth, however, sending 204,000 contracts across the tape, with calls snapping up a hefty 77% of the day's take. The renewed attention to calls could mark the start of a reversal in sentiment for F stock, as the shares' April put/call open interest ratio has ticked lower from 1.02 on Friday to 1.00 as of this morning. After falling more than 9% since March 17, F stock could use a bit of optimism.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Investments to Buy If the 'Trump Trade' Reverses Course4 Retail REITs That Must Face the MusicThe postWednesday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Is Daimler Stock a Good Way to Invest in Self-Driving Cars?;3/28/2017;"Self-driving cars are coming. In time, the technology is   likely to transform the way we get around -- and it might even   transform cars (and trucks) as we know them.It's generally true that transformative changes bring   investment opportunities for those who are paying attention. So   how do we invest in self-driving cars -- or, as they're properly   termed, autonomous vehicles?I've been looking carefully at the public companies known to   be working on some aspect of autonomous vehicle technology, in   search of good opportunities for investors to profit from these   changes. Lately, I keep coming back to one that most U.S.   investors seem to overlook: The company that's credited with   inventing the car itself.makeArticleAd();The first car with (very limited) self-driving capability?     It wasn't a Tesla, it was the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class with     Daimler's Traffic Jam Assist system. Image source: Daimler     AG.Daimler is not just a luxury-car companyDaimler AG(NASDAQOTH: DDAIF) is mostly known to U.S. investors as the maker   of Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles. That's an important part of the   company's business. But it's more than that: Daimler is also a   major global producer of medium and heavy trucks and buses under   several brands, including Freightliner and the Mercedes-Benz   commercial-vehicle brand.Why is that important? Daimler appears to be well along in the   process of developing its own autonomous-vehicle system. Daimler   has been investing in autonomous-driving research and development   for many years. The company will always have the distinction of   being the veryfirst to bring a hands-off-the-steering-wheel   system to market, on the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan.It's also making big investments in (and good progress with)   battery-electric drivetrains. Both technologies have obvious   near-future applications in luxury cars, of course, asMercedes gears up to push back against   upstartTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)  over the next few years.But the more significant opportunity for Daimler over the next   several years may be in automated (and eventually, electrified)   long-haul trucking. Daimler may well lead that transition: Among   other efforts, it has been testing a system called ""Highway   Pilot"" that allowsautomated tractor-trailersto ""platoon,"" or drive in a closely spaced, automated convoy.Mercedes-Benz tractor-trailer trucks fitted with a prototype     of its Highway Pilot system are shown moving in an automated     platoon in a test last year. Note the position of the driver's     hands. Image source: Daimler AG.Think that technology might have commercial implications?   Absolutely. By the way, Daimler is also gearing up to produce the   latest version of its electric light-duty truck (think of an   urban delivery van) and is working on electricheavy trucksthat will go into mass production in a few years.Daimler's Fuso eCanter is a battery-electric commercial     truck that will soon be available with battery packs up to 84     kWh. Image source: Daimler AG.Daimler, together with rivalsBMW(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF)  andAudiand chip giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) also owns a piece of HERE. HERE is the mapping   company that began life many years ago as NAVTEQ. It's   significance now is that it is expected to be a key supplier   of the highly detailed maps that will be needed by the first   Level 4 autonomous vehicles. It's another piece of the   autonomous-vehicle puzzle that might prove significant in a few   years: The more maps a given self-driving system   has available, the more places it will be able to go without   intervention from a human driver.To sum up: As a luxury-car maker, Daimler is in a good   position to profit from the early stages of the self-driving   revolution (when autonomous capabilities might be an expensive   option on premium sedans and SUVs). But the bigger opportunity   for Daimler may lie in self-driving trucks, whether urban   delivery vans or long-haul tractor trailers. Taken together,   there's potential for a significant bottom-line boost as the   technologies come to market over the next several years.Daimler as an investmentRight now, Daimler has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 8.8,   making it a little undervalued by long-term automaker standards   (10 times earnings is more typical for an automaker in good   economic times).Daimler is expected to pay a dividend of 3.25 euros this year,   same as last year, for a 41% payout ratio and a rich dividend   yield of about 4.6%. (That fat yield is another sign that the   stock might be undervalued.)Daimler's current management team is a strong one. Led by CEO   Dieter Zetsche, the group has boosted the company's profit   margins over the last few years while making what appear to be   the right investments for the future.Long story short: If you're looking for ways beyond the   obvious to invest in the coming wave of autonomous cars (and   trucks), Daimler is worth a closer look.10 stocks we like better than Daimler AGWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD) Stock Flies 20%, Clobbers the Shorts;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) gained another 20% on Tuesday to extend an improbable run. SHLD stock, which dropped 12% the day the retailer expressed doubt in its ""ability to continue as a going concern,"" has since pushed nearly 40% higher.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrWhat gives?Well, despite the likelihood that this story will likely end with Sears bankrupt and Sears stock holders left with nothing, institutional money has poured in, and that has been enough to shake out a considerable short crowd.Specifically, Fairholme Capital Management's Bruce Berkowitz purchased 287,000 shares of Sears stock between March 23 and March 27 for anywhere between $8.05 and $8.46 per share, according to a filing out Monday. A second filing showed that Fairholme bought 614,000 shares between March 20 and March 22.CEO Eddie Lampert also gave his company a vote of wallet confidence with his own 526,000-share purchase between March 22 and March 24, according to a Friday filing.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in AprilThose purchases set off a spark on the powder keg of shorts sitting in SHLD stock. Specifically, more than 78% of Sears' float - which doesn't include what Lampert and Fairholme own - was held short as of the most recently available data. That's good for a short ratio of 7.5 - meaning it would take seven-and-a-half days of buying at average daily volume to clear out all the shorts in Sears.Surely, they're trying.The big bets come as Sears' operational results become more and more comically awful. Revenues have sunk from $36.2 billion to $22.1 billion in just three years, and losses have ballooned from $1.4 billion to $2.2 billion in that time. SHLD sits on just less than $300 million in cash versus $3.6 billion in long-term debt - an increasingly untenable situation that seems destined to end in pain.Sears' ""going concern"" language is essentially a nod to that idea - and that despite its continued promises of a turnaround, SHLD stock is a dead equity walking.But today, the zombie is feasting.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

What is Neuralink, Elon Musk's Brand New Company?;3/28/2017;"Elon Musk, the man behind electric car company Tesla Inc.TSLAand rocket and spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX, is launching a new company dedicated to creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain. DubbedNeuralink,the venture aims to eventually help humans merge with computer software in order to keep pace with artificial intelligence advancements, according toThe Wall Street Journal.Neuralink is looking to develop something called ""neural lace technology,"" which involves implanting electrodes into human brains that allow for the uploading and downloading of thoughts to a computer. TheWSJreport discusses how this technology could improve human cognitive function, and that Neuralink wants to explore how to alleviate the symptoms of chronic medical conditions, like depression, epilepsy, and even Parkinson's.Long Neuralink piece coming out on@waitbutwhyin about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)March 28, 2017Musk, it seems, has been interested in the relationship between humans and computers for a while now.Speakingat the World Government Summit in Dubai in February, he said that ""Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence."" Musk thinks human beings need to help advance the ability to communicate directly with machines, or basically risk irrelevance.Even last year, at Vox Media'sCode Conference, Musk brought up the potential benefits of neural lace technology, something that is surgically connected to a human brain and allows users to interact with a computer without the need for input methods like keyboards or trackpads.Neural lace could prevent people from becoming ""house cats"" compared to artificial intelligence, says Musk. ""I don't love the idea of being a house cat, but what's the solution? I think one of the solutions that seems maybe the best is to add an AI layer. A third, digital layer that could work well and symbiotically,"" he said at the conference.TechCrunchpoints out that this is pretty much how Tesla and SpaceX started: a key product grounded in one big, grand idea.

Tesla (TSLA) Stock Jumps After Tencent Buys 5% Stake;3/28/2017;"Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.TCEHYhas purchased a 5% stake in Tesla Inc.TSLAaccording to a recently released U.S. regulatory filing. The purchase makes Tencent one of Tesla's biggest investors at a time when Tesla desperately needs to raise money.Tencent, one of China's most valuable companies, paid roughly $1.8 billion for its 5% stake in Tesla. Tencent purchased 8.17 million shares through a recentTesla stockoffering and the open market. Tencent's 5% stake makes it Tesla'sfifth-largest shareholder, according to Bloomberg. The Chinese company took a passive stake in Tesla, which means it is unlikely to try to pressure the electric car maker to make any changes.In the wake of the news, Tesla's stock rose 3.42% to $279.39 per share in early afternoon trading Tuesday. Tesla is a Zacks Rank #3 (HOLD).Tencent is hardly well-known outside China, but it is theworld's largest video game publisher by revenue. The company now owns both ""League of Legends"" and ""Clash of Clans,"" two massively popular video games. Tencent also owns two major Chinese social-media platforms WeChat and Weixin, which boast 890 million monthly active users combined.In early January 2011, Tencent's stock price was $4.51 per share. Today, Tencent's stock is up 1.75% to $29.49 per share and is a Zacks Rank #3 (HOLD). With a market cap of $276.6 billion, the Internet giant is now worth more than Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.BABA, which has a market cap of $269.7 billion.The major Tencent investment comes as Tesla continues topush towards the launchof its first mass-market car, the Model 3, in late 2017. Tesla plans to begin manufacturing its new less-expensive electric car by summer 2017 in order to start fulfilling the 373,000 pre-orders of the $35,000 Model 3 sedan.Tesla needs to raise a massive amount of money in order to produce the new electric sedans. Tencent's major investment is a start.The electric car company has over $2 billion worth of debt due in 2018. Still, Tesla's stock price has climbed 26% in 2017, and the company has reached a market cap of $45.5 billion. Tesla is nowthe second most valuable U.S. autocompany behind only General MotorsGM.Tesla has grown its presence in China, where it now has 24 stores and 348 regular charging stations. China imported 11,839 Tesla vehicles in 2016,five times morethan the previous year.Is Musk Overselling The Massive Model 3 Roll   Out?Tesla's chairman and largest shareholder Elon Musk's plan to transform his company from a luxury electric car company into a sustainable energy powerhouse is in full swing. But the introduction of its new solar power and sustainable battery businesses, as well as a new mass-market electric car has done little to help improve Tesla's debt-laden and unprofitable bottom line.Musk hopes to produce 500,000 electric vehicles a year by the end of 2018 and 1 million by 2020. In order to do so, Tesla said earlier this month it would try to raise a total of nearly $1.4 billion through a stock and debt offering.On a call with investors last month, Musk said the company is ready to place orders with suppliers for ""1,000 cars a week in July, 2,000 a week in August, and 4,000 a week in September."" Tesla hopes to push that number to 5,000 cars a week by the end of 2017 and to 10,000 a week by the end of 2018.But the massive roll out of that many electric cars ""would be absolutely unprecedented based on what we know about car markets today and how people spend their dollars,""Bloomberg electric car analyst Salim Morsy said. ""It could happen. I'm pretty sure it won't.""Other Tesla EndeavorsTesla announced it isready to enter the Middle East market, opening a pop-up store and a service center by July to sell its luxury electric cars in the United Arab Emirates. Tesla has similar plans for Abu Dhabi by 2018.South Africa, Musk's home country, has been in talks with the Silicon Valley-based company to open a manufacturing plant there. Musk also recently announced his intentions tobring Tesla to India. Tesla's $2.1 billion acquisition of solar power giant SolarCity signaled its massive move into the sustainable energy sector.Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp (SpaceX) plans to make history this week when it hopes to launch a rocket into space usingengine boosters that have already been used. SpaceX's Thursday launch at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida is set to prove that the use of previously fired engines makes frequent and cheaper space travel possible. Musk and SpaceX want to begin tocolonize Mars by 2024.The South African entrepreneur just launched a new company called Neuralink Corp as he tries tofuse computers with human brainsin order to help mankind compete during the upcoming age of artificial intelligence and robotics.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!makeArticleAd();It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Yes, Tencent’s Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stake Is a BIG Buy Signal;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) might be strange bedfellows. The former makes electric cars and solar roofs. The latter is the primary name behind online messaging appWeChat(though it sells and supports a variety of apps).makeArticleAd();Nevertheless, Tencent recently acquired $1.8 billion worth of TSLA stock, making the Chinese technology outfit the fifth largest Tesla stock holder. That resulted in a 3% bump to TSLA stock by Tuesday afternoon.Faithful fans of Tesla and equally faithful owners of the stock are clearly stoked, holding the sizable purchase up as a trophy of sorts. They might want to be a little careful about reading too much into the news … particularly as a hint that the young carmaker is on the cusp of being acquired.On the other hand, there's no denying Tencent's interest - underscored by a financial commitment - speaks volumes about the promise of TSLA stock.Tesla Has Been StuckIn the sense that Tencent Holdings has its finger on a lot of technology pies, the news isn't shocking. Aside from WeChat (thefourth most popular messaging app in the world), the company operates popular online games such asLeague of Legends, is part owner of China's ride-hailing serviceDidi Chuxing, distributes digital music, maintains a microblogging platform, and iswading deep into artificial intelligence waters, among other things.9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a ShareTacking on a piece of Tesla doesn't make Tencent noticeably more jumbled than it already is.Nevertheless, if nothing else, the big chunk of TSLA stock that Tencent recently acquired is something of a moral victory for a company that has struggled to keep investors interested. The current price of $270 is roughly where Tesla shares were trading in the third quarter of 2014.Indeed, the stock has yet to retest its September-2014 peak of $291, even though it is arguably more investment-worthy now than it has ever been at any point in its history.The mid-priced electric car, the Model 3, is set tobegin production later this year, and interest in its new solar shingles is reportedly significant - CEO Elon Musk thinks they'lleventually capture 5% of the nation's roofing market.Dilution Doesn't MatterThat said, Musk hasn't exactly done investors any favors by raising funds several times since that 2014 peak by issuing new debt, more TSLA stock or both. Over the course of the prior three years, Tesla has garnered $6.5 billion in funds that was either dilutive, or added liabilities to the balance sheet.Tesla raised another $1.15 billion this month, mostly via new debt, though it did sell another $250 million worth of common stock. Those funds were necessary to ramp up capacity for the large-scale production of the Model 3.But Tencent CEO Ma ""Pony Ma"" Huateng isn't deterred by the dilution, debt obligations and Musk's penchant for overestimating deliveries, commenting:""Elon Musk is the archetype for entrepreneurship, combining vision, ambition, and execution. Tesla is a global pioneer at the forefront of new technologies including electric vehicles, assisted driving, shared vehicles, digitizing real-world information, sustainable energy generation and scalable energy storage.""Given Tencent's history under Huateng, he knows what he's talking about when it comes to turning an idea into a revenue-bearing profit center. If he says electric cars, energy storage and electric cars are worth pursuing and that Musk is doing it well, then Musk is arguably barking up the right tree the right way.Bottom Line for TSLA StockA reason to take on a position in Tesla stock if you don't have one already? That kind of thinking might be a bit over the top; Huateng doesn't have access to any more information than anyone else does.Short the Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Super Story, THEN Reload LongOn the other hand, Huateng has made billions by being forward-thinking, and seeing - and seizing - opportunities before the average investor does. Perhaps he has noticed thatIndia's solar market is about to explode, or understands just how much of an impactChina's support for electric vehiclescould have on Tesla's bottom line.In that light, Tencent's new stake in TSLA stock could be interpreted as something of a pseudo-endorsement from a guy who knows what he's talking about.Just bear in mind that it wasn't technically Huateng's money, and that TCEHY can afford to wait a long time for the investment pan out. Not every regular investor can do that.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFacebook Inc (FB) Slams Snap Inc (SNAP) With Facebook StoriesApple Inc.

Buy GoPro Inc (GPRO) While the Chips Are Down;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNowadays,GoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) doesn't seem able to catch a proper break. Good tidings for the beleaguered camera manufacturer have been few and far between ever since GPRO botched up the launch of Hero4.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)That's why investors have been celebrating afterGPRO reaffirmed first-quarter revenue, a move that helped GoPro stock break its freefall - at least for the time being. GPRO racked up 15% gains after it reaffirmed that first-quarter revenue will come in at the high-end of its $190 million-$210 million guidance.GoPro also said that it expects to boost the bottom line through program cost reduction and headcount cuts.Boosting the Bottom LineGPRO stock is beginning to show signs of cooling off, and the rally could be on its last legs. Investors can be forgiven for feeling jittery about a stock that has gone through a series of false starts that are more often than not followed by a protracted selloff.After all, it's not like GoPro just announced an exciting new product or anything like that. GPRO simply said that it plans to go ahead with the termination of roughly 270 positions and take a $10 million restructuring-associated charge in the process. In other words, GoPro will take a short-term hit on its bottom line, but could realize significant cost savings in the long-run.The 10 Best ETFs to Buy for the Rest of 2017That will mark the third round of job cuts by GoPro since 2016 as the action camera maker desperately tries to claw its way back to profitability. An announcement in January saw the company lay off 7% of its workers. The other round, which came in November 2016, was particularly severe - the company completely shuttered its entertainment division, losing 15% of its workforce in the process, and even lost company president and formerSkypehead Tony Bates.But all that seemed to do little good - GoPro still finished the year with a massive $373 million operating loss.Another False Start By GPRO?The investing universe seems to have lost faith in the ability of GoPro's management to get its act together. And that's saying a lot for a company that has yet to celebrate its third anniversary as a public entity. How did we get here?First off, GoPro was forced to cut the price of its iconic Hero4 camera in half just a few months after its launch. GPRO then promised to lose its tag as a one-trick pony by launching the Karma drone. But here again the company just couldn't get its game going. After delaying Karma for months, the company issued an embarrassing recall of the drone shortly after launch.According to CEO Nick Woodman:""We're a little bit embarrassed that it was something as basic as a battery retention issue.""Investors could not help but feel that GoPro's management was constantly being blindsided by events, and that's never a good thing. That's the reason whyKarma's recent relaunchdid nothing for GPRO stock.GoPro said during the second launch that shipments would be limited at first, which defies logic for a product that has been so long in development. Karma returned to the shelves on Feb 1, 2017 but eight days later GoPro stock had tanked 23%.But maybe this could finally be the right time to pick up the shares when the chips are still down. For all its woes, GoPro is still selling cameras, with many of its products regarded as the best in class. GoPro's new Hero5 and Hero5 Session have proven to be something of a hit - the company sold 2 million cameras during the fourth quarter, the second-highest figure in any quarter. Those impressive sales helped GoPro snap out of a revenue tailspin that stretched back four quarters.The midpoint of GoPro's first-quarter guidance points to revenue growth of 9%. That's not exactly earth-shattering, but it will lay a foundation for further improvements down the road.Yes, Tencent's Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stake Is a BIG Buy SignalGoPro has promised the next iteration of its action cameras, Hero6, will hit the markets sometime this year. The company has also said that Karma will be available in international markets later this spring. This makes GPRO stock a good turnaround bet.Bottom Line on GoPro StockIt's hard to tell whether GPRO has finally found a floor after losing a third of its value over the past six months. The stock is trading slightly above its all-time low, and may remain range-bound for some time until another solid catalyst emerges. But I'm willing to wager that this is not another false start by GoPro stock.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your Portfolio9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a ShareThe postBuy GoPro Inc (GPRO) While the Chips Are Downappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Rockets to New All-Time Highs;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUpdates with UBS upgrade, AAPL close.makeArticleAd();Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares finished Tuesday with a new all-time closing high of $143.80, closing just off its intraday high of $144.04 to finish off a 2%-plus gain alongside the broader-market recovery. That also extended a now 23%-plus run in AAPL stock since the start of 2017.But what exactly is causing the sudden renewed push higher in Apple shares? It looks like a combination of analyst optimism and a few other factors.The Big Apple Update No One's Talking AboutThe newest news on Tuesday was Apple's relatively muted update to iPhones and iPads to the ""Apple File System"" - an upgrade to the way Apple devices stored data, which previously was HFS+. Per Apple:""Apple File System is a new, modern file system for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It is optimized for Flash/SSD storage and features strong encryption, copy-on-write metadata, space sharing, cloning for files and directories, snapshots, fast directory sizing, atomic safe-save primitives, and improved file system fundamentals.""It's an important upgrade considering that the Hierarchial File System (HFS), and its upgrade, HFS+, has been in use for more than three decades. The Apple File System should result in faster read and write speeds across Apple's devices.It's nice … but it's also an unlikely driver for AAPL stock.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterInstead, Apple is enjoying a combination of a swing in positive market sentiment, recent upgrades, optimism and the 10th anniversary iPhone.AAPL Stock UpgradesApple received a glowing recommendation from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich on Tuesday, who said AAPL shares could hit $200, though it would take a perfect storm including establishing ""new product categories"" and buybacks of more than $50 billion per year. UBS believes iPhone revenues will grow by double digits next year, then high single digits in fiscal 2019.That continued the momentum from other positive analyst notes of late.Apple received a price-target upgrade from JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall on Sunday, from $142 to $165 (16% upside from here), citing high replacement demand for the upcoming iPhone. He upgraded his estimate for unit sales in fiscal 2018, from 245 million to 260 million, expecting a 48% replacement rate.He also expects Apple to include a high-powered ""iPhone Pro"" that will go for about $1,000.Last week, Nomura Instinet's Jeffrey Kvaal also raised his price target on Apple stock, also to $165 per share, up from $135. He too believes the upcoming iPhone cycle is going to be much more robust than the current Wall Street estimate, pointing out that while there were 400 million iPhones in use ahead of the iPhone 6 cycle, there will be roughly 665 million by the time the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition, or countless other potential names) comes live.The market is also broadly excited for the iPhone 8 just because of the laundry list of potential options that have been floated out there. Among the potential features?Wireless chargingAdvanced biometric featuresScanning technologyNew Touch ID technologyOLED display (5.8 inches for the base model, 5.15 inches of usable space)Water resistanceUpdated A11 processorGlass bodyUSB-C port to replace Lightning connectorNo home buttonOf course, some of the features are more grounded in reality than others.Friendly Chart, Friendly MarketApple shares also are the beneficiary of a healthy-looking chart.Apple Inc. Watch Series 3 Could Cut the CordDespite broadly rising prices, Apple also has managed to work off overbought levels in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) over the past two months. That comes at the same time that Apple, while setting a continuous string of new highs since February, has killed any sort of overhead price resistance.In other words, technically speaking, the sky's the limit.AAPL stock is also moving along with the current - theDow Jones Industrial Average(of which Apple is a component) is up nearly half a percent on Tuesday, and well on its way toward snappingan eight-day losing streak. TheS&P 500is also up fractionally, as is theNasdaq Composite.The flip side? Apple also has been carried down of late along with the major indices, so soured sentiment would be likely to pull AAPL back from its new peaks.Past that, iPhone 8 rumors will carry (or sink) the stock for the next few months.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFacebook Inc (FB) Slams Snap Inc (SNAP) With Facebook StoriesYes, Tencent's Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stake Is a BIG Buy SignalThe 10 Best ETFs to Buy for the Rest of 2017The postApple Inc.

Tesla Inc. Stock Rises After Tencent Reveals 5% Stake;3/28/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock, adding to its more than 11% jump in the   past five days, is up about 3% Tuesday morning. Today's rise   follows a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission   revealing a new 5% stake in the electric-car maker by Chinese   internet companyTencent Holdings(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) .Tencent's 5% stake in TeslaIn a 13G filing with the SEC on Tuesday, Tencent and Tesla   revealed the former now has a 5% stake in Tesla, owning about 8.2   million shares of the company.Tesla vehicles. Image source: AuthormakeArticleAd();Tencent paid about $1.8 billion for the shares, including   commissions, the filing said. But the total position is already   worth about $2.3 billion as of Tesla's stock price on   Tuesday. Tencent provided a statement about the position toBloomberg:Elon Musk is the archetype for entrepreneurship, combining     vision, ambition, and execution. Tesla is a global pioneer at     the forefront of new technologies including electric vehicles,     assisted driving, shared vehicles, digitizing real-world     information, sustainable energy generation and scalable energy     storage.The large position in Tesla makes Tencent Tesla's   fifth-largest shareholder.What does Tencent do?Tencent is primarily known for its popular messaging app,   WeChat, and its significant share of mobile game sales in   China.Launched in 2011, Tencent's WeChat boasts an impressive 889   million monthly active users, making it the No. 1 smartphone   community in China. Notably, the platform is still growing   rapidly. Its 889 million monthly active users were up 28% year   over year in the company's most recent quarter. And Tencent is   replicating its success with its instant messaging service QQ,   which has garnered 652 million monthly active users on mobile and   868 million when including PCs.In addition, with the help of its social networking reach,   Tencent maintains a dominant position in gaming distribution,   making it China's biggest gaming company.Tencent has also recently invested aggressively in mobile   payments and cloud services, opening the door to new monetization   streams.Tesla vehicle. Image source: Author.Interestingly, Tencent has recently been stepping up its   investment in artificial intelligence (AI), building a team of   more than 250 people to work on it. Possibly serving as one of   the reasons for Tencent's investment in Tesla, Tencent CEO Ma   Huateng recently said the company was interested in exploring AI   technology as it relates to driverless cars. Tesla is arguably   pursuing driverless cars more aggressively than any other company   in the world. As of October last year, Tesla started including   the hardware necessary for autonomous driving in every vehicle it   makes. The company also plans to include similar hardware in its   upcoming lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3.While Tencent's 5% stake doesn't impact Tesla's intrinsic   value, it does highlight a key vote of confidence in Tesla by a   major company in China with an excellent track record of   execution and investment.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc (FB) Slams Snap Inc (SNAP) With Facebook Stories;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is keeping up its unrelenting game of copycat againstSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) by unfurling a fourth feature derived from the popular Snapchat app.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFacebook will introduce ""Facebook Stories,"" which will allow you to share photos and videos that will vanish after 24 hours. In response, SNAP stock sold off by roughly 5% in Tuesday's morning trade.Again, this marks the fourth time Facebook has ripped something straight from the pages of Snapchat, though it's the first time the ""stolen"" feature has gone smack-dab on the primary Facebook app.Here, we'll take a closer look at Facebook Stories, and the other ways FB has copied rival SNAP.Facebook StoriesFacebook,in its release, ironically mentions the Instagram community as inspiration for this feature, saying it has ""shown us that it can be fun to share things that disappear after a day.""But those familiar with Snapchat know that this is a long-time feature on that social app, and even Facebook project manager Conor Hayes admits as much.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right Now""This is something that Snapchat has really pioneered,"" Hayes toldBloomberg. ""Stories has become a format for people to share and consume immersive video and photo across all social apps, and it really differs for them based on the network they have or the way that they use a certain app.""Reports that FB was working on such a featurecame out back in January.Facebook Stories will also include a ""Direct"" feature, which will let friends view videos or photos once - they can then either replay it or write a reply. ""Once the conversation on the photo or video ends, the content is no longer visible in Direct,"" Facebook says.The launch comes amid Facebook's announcement that it's rolling out a new camera replete with additional effects including masks, frames and filters, ""letting you turn your everyday selfie into a Picasso-style work of art.""Instagram StoriesThis isn't even the first time Facebook has copied the vanishing-photo feature, of course. In 2016, Facebook unleashed ""Stories"" on its Instagram app, which quickly reached 150 million daily users.The move was heralded as Facebook's ""next step,"" accenting the importance of video to Facebook's collection of apps. The feature works much the same way:""Stories let you share a series of videos or photos - and have them disappear after 24 hours. You'll see stories from the people you follow at the top of your feed, and a ring around their profile picture tells you when their story has been updated.""Months after the launch, several reports showed thatInstagram Stories appeared to be stealing Snapchat's users, with decline counts ranging anywhere from 15% to 40%.WhatsApp StatusEarlier this year, Facebook-owned WhatsApp launched a feature that might sound familiar:WhatsApp Status, which allows users to share images, GIFs and videos with their contacts for 24 hours before they disappear.The impetus behind the change was to spark a large number of users to interact with the app more, as manysimply use default statuses and walk away.Facebook Messenger DayJust earlier this month, Facebook launched ""Messenger Day,"" which is pretty similar to Stories in that it allows people to post photos and videos on its Messenger app before they erase themselves … after a day. The photos can be adorned with drawings and other filters, and can be shared with anyone on your Messenger list.Instagram GeostickersInstagram also was updated this year to include ""Geostickers,"" which allow you to add various images and illustrations to Stories posts that are connected to wherever you are at the moment.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Gears Up for WarThis is a mimic of theSnapchat ""Geofilters"" featurethat allows people to send city-specific ""stickers"" on top of images in their messages and snaps. That feature originally rolled out in big cities including New York City, Los Angeles, Sydney and Paris, whereas Instagram's Geostickers started with a launch in just NYC and Jakarta.Facebook PokeBack in 2012, Facebook launched a mobile app called ""Poke"" that also was meant to imitate Snapchat, allowing users to send images and videos that would disappear within seconds.While the apps were very similar in nature, and while Poke even had a few important differences including location service and longer messages, Poke ended up being a massive flop.At the time, Facebook was criticized for its blatant theft, but still managed to get a quick amount of buzz on its launch. However, it quickly dropped in popularity and fell down the rankings of the iTunes store.Clearly, though, that never served as a warning not to copy Snapchat again … and as the continuing success of Facebook's Snapchat clones indicates, that might be for the best.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Tesla Taking Solar Roof Orders in April: What We Know and What We Don't;3/27/2017;"WhenTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) solar roof was announced in November, Elon Musk   took the solar industry by surprise. The roof is elegant and   almost hidden on a home, a design goal that's been elusive to   solar manufacturers. Tesla's shingle design is a concept that at   least a half dozen companies have tried before -- and failed at   -- and Musk said he could make it for the same price as a   ""regular roof.""After a short presentation showing off the product, Musk   walked off stage, and we haven't heard much in the way of details   about what the solar roof will be. Now, Musk says orders will   start in April. Here's what we know, what we don't know, and what   investors should look for when details are announced.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Here's what we knowWe know that the solar roof is a glass shingle with a solar   cell in it. And the few glimpses we've seen indicate that the   solar roof is a great-looking product. We also know that Musk   says orders will start in April.And that concludes what we know about the product. Seriously   -- that's it.What we don't knowWhat we don't know about the solar roof is far more   consequential for Tesla's new product.Musk says the solar roof will be priced similarly to a     regular roof, but what he means by ""regular roof"" hasn't been     defined. And unless he's referring to the most expensive roof     options, like ceramic or concrete tiles, it's hard to see how     his projected pricing could be possible. I did the calculations     a few months ago, and cells alone arefar more expensive than asphalt shingles, so it's hard to even pencil out how the roof could be     cost-effective. Cost is a big unknown.We know absolutely nothing about how the solar roof will be     installed and connected to an inverter. Based on what we've     seen so far, each cell will need to be connected to its     neighboring cell and eventually to an inverter. How exactly     will that work?It's also not known who will install the solar roof. There     would presumably be very little volume early on, so SolarCity's     installation infrastructure could be used, but the product may     also be sold through a traditional roofing network, where roof     replacements with a solar roof might make sense. Musk needs to     expand on the channel plan.When the solar roof was introduced, it was obvious that the     roofs used to display the product had been completely rebuilt     for the solar roof. We don't know what kind of angle and space     limitations roofs will have, so we don't even know how many     roofs could potentially take a solar roof.There's still uncertainty about when the solar roof will be     available. SolarCity's Buffalo, New York, manufacturing plant     is supposed to be where the cells and roof shingles will be     made, but we haven't seen the facility produce a reliable     traditional solar cell, much less a revolutionary solar     product.There's a reasonSunPowerCEO Tom Werner said he was ""skeptical"" about the solar roof. Musk   and Tesla are trying to create a solar product that many others   with more manufacturing experience have failed at. And there are   a lot of dots that need to be connected before customers will be   able to put the Tesla solar roof on their roofs.What investors should watch and expectAnyone expecting a solar roof to cost anything near a   traditional asphalt roof will be disappointed when details are   released. At best, investors should expect that a solar roof   product will cost a customer over $15,000; an all-in price over   $30,000 wouldn't surprise me. The roof may also generate less   energy than traditional solar panels would, given the design.Some challenges with installation could be answered with a   limited launch, likely in solar-dense areas in California. And   Tesla will presumably design the product in a way that will allow   it to be installed on many kinds of roofs.Investors' highest expectations should be that Tesla could   make the solar roof a highly profitable niche product for the   high end of the roofing and solar market. Trying to make it a   mass-market product could end in disaster unless it's extremely   low-cost (which I've highlighted is unlikely). The solar roof   could be a good product for Tesla, but the company shouldn't be   betting big on an untested product with untested manufacturing.   Until we know more, I'll take a skeptical approach to the product   as well.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. (APOP) Stock Is Soaring Today;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCellect Biotechnology Ltd.(NASDAQ:APOP) is up 74% to start the week after the little-known biotech completed its first stem cell transplant in Phase I/II trial. Today's gains give APOP stock an astounding - though not uncommon for biotech - 260% year-to-date gain.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockCellect Biotechnology was founded just a handful of years ago, in 2011, with the intent of legitimizing the use of regenerative medicine. If Cellect succeeds in its mission, it would position itself as the main provider of stem cell treatments and technologies for the Big Pharma industry. That's not exactly small potatoes.Essentially, the now-risky process of stem cell treatments would become""a trivial, safe and inexpensive process.""Investors caught a glimpse of that future today and bid APOP stock up accordingly.Cellect's Stem Cell SuccessThe transplant procedure was accomplished using Cellect's proprietary ApoGraft technology in a blood cancer patient.3 Biotech Stocks That Could Double OvernightUsually, stem cell bone marrow transplants have a 50-50 risk of causing graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD), which is when a donor's immune cells attack the patient's healthy, normal cells, which can be life threatening.Cellect CEO Dr. Shai Yarkoni hadthis to say:""After 15 years of research, this is the first time we have used our technology on a cancer patient suffering from life-threatening conditions. It is a first good step on a road that we hope will lead to stem cell based regenerative medicine becoming a safe commodity treatment at every hospital in the world.""The success of Cellect's stem cell transplant has led the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board to approve two additional patient enrollments into the company's ApoGraft treatment program.Bottom Line on APOP StockUnlike many other once-hot biotechs, Cellect shares have retained their gains throughout the life of APOP - up 125% since going public in July 2016. That's not to say it hasn't had its fair share of peaks and troughs, however, as APOP stock saw an intraday low of $2.30, and is off of its high of $13.50. Today's trading volume of 7.3 million compares to an average of 165,000, however, suggesting the spotlight is now on Cellect Biotechnology.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Solar Roof Tiles to Go on Sale in AprilIndeed, investors are applauding in droves Cellect's first successful stem cell transplant. That's because the global market for stem cells will growfrom $12 billion in 2016 to $26.6 billion by 2021, with regenerative medicine as its major application. All eyes will be on Cellect's second stem cell trial, as well as the success (or failure) of its competitors.As it is, it's too early to tell whether APOP stock will continue to hold its gains, or give it all back in one explosive misstep.As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second Quarter7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioTesla Inc (TSLA) Solar Roof Tiles to Go on Sale in AprilThe postWhy Cellect Biotechnology Ltd.

Tesla's Latest Challenge: An Oversupplied Battery Market;3/27/2017;"WhenTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) began construction on its $5 billion Gigafactory   in Nevada, a lot of company observers saw it as a bold but wise   move. At worst, if demand for electric vehicles and energy   storage didn't shape up as projected, the company would be able   tosell batteries to cellphone manufacturers.As the Model 3 nears its launch date, the Gigafactory is   ramping up production to meet demand for the 500,000 vehicles   Tesla plans on making next year. At the same time, Tesla's   success in EVs and the growth of energy storage haven't gone   unnoticed by competitors. Companies around the world are building   out battery capacity to fill the needs of automakers and energy   storage developers alike. And rising capacity is driving   overcapacity, leading to lower battery prices. If the trend   continues, competitors will be able to ride the industry's   commodity prices while Tesla will have to contend with the   falling value of batteries coming out of the Gigafactory. Here's   why that's a challenge in the long term.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();How the battery industry became oversuppliedWhen Tesla began building the Gigafactory, it was expected to   nearly double the world's battery production when it opened. And   if Elon Musk was going to make 500,000 EVs per year, he needed to   make a bet that big on batteries.But since then, lots of competitors have begun expanding   battery capacity.BYD, AESC (owned by Nissan and NEC),LG Chem,Samsung, and other Asian suppliers are building out their own capacity   in an effort to capture market share. And while capacity is   opaque, there are indications that there will be more than enough   supply for everyone. Sources I've talked to say that finding   supply is the least of their worries, and prices on the open   market are below $300 per kWh and falling. Costs are expected to   fall further as oversupply hits the market, with manufacturers   likely to sell near their own cash costs just to gain market   share. One sign that batteries aren't a business that's very   attractive is that Nissan has decided to sell its stake in AESC,   having decided it's a better idea to buy batteries on the open   market. Through its partnership with Panasonic and the   Gigafactory buildout, Tesla is moving in the opposite   direction.Tesla Powerpacks installed in California. Image source:     Author.On the demand side, EVs haven't taken hold as fast as many had   predicted. In 2008, President Obama said he wanted 1 million EVs   on the road by 2015. We might not hit that level in the U.S.   until 2020. Even Tesla, for all its success, has repeatedly   missed its own production and sales targets. That trend could   change, but companies are investing in new battery capacity for   projected demand for EVs and energy storage. For now, a   combination of slower-than-hoped-for growth in EV demand and a   boom in battery supply will leave the market oversupplied with   batteries for the foreseeable future.There's a parallel to solar energyThere's no question that the EV industry is growing, and so is   energy storage, so there is some good news. But how quickly   demand and capacity grow can tell us a lot about how companies   will perform financially. If the market is undersupplied, you   want to have some captive supply of batteries to meet your   customers' needs. But if it's oversupplied, you want to buy   product that manufacturers are dumping on the market at low   costs. And buying batteries on the open market can save billions   in capital costs to build capacity, too.This same dynamic happened in the solar industry a decade ago   and in some ways continues today. Everyone gets excited about the   growth of the solar industry, so suppliers build as much capacity   as they can. But demand doesn't grow as quickly as supply, and   thus the market becomes oversupplied. Panel prices fall, making   the product less valuable. Technology improves and the cost   structure of new manufacturing gets better, and the cycle begins   again.Five to 10 years after solar plants were completed,most of them were obsolete. You can see the financial devastation in former global capacity   leadersSuntech PowerandQ-Cellsgoing bankrupt and in the more recent collapse ofYingli Green Energy. The solar companies who have done well weren't panel   manufacturers, they were companies buying solar panels from   commodity suppliers and riding the falling commodity prices in   the industry.The supply of batteries doesn't appear to be the     problemWhen Tesla decided to build the Gigafactory, it did so because   it needed to ensure battery supplies for its massive EV and   energy storage growth plans. Today, the market appears to be   flush with batteries, and competitors can buy them on the open   market at costs similar to Tesla's manufacturing costs   without the headache of actually building a battery plant. Some   are even buying batteries directly from Tesla, which is reporting   gross margins in energy in thelow single digits.Tesla is going to need to keep producing batteries at or below   the cost of competitors' or risk being at a competitive   disadvantage. Given the similarities between the battery market   today and the solar industry a decade ago, and the fact that   building massive manufacturing capacity was the surest sign of   future financial trouble in solar, investors need to watch   closely how Tesla executes its battery strategy. Building out   capacity can seem like a good idea, but not if that leaves you   captive to older technology when competitors are buying better   technology for less.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Monday’s Vital Data: Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are falling sharply this morning, as the Trump-trade is finally beginning to unwind. With the failure of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal last week, Wall Street is beginning to have serious doubts about President Donald Trump's ability to push through his more ambitious campaign promises, such as corporate tax cuts and deregulation.makeArticleAd();The major market indices are in full retreat this morning, with futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagedown 0.64%, of 132 points, whileS&P 500futures have plunged 0.79% andNasdaq-100futures have ripped 0.71% lower so far.On the options front, volume arrived just above average on Friday, with about 15.3 million calls and 16.7 million puts changing hands, as put volume gained favor ahead of the weekend. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio came in at 0.69, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.67.Driving Friday's options volume,Micron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU) drew heavy call volume after the company posted stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Meanwhile,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) saw divided options activity Friday, but could see a lift in calls today following a Vetr upgrade. Finally,Tesla Inc's(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted about everything under the sun on Friday, including a new Model 3 video, the new Model Y, and Tesla's new solar roof.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)Semiconductor stocks have been hot recently, and Micron solidified its position in the marketplace with itssecond-quarter report on Thursday evening.7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioMicron said it earned 90 cents per share on revenue of $4.65 billion, topping expectations for 80 cents per share on sales of $4.6 billion. MU stock roared nearly 7.5% higher on the news, flirting with round-number resistance near $30 on Friday.As a result, MU options traders flooded the shares with call activity. Total volume rose to 1.1 million contracts - a near-term high for the shares - while calls snapped up 76% of the day's take. Looking out to the April series, the put/call open interest ratio has fallen to a perch of 0.62, as calls are added at a faster rate than puts for options set to expire within the next month. Peak call OI for the series currently numbers roughly 56,000 contracts at the deep in-the-money $25 strike, though OI is building at the $30 strike, where more than 20,000 contracts now reside.Apple Inc. (AAPL)AAPL stock finally battled its way north of resistance at $140 late last week, but short-term traders hold little faith that the shares will maintain this perch for long. Options activity on Friday was mixed, with calls only accounting for 55% of the 914,000 contracts traded on AAPL stock.Meanwhile, AAPL is trading lower this morning, dipping back below $140 in premarket activity despite anupgrade to ""buy"" from ""hold"" at Vetr. Market headwinds could play a role in keeping AAPL stock's upside limited, especially if an unwinding of the Trump-trade gains momentum in the wake of last week's failed health-care vote.Short-term options traders are certainly aware of the risk, as the April put/call OI ratio of 0.90 indicates that puts are gaining traction against calls. Peak call OI of 88,000 contracts currently rests at the April $140 strike, while peak put OI for the series totals 63,000 contracts at the same strike.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Tesla's Elon Musk stirred up considerable activity on Friday following anearly morning tweet storm. The TSLA CEO said that the much-talked about Model Y was not arriving within the next year, but that it was certainly in the pipeline and that Tesla needed to focus on the Model 3 first. Musk also released a video of the Model 3 and said that the company would begin taking orders for its solar roof next month.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is a High-Risk All-StarDespite quite a bit of positive momentum from Musk's comments - TSLA added roughly 3.3% on the day - options traders remained reserved. Volume passed 367,000 contracts on Friday, with puts taking the lead by snapping up 51% of the day's take.Heavy put activity is nothing new to TSLA stock, however, as the shares currently sport an April put/call OI ratio of 1.41. Traders should keep an eye on the $260 level amid today's broad-market selling pressure, as a close north of this technical level could have bullish implications for TSLA stock.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Dividend Stocks to Build a Solid Growth Portfolio9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a ShareThe postMonday's Vital Data: Micron Technology, Inc.

The Model 3 should not be thought of as the ""next version"" of Tesla, like Apple Inc.

3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Snap Inc (SNAP) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL);3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMonday could see the stock markets mired in red ink again as global and domestic traders alike continue to digest not just the failure of House Republicans to push their first major bill - healthcare reform - forward, but also an unrelenting current of new developments in the ongoing investigation between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.makeArticleAd();This morning, the spotlight moves toApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which have some new analyst optimism to boast, as well asUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL) … which right now likely wishes it could duck back into the shadows.Here's what you need to know heading into Monday's trading:Apple Inc. (AAPL)Apple is on the receiving end of a pair of wins - one on the analyst front, and one in the courts.JPMorgan Chase, which already has an ""Overweight"" rating on AAPL stock, raised its price target from $142 to $165, implying roughly 18% upside from current prices. The catalyst? JPMorgan sees high pent-up replacement demand at the same time Apple is gearing up to launch a 10th-anniversary iPhone.9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a ShareFrom analyst Rod Hall:""Our F2018 unit forecast moves up to 260m units from our prior 245m estimate. We also take a detailed look at OLED supply to Apple and conclude that this should not be a limiting factor but probably will keep Apple from making two OLED models. Multiple iPhone ""Pro"" features including 3D facial scanning, a glass heavy design, and a structured-light-enabled camera look likely to us and should drive users to upgrade phones that are older, on average, than they have been for four years.""JPMorgan also upped its earnings estimates on AAPL from to $11.74 per share in calendar year 2018.Also, over the weekend, a court overturned a 2016 ruling that said Apple violated patent designs of China's Shenzhen Baili - a now-defunct company that ""barely existed"" when it sued Apple over the design of its iPhone 6. While Apple faced an early injunction, it has been able to sell phones during the case, and thus the court victory, while encouraging, likely has no serious financial implications.AAPL shares still are threatening to open Monday's trading lower, along with the rest of the market.United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL )United Continental is in hot PR water after refusing to lettwo passengers on a plane.Two girls traveling from Denver to Minneapolis were wearing leggings when they were refused entry onto a plane. The incident itself was fairly calm, and a group behind the girls even offered clothes to help cover one of the girls to meet compliance.However, social media went ballistic when someone who witnessed the event tweeted it out.United's initial response was that the company ""shall have the right to refuse passengers who are not properly clothed,"" though later on, the airline updated its response to note that the policy had to do with a specific perks program.""The passengers this morning were United pass riders who were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel,"" United tweeted. The rules apply to anyone who receives free travel passes linked to employment with the company, whether it's employees themselves, or family or friends.Nonetheless, social media continued to bash the company for what many saw as discriminatory practices. Now, some think a quick backlash could send United customers - at least in the short-term - to other competitors.UAL shares are off slightly in Monday's trade.Snap Inc (SNAP)Lastly, SNAP shares are enjoying a flood of analyst coverage on Monday morning, most of which is optimistic.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model Y Rumors Excite Morgan StanleyCowen & Co. slapped an ""Outperform"" rating on SNAP stock with a price target of $26, or about 14% higher from current prices. Analyst John Blackledge is particularly optimistic about Snap's ability to monetize from here:""SNAP is a leading social / messaging service and we expect share upside based on ramping ad monetization, with SNAP's share of WW mobile ad (x-China) rising from 1% to 5% '17-'22E. SNAP should generate high incremental margins as it scales. SNAP is trading at 16x EV/Sales on our '18 estimates vs. 8x for FB. We initiate coverage with an Outperform and $26 PT.""Credit Suisse also chimed in with an ""Outperform"" rating and a $30 price target.The dissenter from the group was Oppneheimer's Jason Helfstein, which started Snap at ""Hold,"" but with a fairly sunny note not just about SNAP's upside, but what Snapchat could mean for the future of communication:""Today, mobile phones primarily perform peripheral tasks. Snapchat has begun to reorient the use-case of the mobile phone back toward communicating, using the camera. By doing so, Snapchat has blurred the lines between entertainment and communication. … While unsuccessful at garnering older users thus far, we believe Snapchat's mission of reintroducing emotional integrity to digital communication is a universally applicable use-case.""SNAP shares are up more than 3% in Monday's early trade as they try to reclaim post-IPO highs around $29 - some 28% higher from here.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second Quarter7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your Portfolio10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double This QuarterThe post3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Apple Inc.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model Y Rumors Excite Morgan Stanley;3/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is currently busy ramping up production for its mass-market Model 3 to meet massive consumer demand. The company has a challenging task of delivering 400,000 vehicles on schedule. But the rumor mill, consumers, and investors are already looking forward to the next-gen Model Y, which Elon Musk has talked about in the past.makeArticleAd();Model Y Will Be an Instant BlockbusterSource: ShutterstockModel Y will be a compact SUV based on thesame platformas Model 3. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in aresearch reportto investors that the futuristic compact SUV would become Tesla's highest selling model when it comes out. Jonas believes that the small SUV segment will eventually become the largest segment in the world, representing huge opportunities for TSLA.Model Y will feature falcon wing doors similar to Model X. Interestingly, falcon wing doors havereceived a mixed responsefrom consumers, with many arguing that it is merely an unnecessary addition to the vehicle and a nuisance. Arecent report from Autocar claimsthat Tesla would announce the compact SUV sometime in 2018 and bring it to the market by 2019.Why Tesla Should Speed Up the Model Y LaunchThere is a strong reason for Tesla to speed up Model Y launch. In September last year,we reportedthat demand for sedans was consistently declining as consumers preferred crossovers and SUVs. Most automobile companies are already investing to introduce more SUVs and crossovers. TSLA already has a crossover in the form of Model X, but it is not for the masses.9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a ShareModel Y, which will be much more affordable than Model X, could ride the crossover wave. It will reportedly cost around $37,000. But Tesla believes that actual price could go as high as $45,000 because most buyers often add optional features to their vehicles.Tesla's next-gen vehicle would come with fully autonomous driving capabilities. According toAutocar, Model Y will feature eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, a new forward-facing radar system, and a supercomputer that would process data 40 times faster than previously.Will Model Y Be the Backbone of Tesla Mobility?Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said Model Y would be ""at the center of an on-demand ride sharing service"" because of its modular seat configuration, larger passenger compartment, and luggage space. Elon Musk hastalkedabout anUber-like on demand ride-hailing service Tesla Mobility in the past. Tesla Mobility would include a large number of autonomous vehicles that would take you to your final destination rather than just to the nearest bus stop.Tesla Mobility could turn into a viable business. According totwo different studies, a hypothetical fleet of fully autonomous Model 3 could be ""highly profitable"" and would gain a significant chunk of ride-hailing market share. Though Model 3 and Model Y will have a similar price tag, Jonas argues that Y is more suitable for Tesla Mobility because of its design.Model 3 to Be 10 Times Safer Than an Average CarTalking about the upcoming Model 3, Morgan Stanley said the vehicle would come with some advanced hardware and software that would make it ten times safer than an average car. The analyst says such a significant spike in safety would boost Model 3 sales. If the Elon Musk-led company can demonstrate that level of safety, it would change the way the auto insurance industry works.Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Pulls a Model 3 Bait-and-SwitchTheresults of the federal investigationinto a deadly accident involving a Tesla car show that the Autopilot feature has made TSLA vehicles 40% safer than other cars. According to the NHTSA, crash rates of Tesla vehicles declined by nearly 40% after the company introduced Autosteer, a part of the Autopilot system. Morgan Stanley has aBuyrating on the stock with $305 price target.The next-gen Model Y is a key part of the California company's expansion plans. Elon Musk forecasts that it could sell between 500,000 and one million units per year. The EV maker that last year delivered only 76,000 vehicles plans to ramp up production to 500,000 by 2018 and one million cars by 2020.The postModel Y To Become Tesla's Top-Selling Vehicle: Morgan Stanleyappeared first onValueWalk.More From InvestorPlaceApple Buys Powerful Automation App WorkflowCount Out Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why Deere & Company (DE) Is Better Than Caterpillar Inc. (CAT);3/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the sector, two heavyweights that hog the limelight areCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) andDeere & Company(NYSE:DE) with market capitalizations of $54.21 billion and $33.5 billion, respectively. Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment and also dabbles in agricultural equipment. It falls under the Zacks categorizedManufacturing-Construction and Miningsub industry which is currently carrying a Rank of #59 (out of 265 industries we cover), being in the top 23%.makeArticleAd();TheIndustrial Productssector, is currently positively placed at 3 out of a total 16 sectors we cover (top 19%). Last year, the industrial machinery sector was one of the most adversely impacted industries in the U.S, reeling from the uncertainties in the global arena.This scenario can primarily be attributed to weak commodity prices, reduced investment in the energy sector as an aftermath of lower oil prices, poor economic conditions in some developed and developing nations, and Brexit. However, sentiment steadily improved thereafter, particularly following the victory of Donald Trump as investors anticipate his plans of big spending in infrastructure, and easing regulations for oil and coal exploration to help boost the industry.The sector delivered a 6.7% increase in earnings in the fourth quarter. As per ourprojections, the sector will log a growth of 5.4% in first-quarter 2017. In the quarters ahead, governmental policies encouraging better trade relations, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will sustain growth for industrial machinery stocks. Until such improvements materialize, stocks with high investment rankings might interest investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.5 Dividend Stocks to Build a Solid Growth PortfolioDeere is the one world's foremost producers of agricultural equipment as well as a leading manufacturer of construction, forestry, and commercial and consumer equipment. It falls under the Zacks CategorizedManufacturing-Farm Equipmentsub industry which is currently carrying a Rank of #105 (out of 265 industries we cover), being in the top 41%.Investors keen on this sector would be inquisitive about which one has the more attractive prospects. Let's look more closely at how Caterpillar and Deere fare on some key metrics to see which stock deserves to be a part of your portfolio.Stock PerformanceDE has gained 36.5% in the past year, outperforming CAT's gain of 22.5% in the same time frame. While Deere has outpaced the Zacks categorized Machinery industry's gain of 24.9%, Caterpillar has lagged the same. However, both have performed better than the Industrial Product sector's rise of 19.8%.ValuationFrom a valuation perspective, the Caterpillar stock, which is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 26.81, is more expensive than the Deere stock which is trading a multiple of 23.71. Caterpillar is also expensive when compared with the industry multiple of 24.28, while the Deere Stock is cheaper.Zacks RankCAT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While, DE sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-Term Growth ExpectationsIn terms of long-term earnings growth expectations, Caterpillar scores above Deere with a projection of 9.50% compared with the latter's 7.58%.Dividend YieldFor income investors, Caterpillar has a higher dividend yield (3.33%) than Deere (2.19%).Earnings BeatDespite weak demand, both the companies have managed to beat estimates of late owing to cost cutting efforts. Caterpillar beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three the trailing four quarters, while coming in line in one quarter, with average earnings beat of 13.65%. Deere also has an impressive track record, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 60.50%.Estimate Revisions TrendFor fiscal 2017, CAT has witnessed, four downward estimate revisions with five upward movements in the last 60 days. For fiscal 2018, there have been three downward and three upward revisions in the same time frame. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has edged up 1% to $3.24 while the estimate for fiscal 2017 has remained at $4.20 over the last 60 days.While DE has observed eleven estimates move north for fiscal 2017 in the last 60 days with no downward movement. For fiscal 2018, seven estimates have been revised upward. Over the said timeframe, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Deere has moved up 4% to $4.76 for fiscal 2017 and for fiscal 2018, the estimate has moved up 4% to $5.47.Results & Growth ProspectsCaterpillar's continues to be affected by lower end-user demand. While commodity prices have improved from recent lows, it is not clear whether it is sufficient to drive increased demand for mining equipment. Meanwhile, despite a weak global agricultural sector, Deere continues to perform well driven by ongoing success of developing a more durable business model and wider range of revenue sources.Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Pulls a Model 3 Bait-and-SwitchFor both companies, improvement in construction and cost cutting are the keys to stay profitable. The construction industry has now entered a more mature phase of expansion, and construction spending can be anticipated to see moderate gains through 2017 and beyond.Lately, both the companies' share price has benefited from the victory of Donald Trump as investors expect his plans of big spending in infrastructure to help boost revenues. Further, investors appreciate the companies determined efforts to cut costs that will lead to margin expansion as revenues improve under President Trump.However, CAT is currently facing a federal probe regarding export filings related to its Swiss subsidiary CSARL. If the allegations are proved true, it will negatively impact the company. Thus it remains an overhang on the stock.DE Beats CATGoing by the above discussion, it can be said that DE stock stands out as a better investment proposition compared with Caterpillar at this moment. With a favorable Zacks Rank and positive estimate revisions, the scale is tipped in Deere's favor. Further, solid price movement ahead of the industry and cheaper valuation also make Deere a better bet.Other Stocks to ConsiderApart from Deere, investors interested in the industrial products sector may also consider ACCO Brands Corporation (NASDAQ:ACCO) andII-VI, Inc.(NASDAQ:IIVI). ACCO Brands has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 24.74% in the trailing four quarters. Both the companies sport the same rank as Deere. II-VI Incorporated has an average positive earnings surprise of 59.23%  in the preceding four quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Can Tesla and Uber Learn from Ford's Mistake?;3/25/2017;"Two of the most polarizing companies in recent years areTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Uber. The two, in their own respective ways, have flipped the automotive industry on its head, and, along with other technology companies, have set the industry on a path to evolve wildly over the next two decades. Uber was a wake up call to major automakers, such asFord Motor Company(NYSE: F) , on ways to expand its top line without a traditional vehicle sale. And Tesla showed automakers electric vehicles are a viable business if you develop a strong product and brand.However, what is becoming clear is that Tesla and Uber have something important they can learn from Ford: Corporate culture matters.makeArticleAd();Tesla's upcoming Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.What's going on?Uber's public relations team has put in some work lately with multiple stories regarding company executives and treatment of employees. Here's a snippet from Susan Fowler's blog post, a former Uber employee, about her time there and the culture she witnessed.I remember countless meetings with my managers and skip-levels where I would sit there, not saying anything, and the manager would be boasting about finding favor with their skip-level and that I should expect them to have their manager's job within a quarter or two. I also remember a very disturbing team meeting in which one of the directors boasted to our team that he had withheld business-critical information from one of the executives so that he could curry favor with one of the other executives (and, he told us with a smile on his face, it worked!).""Also within Susan's post are allegations ofsexual harassment and apathy from HRregarding the allegations. There's also a video of Uber CEO Travis Kalanickberating an Uber driver earlier this year. Just recently, respected Uber President Jeff Jones quit his position after only six months at the company because the controversiesaren't what he signed up for.Meanwhile, Tesla is having issues of its own. The promising electric vehicle automaker has witnessed a string of executive departures over the past year, which is far from ideal as the company inches toward the launch of the company's incredibly important Model 3. Former Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler's recent departure is only the latest of defects and many others have cited long hours, difficult production goals, and a tense culture fostered by the company's brilliant, but demanding, CEO, Elon Musk.""Any time you're going through a big change it's important to have consistent management,"" Colin Langan, a UBS analyst, told Bloomberg. ""Jason Wheeler was a big hire and he's leaving, and there have been many other departures. If you're putting out aggressive targets and the people aren't there to meet them, it's a problem.""A trip down memory laneLet's rewind a second, as many investors have forgotten how broken Ford's culture was in decades past. Ford was notorious for its toxic culture with executives putting their own advancement above their own departments and company as a whole. It created a culture of backstabbing, undermining, and anything but working together for the greater good.Left: Alan Mulally. Middle: Bill Ford. Right: Mark Fields. Image source: Ford Motor Company.The result was a cutthroat, careerist culture that didn't produce results and culminated in a company that had failed product designs, failed business strategies, and little leadership. Its stock price was declining, its debt was junk rated, and it was about to get much worse as the looming Great Recession was just around the corner.In 2006, Alan Mulally, a former star executive at Boeing, took over the struggling Detroit automaker and pulled off a miracle getting the automaker through the Great Recession without taxpayer money. Mulally and his team fostered a culture that encouraged teamwork, consolidated and simplified the company's strategies, and produced vehicles people actually wanted to buy. It was a wildly successful turnaround and the cornerstone of its success was driven by Mulally fixing the toxic culture -- and that might be the most important thing Tesla and Uber can learn from an automaker that's been in business since 1903. I'm not saying the CEO's need to go, quite the opposite, they need to take a page out of Mulally's book and fix the culture they started.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Used Car Is Worth More Now Than When New;3/25/2017;"Demand forHarley-Davidson(NYSE: HOG) motorcycles used to be so great that a used bike   could be sold for as much or more than the price paid for it.   Waiting lists to buy new motorcycles ran months long until Harley   went into overdrive producing enough bikes to meet demand.You're usually not going to find a comparable situation in   production-model cars and trucks. Their ubiquity makes them, if   not a dime a dozen, certainly less valuable over time. That's   partially the reason a car's value drops so sharply once you   drive it off the dealer's lot. AFord(NYSE: F) F-150 pickup truck may be the best-selling vehicle on   the market today, but Kelley Blue Book says a model year 2016   F-150 has already lost 11% of its value, or some $2,083, at   auction.Image source: Ford.makeArticleAd();Gas-guzzlers make a comebackRecently, Kelley released its fourth-quarter 2016 survey on   retention values for manufacturer-suggested retail prices when a   car that's anywhere from one to three years old goes to auction.   It found thatfull-sized pickup truckslike Ford's have done surprisingly well at holding onto their   value, with the F-150 coming in fifth among the competition, but   theNissan(NASDAQOTH: NSANY) Titan is doing best overall, losing just 2% of   its value.However, the report took a closer look at model year 2015   vehicles to see those that retained values best, and apparently,   lower gas prices were having a big effect on buyer choices: The   two worst-performing segments were subcompact cars that retained   just 51% of their value and electric cars, which only managed to   hold onto 38%.The worst of the worst wereGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) hybrid electric Chevy Volt, keeping just 40% of its   value; the subcompact Mitsubishi Mirage and smart fortwo, at just   39% and 37%, respectively; and the all-electric Nissan Leaf,   which, at just 24%, was unable to retain even a quarter of its   value at auction.Part of the Leaf's problem, despite being the world's   best-selling EV and receiving generally favorable reviews from   sites, including Kelley Blue Book, was its limited range on   a charge, which at its peak is just 84 miles. That's not very   practical, and afterTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) began taking reservations for its $35,000 Model 3,   that put a huge dent in Leaf sales, which dropped 19% between   2015 and 2016. So, it's understandable why the car can't   hold any value at auction.Image source: Nissan.Better performance, better valueHowever, not all small vehicles did poorly. The SUV/Crossover   segment, for example, regardless of its price range, ranked among   the best performers for the 2015 model year, with four spots on   the top 10 list. The Jeep Wrangler and Nissan Xterra retained 87%   and 83% of their values, respectively, placing them fourth and   fifth in the top 10 models for the year, while the luxury   versions of the the Porsche Cayenne and Land Rover Range   Rover Sport also ranked highly, coming in third place and sixth,   respectively, with retained values of 89% and 82%.Perhaps not surprisingly, luxury vehicles did best overall,   taking six of the 10 slots overall, with the high-performance   segment having the second highest retention rate among all   vehicles, at 74%. Kelley Blue Book says it was the only segment   to finish the year having increased its retention value.Yet only two high-performance vehicles made the list, the Audi   R8, which did well by retaining 80% of its value, though that was   only good enough for tenth place, and the one car that actually   rose in value: the Mercedes-Benz SLS-class supercar.Image source: Mercedes-Benz.A rare findAlthough this vehicle has earned superlatives since its   introduction in 2010, and Kelley saw the 2015 model as a worthy   competitor to the Aston Martin DB9, Ferrari California, and   Bentley Continental GT, it may be that Mercedes put its   finger on the scale for its $200,000-plus gull-wing supercar,   because 2015 was the last year the SLS AMG   (Mercedes' high-performance division) would be produced. It   was subsequently replaced by the GT AMG.The SLS featured a 6.2-liter M159 V-8 engine that offered 583   horsepower at 6800 rpm, and went from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.   It was also a limited-production car, with just 350 vehicles   made, and with all the raves the vehicle enjoyed over its run,   naming it the Final Edition certainly ensured it would be a   sought-after vehicle for years to come.So, it might not be fair to put the SLS up against the No. 2   performer in vehicle value retention, the mid-size Toyota Tacoma   Double Cab pickup, which kept 89% of its value, but production   vehicles growing in value is enough of a rarified event to   warrant mention. Certainly as Harley-Davidson struggles to sell   its motorcycles these days, even if a used Hog still carries a   premium, Mercedes Benz can at least bask in the performance of   its supercar and see its value continue to grow in the years to   come.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Affordable EVs for the Masses Are Already Here;3/25/2017;"Electric vehicles have been a big topic of conversation in the   auto industry over the last few years, whether you're looking at   the disruptionTelsa(NASDAQ: TSLA) has created or the inroads the big automakers are   trying to make into the EV market. Still, with most EVs costing   well over $30,000, they aren't an option for most Americans.However, millions of Americans might soon be riding the   streets in electric vehicles every day -- just not the way you   might expect based on the media hype. It's electricbusesthat could soon be taking millions of people to their   destinations.Proterra electric bus. Image source: Proterra.makeArticleAd();Why electric buses make senseElectric transportation doesn't make sense for all situations,   but in those cases where there's a known range requirement and   sufficient time for recharging at night or between uses, there's   a big opportunity. That fits the bus market perfectly, given the   local nature of most municipal bus programs.The challenges to making the switch have always been the cost   and availability of electric buses, but those challenges are   receding. Proterra is leading the charge, and it's making a   strong case to cities across the country. The company can   manufacture buses with single-charge ranges from 49 to 350 miles,   depending on the model. For short-range buses, the charge time is   as little as 10 minutes, while larger battery packs could take   three and a half to five hours to get powered up for 251 to 350   miles of driving. Those range options will fit the needs of most   municipal bus routes.The bodies of Proterra's buses are made from a   carbon-fiber-reinforced composite material, so they're   lightweight, and the company says they can save their owners a   small fortune. According to Proterra, they'll cost $237,000 less   over their lifetimes on maintenance because what's under the hood   is so much simpler than in an ordinary bus -- essentially, just   an electric motor and a two-speed transmission. Better yet, at   $0.19 per mile, an electric bus beats $0.63 per mile for a hybrid   fuel vehicle and $0.84 per mile for diesel.Image source: Proterra.Purchase prices are plunging for electric     busesThe cost of an electric bus is still about $750,000, which is   well over the $450,000 or so that it costs to buy a diesel bus.   But when you look at the savings described above, the overall   cost case can already be made for switching to electric. And more   progress on that front is coming.Batteries account for a huge percentage of the cost of   electric buses, so the industry will be able to ride the cost   curve down along with automakers. Battery costs are held close to   the vest, but McKinsey & Company has said battery costs for   EVs fell from $1,000/kWh in 2010 to $227/kWh in 2016. At that   price, a 660 kWh battery pack would cost $149,820. But some   analysts project that costs will fall below $100 per kWh by 2030,   and many industry experts expect them to drop even faster. At   that point, that 660 kWh battery pack would cost $66,000 --   still a sizable chunk of money, but creating conditions under   which the overall cost of an EV bus could be lower than a   fossil-fuel model.The transition in this segment is progressing quickly. On theEnergy Gang Podcast, Proterra CEO Ryan Popple predicted that by 2020, one-third of   new buses in the U.S. will be EVs, and by 2030, 100% will be   electric. And a lot of the capability needed to make that change   is being built in-house, given the fact that Proterra designs and   manufactures its own battery packs, just like Tesla does. The sea   change in industry trajectory and the supply chain has   ramifications for everyone from battery makers to competitors in   the bus market.This isn't a transition that's just the dream of one bus   manufacturer, it's already taking place in cities across the   country. Philadelphia has 25 electric buses in its fleet, there   are 10 corporate shuttle buses run by JLL in Chicago, Park City   Transit in Utah runs 6 electric buses, and there aredozens of others operating electric buses across   the country, with more on the way. The transition really is taking hold in   the bus market.Who could be in troubleI've focused on the upside for electric buses and companies   like Proterra, which countsExelon(NYSE: EXC) ,General Motors(NYSE: GM) , andEdison International(NYSE: EIX) among its investors. But the real story here could be   the loss of business for other bus manufacturers and   suppliers.Cummins(NYSE: CMI) is a manufacturer of large engines and a major   supplier to the bus market. It's already seen revenue stagnate   and net income shrink over the past five years, so the loss of a   major market could push its business into an overall decline.New Flyer Industries,Daimler,Hyundai, andMitsubishiare also big bus manufacturers that could take a hit in demand if   electric buses start grabbing big market share. New Flyer is the   biggest of these players, and it's trying to move into electric   buses. But its development in that arena has been slower than   Proterra's, and it's still developing hydrogen-fueled options,   which could be a distraction in the long term.This could be an industry more ready for disruption than the   consumer vehicle market. There's financial justification for   going electric, and municipalities looking to cut costs will see   the savings potential as attractive. It may turn out that the way   millions of Americans take their first rides in EVs will be when   they climb on board a city bus -- which wouldn't be a bad thing   for the EV industry as a whole.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Supercharger Costs Are Still Relatively Small for Tesla Inc.;3/24/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) was undoubtedly a pioneer when it came to building   out a charging network for electric vehicles that truly enables   long-distance travel across the country. And the network remains   atop priorityfor Tesla today, particularly ahead of its Model 3 launch later   this year. The electric-car maker wants to be sure the network is   prepared to handle higher demand from a larger fleet of fully   electric vehicles.Some investors might wonder just how costly it is for Tesla to   build new Superchargers and to maintain them. Fortunately, Tesla   provided some insights into the costs of Superchargers in its   most recent annual report. As it turns out, the costs involved   with building out the world's largest network of fast-charging   stations are not only reasonable, but also sustainable.Tesla Supercharger. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();What Tesla said about Supercharger costsThere are essentially two main types of costs for Tesla's   Supercharger expansion: up-front capital outlay and operating   costs. Here's what Tesla said about each in its most recent   annual report.Capital outlay:Regarding up-front spending on Supercharger stations in 2016,   Tesla said it represented only a ""minimal portion of total   capital spending."" Assuming Tesla accounts for the book value of   its Supercharger locations on par with the amount it spends to   build them, this amount was probably about $40.6 million, since   the net book value of Tesla's Supercharger network increased from   $166.6 million in 2015 to $207.2 million in 2016.While $40.6 million might seem like a lot, it's a tiny portion   of Tesla's total capital expenditures. Tesla spent about $1.3   billion on capital expenditures in 2016.Since Tesla's total Supercharger locations expanded from 584   to 790 during this period, the company likely spent around   $197,000 per new Supercharger location during the year.Operating costs:Though there aren't any figures available on the operating costs   of maintaining Superchargers and footing their electric bills,   Tesla does give investors some context. The company says it   allocates Supercharger operating costs to automotive cost of   goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses,   which makes sense since the Supercharger experience is ultimately   one of the key selling points for a Tesla vehicle. These costs   ""were immaterial for all periods presented,"" Tesla said in its   2016 annual report.Overall, therefore, Supercharger costs are relatively small   for Tesla -- at least as a portion of total capital expenditures,   cost of goods sold, and operating expenses.Tesla's Supercharger expansionEven as Supercharger spending has remained nearly   unnoticeable, Tesla's Supercharger network is growing rapidly.   Measured by total connections (instead of total locations), Tesla   said last March it planned to double connections globally, from   3,600 to 7,200 by sometime in 2017. Tesla has already made   significant progress toward this target, with total Supercharger   connections today at 5,295.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.However, though Supercharger costs have been manageable amid   this rapid expansion, Supercharger utilization per dollar of   revenue from vehicle sales is bound to increase as the company   begins selling its Model 3 later this year for half the price of   its Model S and Model X. Fortunately, Tesla has a solution for   this. The company has been rolling out a number of key changes to   its Supercharger program, including afee for idle vehicles at Superchargersandfees per kilowatt-hour of chargingafter about 1,000 miles of free charging for each customer each   year.With Tesla's Supercharger network expansion already looking   like a feasible expenditure for the company to maintain as it   continues to grow, these new fees for Supercharging should easily   be enough for Tesla to keep the network from being a burden on   financials in the years to come.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Everything Elon Musk Announced This Morning;3/24/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is known for being quite active onTwitter, often taking the time to answer dozens of questions that are   lobbed at him over social media.

Kinda have to.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)March 24, 2017Dual-motor and performance Model 3 versions will come   laterMusk had previously said that highly optioned versions of the   Model 3 would get produced first, in line with the company's   previous vehicle launches. Tesla has typically done this to   accelerate the payback period for its manufacturing investments.   Musk says that Tesla will first focus on single motor (rear-wheel   drive) versions first. Performance models and those with dual   motors for all-wheel drive will actually now come later, although   presumably Tesla will still prioritize higher-end configurations   among single motor orders.@JimPengellyYes, but not until next year- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)March 24, 2017@FredericLambert@JimPengellyNo, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the   production ramp on schedule.

Will the Tesla Model 3 Beat the Competition in 2017?;3/23/2017;"The market for electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) has been growing at very strong double-digits, of course off a very small base. As a result, they were a little under 1% of total passenger car sales in 2016. But market watchers believe that 2016 was like the appetizer before the main course with 2017 and 2018 expected to see some momentum. This is not without reason because things do appear to be coming together for the market-Regulatory SupportMost important amongst these reasons is the fact that world leaders are coming together on environmental and climate change matters. There is a visible effort to promote clean energy in every aspect of life. Since auto emissions are one of the biggest reasons for air pollution and also contribute to global warming, this is where a lot of research is going on.Within the U.S., there is the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate that has been adopted by 10 states led by California and including Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The goal is to push automakers to research, develop and sell zero emission cars (these would be EVs rather than PHEVs although both receive some benefit).The ZEV authority of the concerned state certifies ZEVs, which then qualify for credits. An automaker has to sell a steadily rising number of EVs each year to meet the credit goal in a given year. For instance, in 2018, the percentage of zero-emission passenger cars and light-duty trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale is required to be 4.5%, in 2019 that number will rise to 7.0%, in 2020 it will be 9.5%, 2021 12.0%, 2022 14.5%, 2023 17.0%, 2024 19.5% and 2025 22.0%. So far so good.In February, the Auto Alliance trade group approached President Trump to relax the requirements from 2022 to 2025 because they say that Obama rushed through the mid-term review without taking into consideration upcoming research that would show the targets to be too burdensome. But President Trump has his work cut out if he is to relax the requirements, because he along with the Transportation Department would have to ask the Environmental Protection Authority to revise their rules and cancel a couple of waivers to the State of California that allow the state to frame its own stricter rules if the federal government relaxes.Moreover, California's rules can be adopted by other states, creating a messy compliance problem for automakers. So stopping California becomes important.So any alterations will take time and involve a complex process. Moreover, even if they are done, it will be a moderation of the rule rather than a directional change. Bottom line: the regulatory environment remains positive for EVs.Rapidly Falling Battery CostsBatteries are of course extremely important for electric cars because they determine how far they can go on a single charge. So the cost of the battery pack (the individual cells plus the supporting structure, cell cooling mechanisms and battery management systems) also determines to an extent the price of the car itself.According to a recent McKinsey report, battery costs have dropped from around $1,000 per kWh in 2010 to around $227 per kWh in 2016. McKinsey expects battery pack prices to drop to around $190/kWH by 2020 and $100/kWH by 2030, at which time the business is expected to be profitable for automakers.But R&D appears to be moving faster than estimates because TeslaTSLAhas said that it's already using a battery pack below the $190 range and expects to lower cost by another 30% before the Model 3 gets to market. The company, along with partner Panasonic has started mass production for its other storage products at the Gigafactory in Nevada.Production for the Model 3 will start in the second quarter and capacity can be expanded as needed (estimated to be 35 GWh/year in 2018, or nearly as much as the rest of the rest of the world's battery production combined). Musk claims that Gigafactory makes the ""highest energy density cell in the world and also the cheapest"". So let's hope they will allow the Model 3 to enter the market at the targeted $35,000 price point for mass market adoption.Tesla isn't the only one making progress. General MotorsGMproduct chief Mark Reuss has reportedly said that the Chevy Bolt uses battery cells (not the entire pack) costing $145 per kWh and is working to lower that number.An ancillary factor that can also help adoption is convenient and possibly wireless battery charging options. We seem to be really far from this today, not because the technology isn't there (it almost is), but because the number of battery charging stations are nowhere near the number of gasoline stations, so there's some infrastructure catchup waiting to get done there.Increasing Product RangeThe most popular electric and hybrid cars in 2016 were the Tesla Model S, Chevy Volt, Tesla Model X, FordFFusion Energi, Nissan LEAF, Ford C Max Energi and BMW i3. Of these, the Tesla cars, the Nissan LEAF and the BMW i3 were fully electric with the rest being hybrids.This year will see new fully electric models from players like GM, which launched the Chevy Bolt last December. Initial testers sound enthusiastic about the car despite its somewhat boxy design. So they could be popular with customers and also government departments that may not be so hung up on the more sexy Teslas.Tesla itself will launch the more efficient and lower-priced Model 3 (with autopilot and possibly, a solar roof option), but the launch date can have something to do with how many it manages to sell.Then there's also BMW, which estimates that it will sell 100,000 i3s this year, up from 40,000 last year. The company expects EVs and PHEVs to make up 15-25% of its sales by 2025 as it gradually electrifies all the BMW Group brands.Another car that picked up steam in the fourth quarter of 2016 is the hybrid ToyotaTMPrius Prime, so 2017 could see an uptick.One limiting factor for EVs and hybrids is their availability. If customers can't test drive the vehicle, they most likely won't place an order. Testing is largely available only in the ZEV mandate states.Growing Consumer InterestLow gas prices are an obvious deterrent to buying clean energy vehicles, but lower costs and discounting in some cases make them attractive. Plus, they also get a federal tax break. All this combined is leading to increased awareness of the concept, which could result in a spike in sales.Possible Problems for TeslaIncreasing Competition: We now know quite a bit about Tesla's battery production and also know that it intends to sell 500,000 electric cars a year by 2018 (that's next year). This is an exciting number on its own, but today there are a growing number of players in the space, increasing choice for consumers.Tesla's edge is in its design and autopilot system, and its battery technology that can allow it to give more at lower prices while making more profit. All these advantages may be put to the test more now than ever before.Cash strapped/competitors have deeper pockets: Tesla makes fully electric cars, which has both its positive and negative sides. In the current environment, since it produces only all-electric cars, it generates a whole lot of credits it doesn't need in the ZEV states. So it can sell these for a profit to those who need it, thus helping its profits and cash flow. This isn't of course enough to keep a leading edge company afloat because the thing that keeps it ahead of peers is R&D, which is expensive.The company has raised cash through both equity and debt so the Model 3 launch will go smoothly. But it certainly doesn't have a whole lot of marketing dollars left over, which will come in handy as the established automakers sink their teeth into EVs.Bottom LineTesla still appears to be well ahead of the pack. Not only is its battery tech more advanced, but it also has a fully compliant glass roof, which may be used to generate solar power to drive the car. Yes, others have tried it with limited success (such as the Prius). And no, that doesn't mean Tesla won't do a better job.The glass roof means that there probably won't be too much extra cost to add the PV cells, so who knows? After battery cost reduction, battery charging is the next big problem to solve in order to hasten electric car adoption and what can be better than a free-of-charge, auto recharge system?More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Safety Could Be a Key Selling Feature of Tesla's Model 3;3/23/2017;"It's hard to understate the importance of safety in the auto   industry, especially as U.S. automotive deaths rose 6% to   approximately 40,200 in 2016 -- the second year of increased   fatalities. That was the first time in a decade that auto   fatalities exceeded 40,000.Like most automakers,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) puts a lot of emphasis on the safety of its   vehicles and proudly touted that the Model S achieved the best   safety rating of any car ever tested back in 2013. As the company   continues to learn and evolve, its track record for safety should   also improve over time. With the Model 3 preparing to launch   within a matter of months and addressing a vastly larger market   than Tesla's current vehicles, the vehicle's safety will be   paramount.Model S and Model X. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Safety firstMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull that   downgraded shares to ""equalweight"" last summer only to re-upgrade   shares to ""overweight"" in January, has put out a research note to   investors this morning highlighting this theme.Jonas believes that the Model 3 could potentially be 10 times   as safe as the average car on the road today, and safety   qualities are considered among the most important selling   attributes of any car. This would be achieved through a   combination of hardware and software features that ""provide a   level of active safety that could significantly lead all other   cars on sale today."" The analyst believes that this could be an   ""aha!"" moment for customers later this year when the vehicle   launches.How Tesla vehicles with second-generation Autopilot hardware     sense the environment. Image source: Tesla.The key factor in improving the Model 3's safety will be   continued improvement of Autopilot. While Tesla's new version of   Autopilot that uses the second-generation hardware suite is just   now rolling out and is off to arough start, it should begin to improve rapidly as Tesla's machine learning   kicks in. Even for vehicles that do not activate Autopilot, Tesla   still gathers sensor data for fleet-learning purposes and   includes many safety features like automatic emergency braking   (AEB) as standard. Jonas estimates that by 2025 to 2030, the   company could be gathering roughly 400 million miles worth of   data per day (including a future Tesla Mobility ride-sharing   service).Jonas is referring to the current state of advanced driver   assistance, andnotany sort of full Level 4 or Level 5 autonomous driving, which is   likely still years away both on the regulatory front as well as   the technological one. Tesla says its current hardware suite will   eventually be capable of full self-driving capability. Jonas   believes that the Model 3 will provide ""superhuman"" assistance to   human drivers in the safety department.The firm is reiterating its overweight rating alongside a $305   price target.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Analyst: ""Superhuman"" Safety to Spur Demand for Model 3";3/23/2017;"According to one analyst's note to investors this week,Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) upcoming lower-cost Model 3 will have one huge   thing going in its favor: safety. The analyst, who is bullish onTesla stockand has a $305 price target for shares, says driver-assist   hardware and software included in the Model 3 will make the   $35,000 car 10 times safer than the average car.If Tesla's latest assertions about its plans for the   driver-assist technology set to be included in the Model 3 prove   to be true, this analyst may be onto something.Model 3. Image source: TeslamakeArticleAd();Model 3 safetyThe fact that Tesla's Model 3 is expected to be one of the   world's safest cars isn't news. The Model S sedan has already   scored a higher safety rating than any other vehicle ever tested   in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA)   crash tests. Furthermore, when Tesla first unveiled the Model 3   last March, CEO Elon Musk said the Model 3 would achieve five   stars in every category of NHTSA's crash test ratings.In addition, while Tesla charges customers a fee to activate   convenience driver-assist features in its vehicle, key   driver-assist safety features come standard. These standard   driver-assist features include active safety technologies, such   as collision avoidance and automatic emergency braking.But both Tesla and NHTSA assert that safety is also higher   when Autopilot is activated. So, Model 3 customers who upgrade to   the full Enhanced Autopilot, which includes automatic lane   changes, steering, and parking, the ability to ""summon"" the   vehicle short distances, and more, will likely benefit from even   a higher level safety -- and this seems to be the safetyMorgan Stanleyanalyst Adam Jonas is referring to in his note to investors (viaElectrek):We think the Model 3 will feature hardware and software that     provide a level of active safety that could significantly lead     all other cars on sale today and could, if the company achieves     its goal, be an order of magnitude (i.e. 10x) safer than the     average car on the road. According to nearly every OEM we talk     to, safety is the number 1 determinant of car purchases. Look     for safety to be the ""ah-hah!"" moment for this car due to     launch this year ... To be clear, we are talking about     automated driving (not fully autonomous driving) where the     driver has a legal obligation to keep hands on the wheel at all     times. The driver is still human... but with a 'superhuman'     assist.Of course, as Jonas notes, as this technology is refined and   as Tesla releases more features through over-the-air software   updates, the benefits should equally carry over to Model S and   Model X as well.Model S. Image source: TeslaNotably, Tesla's driver-assist features for vehicles in   October 2016 or later include more sensors and computer computing   power than in driver-assist systems typically found in vehicles   made by other manufacturers. All new Tesla vehicles now include   eight surround cameras with 360-degree visibility and up to 250   meters of range and 12 improved ultrasonic sensors. In addition,   Tesla recently released an important and unprecedented update for   its forward-facing radar sensor, enabling it to serve as a   primary control sensor alongside the company's vision system -- a   move Teslabelieveswill result in ""a dramatic improvement in the safety of the   vehicle.""Reducing car crashes by 90%According to a recent analysis by NHTSA, Tesla is already   making substantial progress in safety. The safety organization   concluded Tesla Autopilot-equipped vehicles sawcrash rates drop by 40%compared to vehicles without the technology. And this was notably   a study of vehicles produced before Tesla started rolling out its   updated Autopilot hardware in October last year.Shortly after NHTSA released these figures, Musk said onTwitterthat Tesla is targeting a 90% reduction in crashes for vehicles   with the company's updated Autopilot hardware.With safety serving as an important decision factor in car   purchases, Tesla's aggressiveness in rolling out software updates   to improve safety could help differentiate Model 3 when it   launches later this year.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Big-Risk Naked Puts With Even Bigger Reward;3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI usually use options, especially when it comes to naked puts, as a way to juice some additional income from a portfolio every month. It's one of the primary strategies for my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio.makeArticleAd();Source:GotCredit via FlickrHere's the thing, though: Naked put strategies are part of a long-term diversified portfolio. More than a way to create income, naked put options also make it possible to buy securities you've considered a position in, or positions you may add to.Remember, with these options, you sell the right for another investor to ""put,"" or sell, a security to you at a specific price on or before a specific date. If the stock is above that strike price on the contract's expiration date, the security does not get sold to you and you keep the money you were paid for selling the contract.Lately, a few investors with more appetite for risk asked if I could do a story on naked puts, but for momentum stocks. These have large premiums, so they can generate a lot of income.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsJust remember, if you get a momentum stock put to you, and the momentum falters, you could take a big lossNaked Puts: Netflix (NFLX)Source:via NetflixNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) may be a momentum stock unlike any other. NFLX has risen so high over the past seven years, even after a 2011 crash, that if you'd climbed in anywhere along the line, you made money. After faltering a bit post-split, NFLX is on the move again.Let me make it clear: Netflix is not a stock I want anything to do with. It has great programming, but the valuation is simply ridiculous. Others, however, may see an opportunity here.NFLX stock is at $142 as I write. A high-risk play would be to sell the 19 May $140 naked puts for $6.80. You'd make $680 for this contract, and if Netflix is put to you, you get it at an effective price of $133. It's about a 5% return for 57-day holding period, or about 33% annualized.Naked Puts: Tesla Inc (TSLA)Source: ShutterstockTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a joke to me. It makes cars, but no profit. And that is going to be the case for some time, if not forever. It just raised more capital, and I don't know what those investors are smoking, but they better sell their stock beforetheyget smoked.I just fail to see a market for Tesla cars in any significant-enough volume for TSLA to become a hugely profitable enterprise. Maybe it will make money, but not enough to justify the current stock price of $256.Still, it is a momentum stock and the volatility creates large premiums for naked puts. You could try and sell the 16 June $255 naked puts for $18, and pocket the $1,800 premium.3 Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy in a Bull MarketPersonally, I would reduce the risk by selling the $235 naked puts for $960. You make half as much, but you gain a $20 price buffer.Naked Puts: Chipotle (CMG)Source: ShutterstockChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.(NYSE:CMG) has simply been unable to bounce back from its E.coli PR disaster. It's a real business, but that business has taken a real blow. It shows just how tenuous consumers are with food and restaurants. Even people who were going to CMG every day for lunch: If they get spooked and find someplace else to eat, it's difficult to win them back.Still, CMG managed to squeak out a profit in 2016 and even $90 million in free cash. It's a far cry from the $400 million it used to make, but it's not dead yet.Chipotle shares recovered 20% off its low and is at $417. Here you may want to sell the 28 April $405 for $10. That'll earn you $1,000 and give you a $12 buffer - which ain't much. Still the contract only has 36 days, so things may work out.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, a specialty lender focusing on consumer finance.

Buy Tesla, Inc. Stock With a Lot Less Risk;3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you can look past what Wall Street thinks, it appears to be an opportune time to test driveTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). That doesn't mean to just run out and buy TSLA stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockInstead, I'll show you a way to drive profits from Tesla while reducing your risk.It's no secret: Tesla has its work cut out for it, and many on Wall Street don't think the company will survive the challenge. Wider-than-expected losses, cash burn, a less-subsidy friendly administration, staunch competition fromGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andBMW, disappointing deliverables guidance during February's corporate confessional … to some, the future for TSLA looks bleak.One recent shot fired over the bow came from the venerable Goldman Sachs. The investment bank cut shares of TSLA to a rare ""Sell"" from ""Neutral"" as February rolled into March and a couple days after Tesla's earnings release.The upshot of Goldman's recommended warning is the downgrade mostly failed to provide anything new under the sun as it relates to Tesla. Also, as I noted in a moreoptimistic opinion of TSLA stock, timely analyst moves from the banker haven't been spot-on.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotAnd in the weeks since Goldman's latest move on Tesla? Again, the firm has been ""early"" at best. Tesla stock is actually up about 5% since the downgrade.More recently, Wednesday found another of Wall Street's elite waving the caution flag on TSLA. Oppenheimer's more detailed note acknowledged forward progress, but ultimately warned of the company being""fraught with risk""as it has transformed itself into an auto and energy concern.Note that Oppenheimer didn't downgrade TSLA. But an existing ""hold"" rating did suggest that shareholders should cool off.Tesla Stock ChartClick to EnlargeAs Tesla's weekly chart shows, shares have made some very nice technical progress in 2017, which favors bullish investors. Not only is Tesla stock up nearly 20% year-to-date, but the solid outperformance and relative strength have cleared significant weekly chart resistance.Also reassuring is the fact that TSLA shares have held a test of the prior breakout area. The bullish price action is signaling support on the part of investors as part of a fairly ordinary 16% corrective move from this year's high.The one technical item I'm marginally concerned with is stochastics. The secondary indicator is showing a neutral reading, while pointing down. As much, there's no sign of a confirmation the low in place will ultimately hold.How to Trade TSLA StockGiven an overall nice-looking technical situation that's marred only by stochastics and an earnings catalyst still two months out, I like the idea of using a targeted long call butterfly as a moderately bullish position in the nearer-term to catch profits in TSLA stock.The butterfly is one of the lower cost spreads available. By targeting an out-of-the-money strike, the trader can generate a decent range for profitability.The one real downside with this type of position is too much upside as the debit paid is forfeited above the highest positioned strike. But because this butterfly expires before a potential earnings catalyst, and given its low cost, I'm receptive to the trade-off.Buy Tesla Stock, Just Not for the CarsThe April $260/$270/$280 is priced at $1.60 with TSLA stock at $256.The targeted butterfly establishes a healthy profit zone from $261.60 to $278.40 at expiration with a max profit of $8.40.The max return of 525% is a lot more improbable thansolar-powered roofs on automobilescosting less than today's conventional tops. That gain would require TSLA landing squarely at $270 on expiration and the absence of trading slippage.Bottom line: It's easy to like the ability to profit anywhere from a modest 2% rally to a more massive (and less likely) 9% gain in TSLA stock, especially when you put just 0.625% down.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Should Tesla Inc. Investors Be Concerned about Trump's Emissions Agenda?;3/23/2017;"Love him or hate him, nobody can argue that President Donald   Trump hasn't made a lot of noise since he took his seat in the   Oval Office. And while many of the policies his administration   will promote remain up in the air -- and will for some time --   some major automakers have already begun changing up their   strategies.One policy shift that could impactTesla Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) investors is if Trump and his appointees loosen   automotive emissions standards.After all, oil is fairly cheap now, and if gasoline-powered   vehicles need less of the expensive technology being developed by   automakers to meet the stricter pollution standards put in place   by the Obama administration, traditional vehicles will likely   come with lower sticker prices. That would make it more difficult   for consumers to justify buying electric vehicles, which could   slow their mainstream adoption.makeArticleAd();But is this really an issue for Tesla investors to be   concerned about? If recent news is any indication, don't lose any   sleep just yet.What's Trump doing anyway?If you remember, just before Barack Obama was set to depart   the White House, the EPA tried to secure the stricter automotive   emissions standards that were put in place during his   administration. Those efforts may be to no avail: Last Wednesday   Trump announced that his administration would reopen and review   those emissions mandates. That's positive news for producers of   large SUVs and trucks, such as Detroit automakers, but not as   positive for automakers like Tesla that are pushing for a faster   adoption of electric vehicles.Image source: Tesla, Inc.The consequences of keeping the current standards are dire, if   you're inclined to believeFordCEO Mark Fields. Early in 2017, when Fields met with Trump, he   claimed that 1 million jobs would be at risk if regulations   weren't toned down.Independent analysts respondedthat the figure he cited was a worst-case scenario from a report   that has been scathingly criticized for basing its results on a   set of dubious assumptions.However, there's no doubt that keeping strict emissions   standards, and forcing automakers to accelerate research and   development spending on technology required to meet those   standards, will be costly. The EPA estimated the cost to add   fuel-saving technologies could reach $1,565 per vehicle,   depending on the time frame. That's a significant chunk of change   to tack on to a new car purchase.The relaxation of regulations   could help most automakers save a few bucks and keep their   sticker prices a bit lower.The good news is...Here's the good news for Tesla investors: A bunch of U.S.   cities remain willing to spend billions on electric cars and   trucks.More specifically, according to a recent Bloomberg article,   more than 30 cities, including New York and Chicago, have asked   for specific cost information and details on the feasibility of   producing and purchasing114,000 electric vehicles-- from police vehicles to street sweepers. That number would be   close to three-fourths of total U.S. plug-in sales during 2016.   In essence, those municipalities are looking to prove there is   plenty of demand for electric vehicles -- starting with   themselves.That position was stated firmly by Daniel Zarrilli, New York   City's senior director of climate policy and programs, in an   interview with Bloomberg: ""Now more than ever there is a need for   cities' leadership on climate. We really want to send a message   that there is a growing market for electric vehicles --   regardless of what is happening in D.C.""It appears that cities and the automotive industry in general   understand that our vehicular future is electric, and that a   near-term change in policy by Trump's administration won't derail   long-term plans -- and certainly won't derail Tesla. Truth be   told, a move to roll back emissions standards could have hurt   Tesla if it the company were already the size it hopes to be in   five to 10 years, but at this point, the impact will be less of a   negative for Tesla and more of a positive for Detroit   automakers.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy Tesla Stock, Just Not for the Cars;3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is well-known within the investment community. Bears argue that Tesla is a cash-strapped company rich in valuation, while bulls says Tesla stock is a buy based on its future potential. Most investors base much of their thesis on the company's car production.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSpecifically, they focus on Tesla's current deliveries of the Model S and Model X. They also focus on whether Elon Musk & Co. will be able to mass produce the Model 3. If the upstart futurist can efficiently produce and sell enough of the Model 3, bulls will view this as a success.The plan is for Tesla's affordable, mass-consumer Model 3 - reportedly in the mid-$30,000 range - to engage both mid-tier and high-tier buyers. Should a hiccup in production arise or a spike in costs materialize, however, bears will sink their teeth into the notion that success may not be so imminent.Both the bull and bear theses overlook something crucial to the future of Tesla: Energy.Tesla Stock's True DriverTesla acquired SolarCity in late-2016, giving the company a new business segment with solar. While solar may not be the most profitable venture, its synergies could be the focus.TSLA has been quietly ramping up its energy business. Specifically, Tesla produces both residential and commercial battery packs. On the commercial side, these refrigerator-sized batteries serve as a backup power source to municipalities.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotTeslarecently installed396 of these batteries for a city in California. It did so ahead of schedule as well. This may seem like an immaterial footnote, but it shows that management's execution is on point. This could be a key selling point alongside the product when it comes to getting new cities on board.Even more recently, TSLAunveiled a big projecton the Hawaiian island Kauai. Tesla installed almost 55,000 solar panels in combination with 272 commercial batteries. The project will generate energy by day and night thanks to the battery and solar panel combination. Additionally, it will save about 1.6 million gallons of diesel per year.Tesla's Tipping PointThese are just two recent projects. Admittedly, the trickle down to the bottom line will not be significant at first. Now that Tesla's Gigafactory has started to come online, battery production won't be as constrained.If TSLA is able to garner more contracts for these types of projects, it could create a tipping point in its business model.Tesla stock is currently tied to auto production, likeFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) orGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM). As demand grows for Tesla's vehicles, it will be more susceptible to the cyclical whims of the auto market. If Tesla can balance out the ups-and-downs of this market with a more consistent energy business, though, investors should cheer the move.Our energy grid is susceptible to issues, but through backup storage via batteries and power generation via solar panels, Tesla is distinguishing itself from the competition.Bottom Line on Tesla StockIt's not all roses and rainbows for Tesla stock. Bears can point to lithium supply constraints or rising costs as negative catalysts. Tesla israising capitaland there is Model 3 execution risk, too. These are all true points.

3 Stocks I'm Never Selling;3/23/2017;"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with     outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is     forever.These words, written by Warren Buffett in his 1998 letter to   shareholders ofBerkshire Hathway, have become a mantra for many who invest Foolishly. I've   personally followed this advice for years, andmy portfoliohas flourished as a result.So, what stocks do I currently own that are worthy of holding   ""forever""? I thinkMastercard(NYSE: MA) ,FactSet Research Systems(NYSE: FDS) , andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)  are three excellent candidates. Here's   why.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Still an early growth storySuccessful long-term investing is all about buying companies   with durable business models and significant growth potential.   Those traits perfectly describe payment processing giant   Mastercard, which is why I've long considered this company to be   a core holding.Mastercard's vast network helps merchants, consumers, and   financial institutions to facilitate electronic payments. Since   making digital payments is traceable, convenient, secure, and   offers rewards, consumers in developed markets have accepted them   with open arms. In exchange for its services, Mastercard pockets   a small fee for each successful transaction. With more than 2.3   billion cards in circulation, consumers swipe a card with a   Mastercard logo more than 56 billion times each year. That allows   those small fees to add up quickly, which is how Mastercard   pulled in more than $10 billion in total revenue last year.While Mastercard's business model is a thing of beauty, the   reason I believe this company is a ""hold forever"" stock is that   roughly 85% of transactions worldwide still occur with cash   or check. With the global middle class expected to rise in the   coming decades, I think this figure will continuously shift in   favor of electronic payments. That hints that Mastercard's   growth story is still just getting warmed up, which is why I plan   on hanging around for the long haul.Giving Wall Street an edgeEvery investor knows that you can't make smart decisions   without access to data. Banks, hedge funds, insurance providers,   mutual funds, and others all feel the same way and are willing to   pay a premium to get their hands on high-quality information.   That fact keeps FactSet Research Systems' services in demand.FactSet is a data aggregator that collects information from   hundreds of sources and then sells access to this information on   a subscription basis. The company counts a wide range of   financial companies as customers, and once they start using   FactSet's system, they tend to become heavily reliant on the   data. In turn, they willing sign long-term contracts with   FactSet that feature annual price increases.FactSet's results show that customers continue to highly value   the company's services. Last quarter, FactSet's customer   retention ratewas 95%, which speaks volumes about the company's product offering.What's wonderful about this business is that the company's   financial statements are highly predictable. In fact, FactSet has   reported 36 consecutive years of revenue growth and 20 straight   years of profit growth. Those are remarkable figures.Looking ahead, investors can bank on the company using   acquisitions, price increases, and international expansion   to drive its top line higher. When combined with expense control   and share buybacks, FactSet should be able to leverage that   growth into even bigger gains on the bottom line. This rock-solid   business model is why I plan on counting myself as a shareholder   for decades to come.Driving a sustainable futureThere's no doubt that Tesla is the most   controversial name on this list. The upstart automaker has   yet to produce a full-year GAAP profit, has a habit of missingits own guidance, and has had to delay several product launches due to production   challenges. With shares trading at more than 6 times sales, I'm   sure many investors would likely consider Tesla to be a more   attractive short candidate than long.I get all of that criticism, but given the company'sunbelievably ambitious goals, I still think the sky is the limit for this company. After all,   Tesla has a real shot at disrupting the auto, utility, roofing,   and energy storage sectors all once. The opportunity is so big   that there are literally trillions of dollars in sales up for   grabs.What could that opportunity mean for investors? Here's a quote   from CEO Elon Musk in June of last year that spells out what   he believes is possible:I think as a combined automotive and power storage and power     generation company; I think the potential is there for Tesla to     be a $1 trillion company, market cap company.Yes, he said a$1 trillioncompany. For perspective, Tesla's current market cap is about $43   billion. If Elon's prediction comes true, then Tesla could   literally be a 20-bagger for investors, even at today's lofty   levels.Now, I understand Musk is famous for making wild predictions,   but a small part of me can't help but think he might actually   have a shot at pulling this off. After all, even the most   bearish of investors has to admit that what this company has   achieved thus far is nothing short of amazing. As long as Musk is   calling the shots, I wouldn't bet against this company reaching   its goals.In total, a small part of me believes Telsa could truly be a   once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. That's why I plan on   holding onto my shares indefinitely, for better or worse.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

9 Key Metrics From Tesla, Inc.'s Annual Report;3/22/2017;"Last year marked another 12 months of sharp growth for   electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) . As deliveries of its new Model X SUV ramped up   steeply during the year, revenue soared.Since Tesla's annual report for 2016 was released earlier this   month, it's a good time to review the company's performance last   year. Here's a close look at some of Tesla's most defining   metrics from 2016.The Model S. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();$7 billion:Tesla's revenue hit $7 billion in 2016. While that's still a far   cry from Detroit's Big Three, each of which boasts revenue well   over $100 billion, it's a nice increase compared to Tesla's $4   billion in revenue in 2015, or its $413 million in 2012 -- the   year Tesla launched its Model S sedan.73%:Helping mitigate concerns about Tesla's ability to scale its   automotive business, gross profit last year surged 73%, from $924   million in 2015 to $1.6 billion in 2016.($675 million):But despite growing revenue and gross profit, the electric-car   maker still didn't achieve profitability for the full year. Tesla   lost about $675 million, though the loss was narrower than the   company's $889 million loss in 2015.1,153%:Tesla's energy-generation and storage revenue catapulted last   year, rising from $14.5 million in 2015 to $181 million in 2016.   While $84.1 million of this increase is due to the inclusion of   SolarCity revenue from the acquisition date of Nov. 21, a good   chunk of the increase was driven by higher energy-storage revenue   as the company ramped up energy-storage production and sales.64%:Tesla's vehicle production increased 64% year over year, driven   primarily by a steep ramp-up in Model X production throughout the   year.The Model X. Image source: Author.25,300:Tesla delivered about 25,300 Model X units during 2016, up from   about 200 in 2015. The big increase in Model X deliveries is a   result of the vehicle's launch timing. Tesla launched the Model X   toward the end of 2015, but didn't really begin to meaningfully   ramp up production until the first quarter of 2016.51,000:Tesla's Model S remained the company's bread and butter. Tesla   sold about 51,000 Model S units, up 1% year over year. The   vehicle continues to outsell all other similarly priced large   luxury sedans in North America, and in some key markets in   Europe.790:As Tesla's total vehicle deliveries increased about 51% during   2016, the company aggressively expanded its Supercharger network   to support its growing fleet. Tesla ended the year with 790   Supercharger locations and 5,043 Supercharger connections at   these locations. This is up from 582 sites and 3,448 connections   at the end of 2015.A Model S charging at a Supercharger location. Image source:     Author.$825 million:Tesla incurred about $825 million of costs for its   under-construction Gigafactory, a massive factory designed to   help build enough batteries to equip 500,000 vehicles in 2018,   and to support Tesla's growing energy-storage sales. This is up   significantly from the company's $318 million in costs for its   Gigafactory in 2015.Overall, Tesla's 2016 was a year marked by significant growth.   But the capital-intensive nature of the auto business continued   to weigh on the company's profitability.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2 Concerns Facing Tesla, Inc. Investors;3/22/2017;"Few people will argue thatTesla, Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) isn't an amazing start-up story in an auto   industry that isn't easy on newcomers. The electric-vehicle   automaker has lit a fire under major automakers and likely pushed   up the development of their EV programs by years. However, partly   due to the hype surrounding Tesla's potential, it trades at an   extremely high valuation despite burning through cash, and its   market cap is a rich $42 billion. For comparison,Fordwhich has recently posted years of record profits, trades at a   $48 billion market cap.Due to those rich valuations, jumping on board the Tesla   bandwagon seems risky for the following two main reasons.Culture concernsInvestors shouldn't overlook the fact that Tesla's culture has   been criticized for some time. It's difficult to gauge how much   of a direct impact this has on results, but what's clear is that   top executive talent is consistently choosing to leave. Just   recently, Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler announced his   impending departure after spending slightly over a year at the   automaker. Last May, two key executives also hit the road,   including Greg Reichow, Tesla's vice president of   manufacturing.makeArticleAd();In mid 2016, one of Tesla's biggest hires to that point, Rich   Heley, who rapidly rose through the ranks to vice president of   product technology, decided to joinFacebook. Other top executives to leave include Mateo Jaramillo, vice   president at Tesla Energy, Michael Zanoni, vice president of   finance and worldwide controller, James Chen, vice president of   regulatory affairs and deputy general counsel, and Ricardo Reyes,   vice president of global communications. According toBloomberg, more than two dozen management departures over the past year   have been recorded.These departures don't mean the sky is falling, and Tesla   likely has an unfathomable amount of resumes from talented   contenders being sent in on a daily basis. The problem is that on   the eve of launching the company's most important vehicle to   date, the Model 3, having a consistent and steady executive team   is important to meet objectives and deadlines -- and strong   management in general is one key factor investors should highly   consider when examining a company.When small flaws go mainstreamIf you have a chance, read my colleague's story about   repairing his Tesla Model S andthe nightmare that ensued. Beyond repair woes and the time it takes to get your car back   in some cases, there's no shortage of flaws. Mechanical problems   and software glitches affect many of the vehicles. Some of those   are minor issues such as doors not being properly aligned, and   some are design flaws such as the Model X's wing doors   accidentally smashing into things the sensors didn't detect.Tesla's production floor. Image source: Tesla, Inc.Up to this point, it hasn't turned consumers away from owning   Teslas, but there's a reason for that. Right now consumers are   paying a steep price, often around $100,000, to be an early   adopter in what could be the future of the automotive industry.   Flaws likely aren't going to make early adopters love their Tesla   any less. The issue goes deeper than the flaws themselves,   as Tesla is continuously working to fix these production issues.   The problem is that once the Model 3 goes mainstream, with a   price tag starting in the mid $30,000s, these are issues that   mainstream consumers won't take as lightly.Furthermore, Tesla recently had aprivate investor call, and it's rumored that the company willskip its beta prototype stage on the Model 3-- typically it goes from alpha prototype to beta prototype to   release candidates -- and will instead go straight to release   candidates. Perhaps Tesla believes its prototype is indeed ready,   or perhaps it's rushing to get the vehicle out too early. That's   a risk, no matter how you view it, and a big one because Tesla   needs to get the Model 3 nearly perfect to foster mainstream   adoption.As a company trying to change the automotive industry for the   better, Tesla is easy to root for. Owning shares of Tesla given   the culture and product concerns on the eve of the release of the   critical Model 3 isn't as easy to do, especially as expensive as   shares currently appear. Keep these two concerns in mind --   investors also would be wise to look into Tesla's cash burn, debt   load, and acquisition of SolarCity -- as we navigate through what   could be a make-or-break year for the company.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Vale SA (ADR) (VALE) Stock Is Still a HUGE Risk;3/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the last month, several analysts have been telling all who would listen that they need to buy mining stocks.

But there is more to the VALE investment case than that.VALE: Brazil Turning a CornerMore than half of VALE stock is held by agencies of the Brazilian government, which has been convulsed in bribery scandals, and the government is now separating itself from business. Creatinga single class of stockwill water down government influence, although thatmay not be as big a deal as it appears.CEO Murilo Ferreira isgetting the boot in Mayand while new president Michel Temerwill name the replacement, it's expected to be the last time the government calls the tune in this way. Temer's government is said to be more conservative, more pro-business than that of predecessor Dilma Rousseff.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotBut there's more.VALE produced a record amount of iron ore last year, moving production from southern Brazil to the Amazon, and it will soon re-start production at a mine co-owned withBHP Billiton Limited (ADR)(NYSE:BHP) that suffered a deadly dam burst in 2015.Bymothballing inefficient mines, re-opening the Samarco mine with BHP and increasing production at more-efficient mines, the hope is that VALE stock will get good margins and make fat profits in 2017. By removing government interference from the boardroom, the hope is that Vale shareholders will reap the full benefits.However, as InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezektook a look at all this recently, he concluded that, while many signs are positive for VALE in the near-term, it's still a Brazilian company.While 3G Capital is also a Brazilian company, the government has no holding in it, as it does in Vale, and the local economy is still mismanaged. A 2016 turnaround for Brazil never materialized, with an unexpected drop in GDP, so trust is at a low ebb.Then there is VALE's debt - about $30 billion worth. That's less than 30% of the company's assets, and it has been heading down in recent years, but the boom-bust cycle for mining stocks makes that debt a significant overhang if something unexpected happens in the iron ore market. The government's continuing role in VALE is why Bezek can't recommend the stock.The Bottom Line on VALE StockVALE, and companies like it, are a big reason why U.S. investors do most of their international buying through mutual funds that take out a big piece of the action each year in the form of fees, but earn those fees by supposedly staying on top of things, and keeping a diversified portfolio.Don't Wait for Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock to Fall Back to EarthInvestors are quickly learning, however, that political risk exists everywhere, and that such risk isn't a question of left or right, but right and wrong. Brazil has been down so long anything looks up from here, and folks like the 3G boys have always made money there regardless of the government, taking advantage of instability and making it their friend.In other words, if you like a little speculation, and you're tired of playing the big techs, take a good look at VALE stock. Your speculation is as much on iron prices as on Brazil, which means you're betting here on Trump's ability to whip deflation now.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Don’t Wait for Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock to Fall Back to Earth;3/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors who have been patiently waiting forTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock to come down from its lofty perch to a more familiar support level in a bid to gain fresh entry points could be outta luck. After weeks of drifting lower, TSLA stock has managed to reverse course and is now on a fresh up leg. Tesla stock has racked up gains of 8% over the last 10 days and it is trading just 4% below its 2017 high.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTSLA stock is up 22.6% in the year-to-date.New Era for TSLA StockTrouble for TSLA stock begun in late February after the company delivered a disappointing earnings report. Following the report, Tesla stock suffered a massive 7% one-day loss that effectively ended a powerful 11-week bull run that had culminated in a 60% gain.The post-earnings breakdown created an ominous top after the stock had retested major resistance near 2014, 2015 and 2017 highs. Long-term Tesla bulls might concur with sentiments by fellow Investor Place contributor Dana Blankenhorn who observes thatTSLA stock has been range-boundover the past three years. Dana says to use $250 as a sell signal or to short the stock and $200 as a buy signal or to go long.But a deeper pullback now looks unlikely. TSLA stock has been showing solid support around the $237 to $241 zone, which suggests that the rules of the game have now changed. Perhaps that should hardly come as a surprise considering that we are now seeing the first innings of Tesla as a mass manufacturer of EVs as opposed to a luxury car maker.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackTSLA stock has mainly been range bound in the past due to the company's unreachable deadlines, including a 3-year delay for Model S.But Tesla is a different company now. The company managed to kick off production of Li-ion batteries at its Gigafactory in January ahead of schedule and also successfully launched a new Autopilot system as promised. TSLA is still very much a startup, but seems to have learned from its past missteps.With the excitement surrounding the launch of Model 3 later in the year, investors should not wait for the stock to fall dramatically even if it misses delivery estimates in the coming quarters.Tesla Stock: Cash Burn Worries a Long Way OffTesla bears have long argued that it's only a matter of time before the company suffered a severe cash crunch that would decimate TSLA stock. Tesla is a serial big-time spender that has been burning cash for fun with little to show for it in the way of profits. The company announced that it plans to spend at least $2.5 billion during the first half of the year to bring its manufacturing facilities up to speed in readiness for Model 3.This in effect means that Tesla will have spent $10 billion on R&D since 2014. For some perspective, mature incumbentsGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) spent $8.1 billion and $7.3 billion on R&D in 2016 and sold 3.9 million and 5.5 million vehicles, respectively. In comparison, Tesla sold just 76,000 vehicles last year. Tesla's market cap is now approaching that of the two companies, and investors can be forgiven for feeling jittery about Tesla's impending capital raise(s).But the company recently quelled any such fears - at least for the foreseeable future. Tesla has just successfullycompleted a $1.2 billion capital raisethrough a mix of new shares and convertible debt. That was considerably less than what Wall Street was modeling for, meaning cash burn might not be as bad as previously imagined. TSLA sold 1.3 million shares at $262 per pop to raise $350 million, amounting to less than 1% share dilution. The balance came from convertible notes that will be due by 2022.Why the Next Frontier for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Be FinanceInvestors can now rest assured that TSLA's cash position is out of the danger zone. Deutsche Bank estimates the EV maker will exit 2017 with $1.8 billion in cash, good enough to provide a comfortable cushion.Bottom Line on TSLA StockDeutsche Bank has projected that Tesla is likely to deliver 22,000 Model 3 units in 2017 and 250,000 units in 2018. So the company might not need to make more trips to the secondary and capital markets during the current year. Tesla though intends to jack up Model 3 production rate from 5,000 units per week in 2017 to 10,000 units per week in 2018, which implies that another big capital raise in the coming year cannot be ruled out.The good thing though is that by this time, TSLA will officially have changed its status to a big-time player. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says Model 3 is designed for manufacturing and that the company understands manufacturing a lot better than it did in the past. Just don't hold your breath for TSLA stock to fall back to earth.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 Months7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeThe postDon't Wait for Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock to Fall Back to Earthappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Just What Exactly Is SolarCity's Future Under Tesla?;3/22/2017;"SolarCity's transition to a subsidiary ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a little strange for the formerly   dominant solar installer. The company is losing market share,   shrinking installations, and now has to change its entire sales   model to work with the existing Tesla sales infrastructure.Amid the changes, investors should look at what they can   expect from SolarCity in the years ahead. Whether successful or   not, here's what SolarCity's future looks like under Tesla.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();A smaller, more focused companyThere's no question that Tesla is changing the solar business   at SolarCity. Installations fell in the fourth quarter of 2016 to201 MW from 253 MW a year ago. Potentially more consequential is that cash sales were 28% of   deployments, up from 4% a year ago.Tesla clearly wants SolarCity to be a company more focused on   profitable installations and cash or loan financing. This will   take a lot of emphasis away from the leasing model that SolarCity   was built on, but it's also a very positive move given industry   trends. What we haven't yet seen is that focus turn into higher   margins.Can solar be an add-on to EVs?The other big strategy change Tesla is making at SolarCity is   the move of the sales process away from cost-intensive   door-to-door and telemarketing strategies to sales through Tesla   stores. In theory, this way, customers would be highly likely to   go solar before coming to SolarCity and solar panels could be an   add-on to an EV.What's unknown is whether that strategy will be successful. We   know that customers who own EVs are more likely to be interested   in and buy solar, but will they do so in the same transaction? Or   will they want to have their EV and solar coming from the same   company? That's the theory, but only time will tell.Will SolarCity ever make money?The challenge for Tesla in folding SolarCity into its business   is to generate enough money to justify the acquisition and   associated debt. In the third quarter of 2016, the final quarter   SolarCity operated as an independent company, SolarCity had   $257.7 million in operating costs, including $204.2 million of   SG&A and R&D expenses. Extrapolated over an entire year,   Tesla took on $800 million in annual operating costs that would   need to be paid for somehow.As Tesla transitions to more solar system sales and a larger   energy storage business, we should see revenue and gross margins   be able to cover the operating costs I highlighted. However, make   no mistake, this will not be easy. In the fourth quarter of 2016,   the company generated just $131.4 million in energy-related   revenue, which netted a gross margin of just $3.6 million, or   2.7% of revenues.Management said this margin will trend higher toward a 20%-25%   gross margin, but it's hard to see how that happens until   evidence proves it's feasible. Solar panel manufacturers, solar   installers, and battery companies aren't inherently high-margin   businesses and they largely operate in a commodity-type   environment. Even if SolarCity is successful in its new strategy   under Tesla, it may never be the huge financial success that Elon   Musk and investors want it to be. And, at worst, it could be a   drain of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash every year.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

AMD's (AMD) Success Is Not The Death Of Intel (INTC);3/22/2017;"My article on Tuesday, which highlighted (some might say “boasted”) the recent achievements of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), was perceived by some readers as an attack on Intel (INTC). But that was the intent.While I’m admittedly an unabashed cheerleader of Intel, I can still appreciate the rags-to-riches story that AMD CEO Lisa Su has successfully executed since her appointment in January 2012. AMD stock traded at $5.40 at the time. The stock recently made a 52-week high of $15.55. Save for the people at AMD headquarters, no one anticipated this remarkable turnaround. But what’s good for AMD is also good for Intel since a excitement surrounding chip battles increases consumer interest.Notably, this renewed battle comes even as the rate of PC revenue continues to decline. In other words, both companies, which struggled at the height of the mobile era, have moved beyond being just PC shops. And while AMD continues to make impressive leaps, Intel is still the leader. The extent to which AMD pushes Intel to innovate, the better off Intel will be. And that’s exactly what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has begun to demonstrate.makeArticleAd();Looking to avoid the another mobile-type miss, Intel is pushing heavily to be future-ready. Fresh off its second mega-deal in less than two years, Krzanich — in his fifth year at the helm — seems intent on putting Intel’s cash to use. The company’s$15.3 billion acquisitionof Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY) was the most recent example. This follows $16.7 billion deal for Altera back in 2015.These two deals suggest that Intel is not worried about what AMD is doing. It can be argued that it should. But Krzanich, who has found ways to get Intel’s top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. Not only does Intel, thanks to Altera, now have an inside track on the Internet of Things and data center market, Mobileye now puts Intel in the driver's seat in the realm of autonomous cars, allowing it to better compete with Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL).In both acquisitions, however, market pundits, who were unable to immediately see the financial benefits, criticize Intel for overpaying. But, recall, Google was laughed at for buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Today YouTube is worth anestimated $40 billiontoday. Likewise, Facebook (FB) was criticized for taking out Instagram. But assuming Intel can realize the estimated $70 billion total addressable market of driverless cars by 2030, Mobileye could prove to be a bargain.In short, AMD’s improvements don’t spell the doom of Intel. The management of both companies are executing on their stated operating objectives. And both stocks should perform well in the next 12 to 18 months. As to which stock is right for you? That all depends on where your allegiance is."

Forget Financials, Buy These 5 Great Auto Stocks Instead;3/21/2017;"The final outcome of last week's closely watched policy meeting came as quite a surprise to most investors. Though the central bank did raise rates as was widely expected, it adopted an unusually cautious tone about the path of future rate hikes. Such a turn of events weighed on financials, widely believed to be the major and most immediate beneficiary of a tighter rate environment.In contrast, auto stocks, a category which was expected to feel the brunt of higher rates, has performed relatively better. A variety of factors, including lowoil pricesand a confident consumer, have ensured that these stocks have moved steadily upward. In such a situation, investors would do well to select auto stocks with strong fundamentals over financials.Fed Turns Cautious, Financials DipAt the close of its two-day policy meeting on Mar 15, the Fed increased the federal funds rate from a range of 0.5%-0.75% to 0.75%-1%. But contrary to expectations, the central bank declared that it expected to raise rates on only two more occasions this year. This was at wide variance with market expectations of a minimum of three further rate increases.The Fed's conservative tone pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to its biggest one-day drop since June, falling to 2.500% on Mar 15 from 2.595% the day before. This decline in bond yields spurred some selling in bank stocksShares of big banks including The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.GSand Bank of America Corp.BACdeclined 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Exchange-traded funds that track the financial sector also showed lackluster trade. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) was down 0.7%. Financials were the weakest among the S&P 500's 11 sectors on Mar 15. Since then, the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) has declined 2.1%. (Read:5 Biggest Winners from the Fed Rate Hike)Auto Stocks GainMeanwhile, a combination of factors has ensured that auto stocks have been faring significantly better. The First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF (CARZ) has gained more than 6% year to date, in line with the S&P 500's increase. Soft crude prices have been pushing up the sales of utility vehicles and trucks. This is helping to counteract the decline in demand for small cars.Among major automakers, Ford Motor CompanyFGeneral Motors CompanyGMand Tesla, Inc.TSLAhave gained 1.2%, 2.5% and 22.6%, respectively. Upbeat consumer sentiment has also played a significant role in propelling the sector northward. An increase in rates, leading to an eventual hike in car loan rates, is a factor which has left the sector virtually untouched.Steady jobs growth and wage gains have played a key role in this regard. U.S. employers added 235,000 new jobs in February, against expectations of 191,000 additions. Wages for American workers, meanwhile, went up 0.2% last month to $26.09 an hour. The sector is also likely to receive significant support from the new administration. Speaking at a meeting with key industry stakeholders, Trump indicated that he would be rolling back the fuel efficiency standards stipulated by the Obama administration.Price Outperformance, Superior Sector RankPerformance of Zacks Finance vs Automotive Sector (From Mar 13   to date)The gap between these two key sectors has become evident over the last week. While the auto sector has managed to inch upward, financials have ended up in the red. This is likely a direct consequence of the Fed's cautious approach toward the path of future rate hikes.Meanwhile, the superior performance of the Auto, Tires and Trucks sector is likely to continue since it is ranked among the top 6% of the 16 Zacks sectors. In contrast, Finance finds itself among the top 38%, which explains the widening gap between the two in terms of performance.Our ChoicesLow fuel prices, burgeoning consumer confidence and Trump's industry friendly approach continue to bode well for the auto sector. In contrast, financials have been weighed down by the Fed's unexpectedly cautious approach toward future rate hikes.A superior sector position is another factor which makes adding auto stocks to your portfolios a prudent option.

3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: General Mills, Inc. (GIS), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Bank of America Corp (BAC);3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market's mixed trading results are filtering down to our daily chart reviews, which are now seeing more diversity in the technical patterns of companies. This suggests that the consolidation or slight decline in the market continues to wither away at the correlation that had supported the strong post-election rally.makeArticleAd();Today, shares ofGeneral Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS),Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) represent the growing diversity of technical reads in the market that are creating opportunities for both the bulls and the bears.General Mills, Inc. (GIS)General Mills' earnings results hit the Street this morning with some disappointment. The consumer food company delivered bottom-line results that were better than expectations while missing on their top-line revenue.GIS shares are trading slightly lower, but the technical crowd should have been taking some warnings on the shares ahead of the earnings call.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeFirst, General Mills' just saw its 50-day cross below the 100-day. There's no fancy term like ""death cross"" for this pattern, just that it signals a continuation in the weakening of the intermediate-term pattern for the price trend.Second, the 50-day moving average has been forcing a lot of pressure on GIS shares. Since breaking below this trendline in February, it has acted as resistance for the shares.We saw a spike in volume ahead of the earnings call, which tells us that there were some technicians that were concerned with the upcoming announcement, but the momentum trade for General Mills is certainly weakened further by the news.Expect to see some stability in the shares as they reach an oversold indication soon, but the trend indicators are suggesting that this consumer staples company is set to continue under performing the market.Tesla Inc (TSLA)As we had predicted before the earnings results, Tesla shares fell to a ""sell the news"" reaction to the earnings results. TSLA shares have seen some strength since the initial decline; however, a more interesting technical situation.The recent rally, which is now rolling over, is forming what could turn out to be a head-and-shoulders pattern. This pattern would have the ""neckline"" for Tesla shares at $260, a price that has been supporting as well as acted as resistance.A break below $260 on any increase in volume will complete the bearish pattern targeting a price of $220 to $240 for TSLA.Bank of America Corp (BAC)Bank of America has ridden the strength in the financials after the election, but recently fell into a laggard role as interest rate uncertainty has affected the financial stocks.BAC shares have rolled over from $26 and are trying to work off an overbought reading from their RSI, but the charts are indicating that a bullish trend even may be on the horizon.Bank of America shares are closing in on their 50-day moving average, which currently sits at $23.92.  The proximity to the round-numbered $24 will help put more impact behind the support that BAC should get from its 50-day.In addition, a break to this price will generate an oversold signal from the stock's RSI, making for three potentially bullish support points for Bank of America shares at $24.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-Hot10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: General Mills, Inc.

Should Facebook Inc Just Buy Snap Inc.?;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) first tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion in 2013, many pundits thoughtSnap Inc.(NYSE:SNAP) should have agreed to the offer. Of course, failing to make the deal hasn't hurt FB stock, and SNAP - which has a $23.2 billion market cap - probably doesn't mind either.makeArticleAd();If Facebook wanted to do the deal now, though, it would be an incredibly expensive acquisition - the biggest in Facebook's 13-year history, even bigger thanWhatsAppin 2014.But it would move a major competitor from the field of battle.Do the positives of getting rid of an irritating competitor help Facebook stock and outweigh the fact that FB would be paying eight to 10 times what it offered SNAP back in 2013?The answer to that question isn't nearly as obvious as investors might think. It really depends on why Facebook wanted Snapchat back in 2013 … and why it would want it today.Facebook and Snapchat: A Brief HistoryWhen Facebook first approached Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel in late 2012, it was, according to Spiegel, to scare him and co-founder Bobby Ryan into selling. Spiegel toldForbesin a 2014 cover-story profile that Mark Zuckerberg warned them: Facebook was going to release its own photo app called Facebook Poke that would blow Snapchat out of the water.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThat didn't happen. In fact,Facebook Poke was an unmitigated disaster.Zuckerberg wanted to buy Snapchat to strengthen its teenage audience, which was slowly drifting away from Facebook. Something like 26% of American kids aged 18-29 was using Snapchat at the time - a remarkably high capture rate in this all-important demographic.Snapchat's co-founders could smell fear on the part of Zuckerberg, but also an opportunity. It's not unlike Zuckerberg saying no to any number of offers over the years for Facebook, several at more than $1 billion during a time when the social media giant didn't have much revenue.Flash forward to the present.Should Facebook Make a Move?Analysts believe that Facebook could still make an offer for Snap despite the fact its valuation is now much more expensive than in 2013. That's because little has changed when it comes to Facebook's glaring weakness: people under the age of 30.""One of the key points that the bears on SNAP may be missing is that we believe that FB would love to acquire the company, and it could be willing to pay at least $20B+ ($14/share) for the asset."" wrote FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi March 9, initiating coverage of the recent IPO. ""Remember that FB paid $21.8B for WhatsApp, a company which, although it had more users than SNAP, was not generating any real revenue.""More importantly, the analyst goes on to remind investors, is that buying Snapchat at the current inflated valuation would eliminate a significant threat to its business. It's the old addition by subtraction argument.And why not?Facebook has $29.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt. It has introduced four different Snapchat clones in the past two years;the latest being Messenger Day, which is thought by social media experts to be a blatant ripoff of Snapchat Stories.The biggest problem for Facebook is finding new places to display ads other than on its flagship app, which is close to capacity. Copycat or not, monetizing its Messenger app would deliver much-needed revenue growth at a time when FB stock really needs to provide investors with some light at the end of the monetization tunnel.So, the question Facebook has to ask itself is whether its internal efforts to copy Snapchat are enough to match or exceed Snap Inc.'s future revenues. If 100% certain that they are, buying Snapchat at any price would be a waste of money.Apple Inc. Launches New Red iPhone 7, New iPadHowever, if the answer is no or Facebook doesn't have a definitive answer, then it's a resounding yes.Bottom Line on FB StockEither way, if you own FB stock, I don't think you should be selling anytime soon regardless of what Facebook decides.My inclination would be to wait and see what happens at Snapchat. After all, it currently doesn't make any money and should things not go as planned over the next 12-24 months, Facebook would be able to buy it for much less at that time.Besides, the guys at Snapchat already said no once. It would be really embarrassing if they said no a second time, given the dollars Facebook would be throwing at them.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and BeyondIs Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Worth the Risk?10 Mutual Funds You Can Buy and Hold ForeverThe postShould Facebook Inc Just Buy Snap Inc.?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Finding Big-Time Resistance at $266;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe recent enthusiasm that yet another capital raiseTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was smaller and less dilutive (for now) than anticipated appears to have waned considerably. TSLA stock appears to have found considerable resistance heading appreciably higher and I look for Tesla to continue to flounder over the coming weeks.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs I have mentioned in my recent posts on TSLA stock (bullish here,bearish here), any fundamental analysis on Tesla borders on ludicrous. TSLA is a stock driven on faith, with that faith best being manifested in technical analysis.From a technical perspective, Tesla is hard up against some major resistance at the $266 level. Over the past three days, Tesla has tried to break through this level only to be rejected. This post earnings gap has certainly proved to be daunting resistance.Implied volatility (IV) analysis also points to a high degree of complacency, normally a reliable contrarian indicator. Previous instances when TSLA stock traded at such trough levels of IV proved to be meaningful highs in the price of Tesla shares.While I mentioned that fundamental analysis in TSLA is basically futile, that still doesn't stop the top analysts from issuing some fundamental research.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotGoldman Sachs, which was the lead underwriter on the latest capital raise with TSLA stock at the $260 level, has a$185 price target. That's right, $185!! UBS has a sell rating and a$160 price target. Deutsche Bank is a believer, thinking that Tesla can eventually rival BMW and Mercedes, causing them toraise their price target from $220 to $240. So that's three major houses thinking TSLA is overpriced.Every major house also expects more and more capital raises down the road, especially as recent acquisitionSolarCity'sbonds come due. So with the initial euphoria of the ""not as bad as we thought"" rally wearing off, now is a very opportune time to take a short position in TSLA. Since IV is at such depressed levels, a simple put purchase makes intuitive sense.TSLA Stock Trade IdeaBuy to open TSLA April $260 puts for $9.These are the traditional monthly options. Maximum loss is $900 per contract. The trade is net short 45 deltas at trade inception, equating to 45 shares of stock short.Since the position is a simple long option play, it is crucial to monitor time decay. I would revisit the position at the end of the month to make any necessary adjustments.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Stock Is an Easy Short;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAdobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) rallied sharply last week after the company reported its latest financial results. However, through the lens of chart analysis, this rally has pushed ADBE stock to its limits on the upside. Now, chasing it higher sounds like a low-probability strategy.makeArticleAd();In fact, active traders now have some good risk-to-reward for Adobe trades on the short side.It has been a while since I've seen a setup like the one in ADBE stock, but when I do find one of these specific high-probability setups, I try to write about it here in this daily column o' mine.The setup in specific is what I refer to as the ""gravity pull"" setup, and it refers to stocks that have gone into vertical overshooting mode where they took an already steep uptrend into a vertical leap higher.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotAs we will see on the two charts of Adobe stock below, when I come across a stock setup like this, my go-to strategy is to either short the stock, buy cheap put options or option spreads, or if implied volatility is high enough, I will even consider selling out-of-the-money call spreads.ADBE Stock ChartsOn the multiyear chart, we see that ADBE stock over the past few years has traded steadily higher in a well-defined uptrend, which apart from a couple of swings below trend in 2014, 2015 and 2016, managed to hold very well.Click to EnlargeStarting in late November 2016, Adobe embarked on a new rally leg that by January/early February broke the stock decisively above and out of the longer-standing multiyear uptrend.This move alone is ultimately likely to lead to a correction phase that should retest the upper end of the multiyear uptrend.On the daily chart, I highlighted this recent multimonth rally with the two black lines which some may label as a rising wedge formation that ultimately may correct lower.Click to EnlargeLast Friday, following the earnings announcement - in which Adobe reported results that were largely better than what investors had expected - ADBE stock gapped higher and rallied even further.3 Stocks to Watch on Tuesday: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Nike Inc (NKE) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX)As a result, it broke above the steep multi-month rally and literally took the chart into vertical rally mode.From here, active investors and traders could consider shorting Adobe stock or buying cheap puts or puts spreads, using the $130 area as a stop-loss and the low $120s as a first downside price target.Option sellers could even consider selling out-of-the-money call spreads on the stock, although in my eyes, implied volatility is too low to warrant this strategy.Like what you see?

3 Stocks to Watch on Tuesday: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Nike Inc (NKE) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX);3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNOTE: This story has been updated to include new Apple product launches.makeArticleAd();The U.S. stock market kicked off the week with a slight limp on Monday, as a meager earnings slate was unable to do any real pushing or shoving. As a result, theS&P 500finished 0.1% lower, theDow Jones Industrial Averageslipped marginally and theNasdaqmanaged to creep a basis point ahead.No, Monday was a light-volume day with investor interest more focused on the goings-on in Washington, where FBI Director James Comey discussed President Donald Trump's allegations of wiretapping against former President Barack Obama, and addressed a pending investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. But this morning, the spotlight reverts back to Wall Street, withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Nike Inc(NYSE:NKE) andFreeport-McMoRan Inc(NYSE:FCX) all getting some attention.Here's what you need to pay attention to today.Apple Inc. (AAPL)This morning, anyone visiting the Apple Store has been greeted with the following:Most AAPL followers shouldn't be terribly surprised at this, if only because it's been rumored for some time now thatApple would reveal new iPads soon. The thought was that at the very least, a new iPad Pro would be on the way, and a new Macbook could also be in the lineup.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotVenerable Apple rumors purveyor MacRumors notes:""The timing of the downtime is notable given that Apple is rumored tolaunch new products as early as this week. Moreover, Apple commonly issues press releases at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, which is exactly when the so-called ""maintenance"" update is scheduled to be completed.""And MacRumors was on the ball - it was a setup for some new products.Apple released ""RED"" special edition iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. The phones will be available in 128GB and 256GB versions. The new phones will go on sale March 24, and begin at $749.Apple also unleashed a cheaper, $329 model iPad with 32 GB of memory and Wi-Fi capability.The $459 model will have the same memory and Wi-Fi, but also cellular capability.Apple now has a new app called ""Clips"" that let users create videos to be shared via Instant Messenger, as well as various social apps.AAPL is up fractionally in response.Nike Inc (NKE)NKE shares are headed higher in anticipation of the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report, out this afternoon.Nike, which struggled mightily in 2016, and in fact was the worst-performing stock in the Dow, is rebounding well this year, up 15% year-to-date.What's in store this quarter?Analysts expect NKE to earn 53 cents per share on revenues of $8.47 billion. That would be 2 cents lower on the profit side, but a gain of 5.4% year-over-year on the top line. And the company is pretty reliable come earnings time, not having missed a profit estimate in years.Our James Brumley takesa closer look at Nike's upcoming earnings report.Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX)FCX shares are getting a nice bump in Tuesday's trade thanks to an upgrade from Deutsche Bank.3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and BeyondDB analyst Chris Terry has bumped FCX stock up from ""Sell"" to ""Hold,"" and also ginned up the price target from $12.50 to $14.00 - a modest 10% higher from here. He says:""NPV increases to $14.2/sh (from $12.6) on higher copper prices; PT raised to $14 (from $12.5) @ 1.0x NPV, implying 4.7x 2018E EBITDA. Hold rating (from Sell) on balanced risk/reward view.""Freeport has a little bit more new on the copper front, too: Its important Freeport Indonesia unit has resumed production at its Grasberg mine,a spokesman has told Reuters. The mine's copper concentrate production has been shut down since Feb. 11 ""after Indonesia prevented it from exporting the material used to make refined copper, and its sole domestic buyer halted operations due to a strike.""FCX shares are up 3% this morning, which should get shares close to breakeven this morning.Kyle Woodleyis the Managing Editor ofInvestorPlace.com.

Cooper Tire & Rubber Co (CTB) Stock Is A Classic Mid-Cap Value;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor the past three years, I've driven an SUV and a pickup. I got an unbelievable deal on the pickup (I always buy used), but it needed new tires.makeArticleAd();When I took the truck to the friendly neighborhood tire guys to replace them with similar all-terrain tires, I then understood why they were so friendly and why the truck was such a good deal. Ouch.I'm not alone. Currently, light trucks and SUVs represent 63% of 2016's record year for U.S. vehicle sales, which came in at 17.55 million. Three years ago, the truck and SUV share of auto sales was right at 50%.As far as cars on the road in the United States, the average age of a vehicle in the light truck/SUV category is around 6.1 years. Eventually, tens of millions of tires will be replaced to the tune of $800 to $1,400 a set.That's why I'm looking atCooper Tire and Rubber Company(NYSE:CTB).Cooper is the number five tire manufacturer in North America and number twelve worldwide, with 2016 sales of $2.92 billion. Why do I want to buy the middle of the pack? First, the stock is a genuine value with attractive internal metrics that position it for price appreciation. Second, the company makes an attractive takeover target.The valuation metrics make a compelling case on their own. Currently, the stock trades with a forward P/E of 11.45, a 37% discount to the S&P 500 on a forward P/E basis. When pundits complain that there's no real value in the current market, they'll get no sympathy. You can ALWAYS find value versus the benchmark!The internal numbers are just as intriguing. Price-to-sales sits at an undervalued 0.8. Long-term debt-to-capitalization is at a comfortable 28.8% - not bad for an industrial manufacturer. The most impressive number, however, is the return on equity (ROE) of 24.17%. Historically, analysts consider a consistent ROE of 15-20% attractive. Cooper Tire regularly beats that average by 20%.Going forward, the company expects to grow sales at an average annual rate of 6.5% over the next two years. The best opportunity to do this lies with the company's international efforts. A full 85% of Cooper's annual sales are from North America. Clearly, emerging markets in Asia and Latin America will be the key drivers.The attractive metrics are also what make Cooper an acquisition candidate…After the company's failed merger with British tire maker Apollo Tyre in 2013, the most likely suitor would be Germany'sContinental AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:CTTAY). AReutersstory from October 2016 alluded to Continental's interest in acquiring market share in the replacement tire market.While Continental holds the number four spot globally for tire manufacturers, Continental and Cooper both hold a 7% share of the North American market. Continental's $40.2 billion market makes a $2.2 billion acquisition of Cooper Tire an easy hurdle to clear and a relatively cheap path to doubling share in the all-important North American market.Risks To Consider:The largest risk Cooper faces is its thin share of its primary market. It's ability to grow share organically hampered by its mid-cap status in the face of its large cap peers. However, management has faced this challenge through successful execution and keeping the balance sheet healthy.Action To Take:As a standalone investment, CTB shares are classic mid-cap value. The company chugs along, executes dependably, and has paid a dividend for 180 consecutive quarters (that's 45 years in civilian talk). The company is equally attractive as a takeover target for a larger, international manufacturer looking to grow North American market share.3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and BeyondThe stock currently trades around $43 with a forward P/E of 11.45 and a dividend yield just shy of 1%. Based on management's consistent track record, a 12-month price target of $50 is reasonable. A takeover target price is a bit more difficult to determine. However, my conservative guess would be a premium of 20-25% over the current price. Either way, investors are poised to benefit.Editor's Note:This isthe most boring chartyou'll see all year.

The search engine giant is as relevant as ever, and its targeted advertising model is a favorite for advertisers and marketing teams.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNear a yearly high and at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 31 times, the company faces no headwinds. Competition fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is hardly a concern, even after GOOGL's weak Google+ offering.Alphabet's Electronic Money BusinessGoogle's Gmail for the web now allows for sending money from within the Android app. This could threatenPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL).For now, though, PayPal need not worry. Google users may not even know about this money-transferring features. PayPal's branding is so solid that it, along with investors, should not expect an erosion in its business. So, Google Wallet, and evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, have too little of the market share in electronic payments at this time.Still, GOOGL's foray in this business is a necessity. It cannot rely entirely on advertising for all of its revenue.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsDespite Google and Facebook dominating the digital advertising space, Google's reliance on ad clicks is a clear risk. In the fourth quarter, the company faced higher hardware costs, as itinvestedin the new Pixel phone, Daydream View Virtual Reality and Google Home.But the good news is that Google's revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to $26.06 billion allows the company to invest. Investors are hardly worried: the stock bottomed at the $800 per share range on Feb. 1 and has surged over $860 a share.Increasing ad content to grow profit margins brings risks for GOOGL shareholders. Google's search results will worsen if it continues pushing too many paid ads or its own services before it connects the user to the proper search results. Just do a search for a ""car,"" The search results display at least five ads before the useful results show up below them. On the desktop, this is not entirely unusable because the user gets the results on one screen. On mobile, the ads add to scrolling time for the user. The more frustrating the user experience, the more likely users will start abandoning Google.com in favor ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing or DuckDuckGo.Growth in MobileGoogle's focus on high-end hardware, notably the Google Pixel phone, ensures the company is at the forefront of mobile. Google Assistant is the key software solution in the hardware. And it lets GOOGL stock continue its development in AI solutions. Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's Siri are the competitors to the Assistant.Pixel is still in the early phases of hardware development. Since Google puts an emphasis on the user experience, future iterations will only offer a better experience. So this will result in users spending more time using Assistant, Google Search, and other Google apps:""In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users. Our thesis is that as we make it easier for users to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing and including many modes whether they are typing or asking Google a question, we find that it overall benefits.""Source:SA TranscriptTrading GOOGL StockHaving the highest weighting with GOOGL stock may lead to a 3.6% total return in 30 days.3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and BeyondThis company as the only tech holding in a portfolio is enough to give investors a healthy exposure to the sector.Source:WhoTrades StrategyAlphabet does not have any major headwinds ahead.

How Many Vehicles Will Tesla, Inc. Deliver in Q1?;3/20/2017;"Next week,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will close its first quarter. That means the   electric-car maker will soon share its total quarterly vehicle   deliveries.Ahead of Tesla's first-quarter update on vehicle deliveries,   here's a close look at what investors know.Tesla vehicles outside of Tesla factory. Image source:     Author.makeArticleAd();A wildcard quarterTypically, Tesla investors have some solid visibility into   potential vehicle deliveries for a given quarter. But there's   much more uncertainty surrounding this quarter's possible   deliveries than usual, as Tesla opted to only provide guidance   for the first half of the year -- without specifying what it   expects for the first quarter.For the first half of the year, Tesla said it expects to   deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined,   up 62% to 72% compared to same period in 2016.Investors also know that Tesla ended its fourth quarter with a   record 6,450 vehicles in transit to customers, setting the   company up for a strong start to the quarter. Tesla also said   demand for its vehicles is looking up; orders for the Model S and   Model X combined were up 49% year over year and were 24% higher   than any other quarter, management said.But even this information still leaves lots of room for   guesswork since quarterly deliveries can also be influenced by   the timing of shipments to different regions, as well as by   production challenges. The best ballpark figure investors can   arrive at for estimating Model S and Model X deliveries in the   first quarter, therefore, is one that simply cuts Tesla's   forecast for the first half of the year in half. Assuming Tesla   delivers half of its 47,000 to 50,000 estimated units for the   first half of the year in Q1, it would imply 23,500 to 25,000   deliveries during the quarter -- up from 22,252 deliveries in the   fourth quarter of 2016 and 14,820 units in the first quarter of   2016.Investors should look for Tesla's first-quarter deliveries to   be between about 23,500 and 25,000. But since this estimate is   extrapolated from guidance for a broader period, investors   shouldn't be surprised if actual deliveries deviate from this   estimate. If deliveries do come in below or above this level,   investors may want to look into a reason for the variance.Look for an update on demandBeyond Tesla's reported deliveries in its upcoming update,   which is usually released within three calendar days of the   quarter's close (anywhere between April 1 and April 3), investors   may want to look for an update on demand for Model S and Model   X.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.In Tesla's quarterly update on deliveries, the company has   recently been sharing data for orders of the two vehicles. In its   update on fourth-quarter deliveries, for instance, investors   learned that Model S and Model X deliveries were increasing   sharply year over year and were at an all-time high.A look at demand levels for Model S and Model X during the   first quarter would be timely since Tesla is preparing to bring   to market its $35,000 Model 3 in the second half of the year.   With a starting price about half of Tesla's more expensive Model   S and Model X, there's good reason to be concerned about Model 3   cannibalizing sales of Tesla's two older, pricier models.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Buy Because of Their Eccentric CEOs;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen deciding which stocks to add to your portfolio, it's important to assess things like a company's financials, its growth plans and who its competitors are.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrHowever, most investors also put a lot of stake into a company's upper management because they are, after all, the ones calling the shots. CEOs have a lot of sway over a company's future, so many investors keep a close eye on who is at the helm and how they're impacting the firm's bottom line.The management style of a firm's CEO is an important factor in its success and while calm, cool and collected tends to be the most desirable trait to investors, there are a few eccentric CEOs that are just crazy enough to make things work.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotElon Musk ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), Jeff Bezos ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and Michael O'Leary ofRyanair Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:RYAAY) are three such CEOs whose out-of-the-box personalities have brought their respective firms a great deal of success.Eccentric CEOs: Elon Musk,Tesla Inc (TSLA)As CEO and founder of electric car company Tesla, Elon Musk, is one of the first people that comes to mind when thinking about mega-successful eccentric CEOs.Musk is well known using colorful language and not shying away from speaking his mind, especially when it comes to talking about competitors. However, while Mr. Musk can sometimes becontroversial, you've got to give it to him for thinking big and executing those plans. His decision to create a TSLA Gigafactory in Nevada appears to be paying off.According to Musk, Tesla is on-track to build 500,000 new vehicles in 2018.Eccentric CEOs: Jeff Bezos,Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Jeff Bezos is the CEO and founder of e-commerce giant Amazon and although he flies a bit further under the radar than Musk, he still found himself at the center of controversy when the corporate culture at AMZN came under fire last year.Former employees claimed that intense pressure and competition made their working environment unbearable, but Bezosshot backsaying that his firm's culture promotes risk-taking and sets high standards, which is a key reason why Amazon has been so successful.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeWhether you agree with the way AMZN treats its employees, you've got to admit that whatever they're doing over there, it's working. Amazon has created an undeniably exceptional service that has hooked millions of people. The company's continued expansion and innovation makes Amazon an attractive stock to buy and hold and Bezos' high expectations should give shareholders confidence in the company's future.Eccentric CEOs: Michael O'Leary, Ryanair Holdings plc (ADR) (RYAAY)Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is perhaps one of the most polarizing CEOs on the planet. You either loathe or love his outlandish remarks and no-holds-barred comments, and I fall in the latter camp.O'Leary doesn't shy away from having an opinion and he has always been upfront about RYAAY's mission - safety and profits, profits, profits. While many have criticized his intensecost-cutting measures, the airline has become synonymous with low-cost flights. O'Leary's willingness to speak unfiltered to the press has given the airline a lot of free publicity.RYAAY has done well because of that- the company was able to thrive despite a financial crisis in Europe and has grown to become one of the largest airlines in the world. The company's profits have been nothing short of impressive over the last few quarters, and although the impact of the Brexit is likely to take its toll, RYAAY is likely to weather this storm successfully.Love him or hate him, O'Leary delivers for shareholders and his flamboyant remarks are constantly generating buzz for Ryanair.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long RYAAY and AMZN.The post3 Stocks to Buy Because of Their Eccentric CEOsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and Beyond;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is going to $500. At least, that's the word according to Iou1000, a message board participant at Seeking Alpha. ""Again the shorts need a bear [market] or something untoward happening to Elon Musk to make money - Otherwise Tesla will make a new high on the way to 500,""Iou1000commented on TSLA stock on March 20, 2017.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)TSLA stock closed trading Mar. 17 at $261.50, 91.2% less than $500, halfway to a G-note. Assuming the prediction is on the money - when does it get there, and more importantly, how?There are three answers to this question, in my opinion, the first being the best option for TSLA stock blowing past $500 on its way to $1,000.TSLA Needs to Be ProfitableIt's a simple concept but one that investors have grappled with since TSLA stock startedtradingon June 29, 2010. Since then, it has amassed $2.4 billion in operating losses and $17 billion in revenue. That's an average of $343 million in annual operating losses and $2.4 billion in annual revenue for a 14.2% negative operating margin.It has never made money on an annual basis, not even with the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credits it sells from time to time as a result of producing emission-free vehicles. In Q3 2016 it did make a $0.71 per share non-GAAP profit, but that included$139 millionin ZEV credits sold during the quarter. Without the ZEV credits according to UBS lead auto analyst Colin Langan, it would have been a $0.18 loss.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeFuture earnings are what ultimately drive stock prices.If Tesla could simply generate positive free cash flow on an annual basis, it would be more than enough ammunition for the bulls that TSLA stock was worth owning at $500 and beyond. Of course, it doesn't - negative free cash flow in 2016 of$1.4 billion- hence the line in its 2016 10-K:""Until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows, we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles.""That's exactly what Tesla did recently when it raised$1.2 billionin cash - $350 million in new equity and $850 million in senior convertible notes - to pad the amount of capital available to bring the Model 3 to production.Blowing past $500 would be a lot more of a sure thing if it started making some kind of a GAAP-like profit. Until then, you're going to have a lot of skeptics. That's just the nature of the beast.TSLA Stock Is a Winner If Model 3 Is a SuccessThe honeymoon is over.Elon Musk has said that it will produce5,000Model 3s' per week in the fourth quarter of 2017, ramping up to 10,000 per week in 2018. At 400,000 pre-orders it will likely fill that pent-up demand sometime in 2019.Skeptics point out that Tesla has only delivered 183,000 vehicles over the last five years, making this kind of production increase fraught with risk. If Tesla can't meet the pre-order demand in a timely fashion, the odds of the Model 3 becoming a big commercial success decrease exponentially putting significant downward pressure on TSLA stock and ultimately, Tesla's long-term viability.""While we are bullish about Tesla's long-term potential, we have several near term concerns, most notably (1) gross margins, as Model 3 and its associated capex ramps up, and (2) Tesla's overall customer experience - which we believe is not strong today - and could be further pressured as the company migrates to selling to a more mass-market consumer,"" a Bernstein analyst recentlywrotein a note to investors. ""A poor ramp and customer experience on Model 3 could not only impact Tesla's near-term financials, but undermine the franchise longer-term.""The positive in all of this is that Tesla is said to be already making ""release candidate"" versions of theModel 3, eliminating the costly ""prototype"" phase, which suggests the company's ability to get concept vehicles into production in a timely manner will continue to improve in the future. This bodes well for its future vehicles and the Model 3.Model YCar companies are known to use a single platform to produce several different vehicles in one production facility. Tesla is said to be introducing itsModel Ycrossover SUV sometime in 2018; it's a vehicle that could be built on the same platform as the Model 3. If so, the cost of producing the Model Y would drop significantly helping to point its way toward GAAP profitability and automotive mass production.BofA Thinks FireEye, Inc. (FEYE) Stock Has 70% Upside. Here's Why.We don't even know if the Model 3 is going to be a hit, but a smooth rollout later in 2017 should pave the way for strong demand of the Model Y.Bottom Line on Tesla StockIn December, IsuggestedTesla stock belonged in one's IRA, albeit that it shouldn't represent more than 5% of your plan. The reason: TSLA stock is still a risk despite all the good things happening at the company.Frankly, I think Tesla stock gets to $500 by this time next year, because by then we'll know if the Model 3 is a success or failure. When it starts making money, and that's a bigif, $1,000 will look like chump change in the scheme of things.Unfortunately, there's a lot of water to go under the bridge yet. If you're long, I'd stay long. If you're short, good luck to you, and if you don't own TSLA stock, I wouldn't get overly aggressive in your purchases until its future is a little more clear.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThe post3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and Beyondappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Inc (TSLA) to Stop Selling Cheapest Model S;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) will stop selling the cheapest versions of its Models S next month.makeArticleAd();Source: TeslaTesla Inc will stop selling the Model S 60 and 60D on April 16, 2017. These versions of the Model S come with a 75 kWh battery that is limited to 60 kWh by software restrictions. The company says that most customers chose to buy the additional upgrade that unlocks the full 75 kWh.Due to most customers choosing toupgrade to the 75 kWh option, Tesla Inc is removing the Model S 60 and 60D from its list of available vehicles next month. This decision comes as TSLA prepares to launch its next electric vehicle, the Model 3.The Tesla Model 3 is expected to only cost around $35,000 and may include a battery pack below 60kWh. However, the test version of vehicle that the company has is powered by a 70kWh battery pack. The cheapest version of the Model S was priced at $68,000 and its removal may mean the company is making room for the new Model 3, reportsElectrek.""We introduced the Model S 60 kWh battery as a more affordable option to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles,"" Tesla Inc toldSeeking Alpha.

Tesla (TSLA) to Discontinue Model S 60 Sale from April;3/20/2017;"Tesla, Inc.TSLAhas recently mailed its customers informing them of the discontinuation of the sale of the entry level Model S vehicle, according to sources. The company has decided to remove the Model S 60 and 60D from its lineup. The last day to buy the 60 kWh version has been set at Apr 16, 2017. Post the date, the entry level Model S sedan will be S 75 and 75D, priced $6,500 higher. Late last year, the company had raised the price of its Model S vehicles by $2,000.A Cheaper Model STesla had introduced Model S 60 and 60D versions last year. The cheaper version was introduced as the company experienced a higher-than-expected demand for Model 3 as well as immediate demand for a more affordable Model S. These versions were introduced to boost sales which in turn would encourage the adoption of electric cars. The Model S 60 kWh version has the same battery as the 75 kWh version. However, a software limits the battery usage to 80%. Customers have the option to upgrade the battery to utilize the entire capacity by unlocking the software for $9,500.During the introduction of this version, Tesla had expected demand for Model S to increase and subsequently the customers would also pay for unlocking of the 60 kWh version for the addition 15 kWh. The company expected gross margins for the sale of the locked version to be 15−20%. However, if customers unlocked the software, the margin was expected to rise to the mid-20% range.Tesla has claimed that most customers who purchased the Model S 60 kWh version unlocked the software to 75 kWh. To ease the ordering process for consumers, the company has decided to eliminate the 60 kWh version. Another reason for the removal of the version from the company's vehicle lineup could also be to boost the gross margins if the rate of upgradation fell short of expectations.Model 3 on the CardsThe announcement comes at a time when Tesla is preparing to begin production of the Model 3, which will be the company's most affordable vehicle. The price of the model will be less than half of the new entry level Model S. Model 3 is expected to have a battery smaller than 60 kWh but versions offering higher performance will be priced more.The discontinuation of the 60 kWh Model S also widens the gap between the two models, which would differentiate Model S as a higher-end model. Moreover, customers would be less confused about the model choice owing to a significant price difference between the two.A Rerun of EventsEarlier, Tesla had taken similar decisions on its Model X SUV. The company introduced a cheaper 60 kWh Model X version, with limited battery usage from the 75 kWh by a software which could be upgraded. However, four months after the introduction of the version it was discontinued.The removal of the more affordable Model X increased the base price of the vehicle from $74,000 to $88,800 per unit.PerformancemakeArticleAd();Tesla has outperformed the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry over the last three months.

BofA Thinks FireEye, Inc. (FEYE) Stock Has 70% Upside. Here’s Why.;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFireEye, Inc.(NASDAQ:FEYE) is flying high Monday morning on an upgrade from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. FEYE stock got a 6%-plus pop as BofA shares a ""Buy"" rating and an $18 price target - a whopping 70% better than Friday's close.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)It's hard to be inspired right now. Bearishness has been rightfully high because valuations - relative to future growth - are unfavorable. Management shuffling and a light forecast from FEYE also suggests that FireEye will have limited upside for investors in the near-term.But BofA sees what I see - that in the long-term, FEYE stock could pan out.The FundamentalsLast month, FireEye reported flat (year-over-year) fourth-quarter revenue growth of $184.7 million. Operating margins improved to -1%. The company forecast Q1 revenue of as low as $160 million, while analysts expected FEYE would generate $177 million in revenue.8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market CrashThe company clearly is in a turnaround phase, but until the sales team transition stabilizes, short-term pains in FEYE stockwillcontinue.Last quarter, FireEye revenues suffered due to the limited release of new products. Its sales team had vacancies that needed filling, leaving a massive gap in leadership. But the company had no head of sales for the worldwide or Europe divisions. The company's Middle East and Japan units underwent sales management transitions, too.The impact on results is very clear: FireEye did not meet analyst expectations.Investors may anticipate sales improving sometime in the next few quarters, depending on the productivity of the new sales team. Fixing the internal sales process will result in better profitability. On its conference call, FEYE management said:We are also working across the board to minimize the number of deals that go through our non-standard pricing process, or NSP process, so partners can control their margin and shorten their sales cycle.FEYE has a believable plan to turn around and restructure its sales division. The problem is simply one of timing.FireEye ValuationWith the stock price hovering near yearly lows, some, if not all, of the risks of a failed turnaround are priced into FireEye shares.By assuming a discount rate of between 11.5%-12.5%, FEYE stock is worth 12.5% more than current levels. Conversely, if revenue continues falling, the fair value based on future cash flow implies a lower share price. BofA doesn't see that as happening, though.""We think the Street largely ignores management's guidance for growth resumption in 2H17, which is an opportunity for a positive surprise,"" says analyst Tal Liani.There's headline support here, too. The demand levels for cybersecurity solutions is unpredictable. Whenever the public hears about a security breach, though, the news drives the stock price up. Markets anticipate that companies addressing security holes will buy solutions from FEYE.Bank of America seems to back that up, saying that FireEye's threat intelligence is the most advanced offering out there. From the note:""FireEye's core value proposition is centered around having some of the most advanced threat intelligence that lends its value to three areas of innovation: dealing with network threats, strong position in endpoint protection and above all is the value of analytics and threat management.""Product DevelopmentFireEye's public, hybrid and private cloud security solutions are among the bricks upon which FEYE stock could be built back up.Bank of America seems to back that up, saying that FireEye's threat intelligence is the most advanced offering out there. From the note:""FireEye's core value proposition is centered around having some of the most advanced threat intelligence that lends its value to three areas of innovation: dealing with network threats, strong position in endpoint protection and above all is the value of analytics and threat management.""The Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid enhances endpoint security for customers, FireEye Helix unifies the security experience for organizations. By offering a lower cost of ownership and cutting operational expenses for customers, Helix may reverse FEYE's weakening business.Why I Sold Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock (And You Should Too)BofA lists ""New products: cloud MVX, Smart grid, Helix, enhancements to FireEye-as-a-Service and the next gen endpoints"" as one of its bullish arguments.Adobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) are great examples of companies moving from out-of-the-box software sales and towards cloud subscriptions. Revenue growth is slow at first, but when it picks up, profitability soars.Radcom Ltd.(NASDAQ:RDCM), a supplier of quality assurance solutions for the telecom industry, also moved towards a subscription model with great success.Bottom Line on FEYE StockLast month, rumors thatSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) would buy FireEye proved short-lived. Symantec is already absorbingBluecoatSystems. It does not need the operational risks related to adding FEYE's cybersecurity solution to its suite of products.Still, FireEye does offer detection capabilities. Even if it's not a right match for Symantec, though, it's priced cheaply enough that it could be easily ingested by many conglomerate tech stocks.FireEye's mini-rallies hold some truth: The market views the company's potential are still unrealized. A buyout would unlock the value of the company.Better yet, having a stabilized sales team with lower turnover and developing new cloud-based products will reverse the downtrend in its stock.FEYE stock is a buy, though the real upside potential (70% or not) could take a bit to reach.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGeneral Electric Company (GE): Should Nelson Peltz Just Quit?Monday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Tesla Inc.

Ahead of Its Model 3, Tesla to Discontinue Cheapest Model S Version;3/19/2017;"In emails sent to customers last week, electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) warned potential customers interested in its base   60 kilowatt-hour Model S -- which is the cheapest version of the   fully-electric sedan available and has a starting price of   $68,000 -- that April 16 would be the last day to order the   vehicle.A discontinuation of the 60-kWh Model S would increase the   pricing gap between Tesla's upcoming $35,000 Model 3 and Tesla's   pricier Model S -- a move that would help further distinguish the   Model S as a higher-end option for customers.Model S. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();The 60 kWh variant's spotty historyTesla's 60 kilowatt-hour Model S has a rollercoaster   history.As one of Tesla's initial battery configurations available for   customers to choose when Model S was first launched in 2012, the   battery capacity was ditched in 2015 fora new 70 kWh entry-level Model S.Last summer, however, Teslabrought back the lower-capacity option, as customers reportedly expressed interest in buying the   vehicle if the price were slightly lower. The value proposition   was arguably more aggressive when Tesla brought back the 60 kWh   Model S. This variant actually sported a 75 kWh battery, which   customers could upgrade to via a software update for a fee at any   time.And now Tesla is ditching the 60 kWh variant yet again. The   company says the move was made because most customers were   upgrading to the 75 kWh version anyway. Furthermore, by removing   the upgradeable 60 kWh option, Tesla says it will ""simplify the   ordering process"" for its customers.Is Model 3 the real reason?But there's also good reason to believe the discontinuation of   a 60 kWh Model S could have just as much to do with Tesla's   upcoming Model 3. With the company planning to begin production   of the lower-priced version in July, a fully optioned Model 3   could easily come close to Tesla's $68,000 starting price for   Model S, creating some confusing choices for customers.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.For instance, if Tesla charges an additional $10,000 on top of   the Model 3's $35,000 base price for a larger battery capacity   option, and if customers pay for Enhanced and opt for about   $15,000 worth of additional upgrade options, this could easily   get a highly optioned Model 3's price close the base 60 kWh Model   S. And if Tesla offers several battery upgrade options, Model 3   pricing could rise to $70,000 or more.As Tesla's planned production for Model 3 approaches, the   company likely wants to be sure that Model S is differentiated   from the Model 3 as a higher-end option. While the larger overall   size of the Model S will likely play an important role in   differentiation, Tesla will probably need more factors than this   to truly set the vehicle apart as the company's flagship   sedan.Looking ahead, Tesla expects Model 3 to help total annual   vehicle production rise from about 80,000 units in 2016 to   500,000 units in 2018. While management has said it expects Model   3 to drive most of this growth, there's no indication it expects   the more expensive Model S and Model X sales to fall as Model 3   deliveries take off. It's likely, therefore, that Tesla will make   significant efforts to further differentiate its Model S from   Model 3 as production ramps up. The discontinuation of Tesla's 60   kWh Model S is likely just the first of many such moves.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Inc.'s Capital Expenditures Could Soar Nearly 200% This Year;3/18/2017;"On Thursday, electric-car companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) followed through on CEO Elon Musk's recent   commentary regarding a likelycapital raise to reduce riskassociated with rapidly increasing spending for its ambitious   growth plans. Tesla said it would raiseabout $1.15 billion.As Tesla raises cash in preparation for a big jump in   spending, it's a good time to take a look at how much the   company's capital expenditures could go up this year.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: Author.makeArticleAd();Big plans, lots of cashIt's no surprise that Tesla needs a lot of capital. The   company has some very ambitious plans for Model 3. With the help   of a higher-volume, lower-priced Model 3, management expects its   annualized production to increase from about 100,000 units today   to a whopping 500,000 units in 2018.But exactly how much cash will Tesla need? A lot more than it   did last year. Here's what we know.With plans to begin production of its upcoming Model 3 in   July, Tesla expects capital spending during the first half of the   year to rise sharply as it lays the groundwork for production.   Management guided for $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital   expenditures in the first half of the year alone -- an amount   that easily trumps the $1.3 billion it spent during the entire   year of 2016 on capital expenditures.What about the second half of the year? While Tesla didn't   provide guidance for expected capital expenditures then, since   management is focused primarily on initial investments   required to get its upcoming Model 3 to volume production, Musk   did recently imply that Tesla anticipates spending to come down   during the second half of the year.Here's what he said during the fourth-quarter earnings   call:I mean, there's obviously going to be ... incremental     investment to go from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week,     but it's going to be a lot less than getting to 5,000 cars a     week in the first place. We don't know exactly what that's     going to be except I'm confident it will be less ...Musk went on to conclude he wouldn't expect capital spending   in the second half of the year to exceed 70% of its spending   during the first half. Therefore, assuming spending in the second   half of the year maxes out at about 70% of spending during the   first half, investors can arrive at a ballpark estimate for   Tesla's total capital spending in 2017: approximately $3.825   billion -- up an incredible 194% compared to capital   expenditures in 2016.Gigafactory and Model 3 are Tesla's biggest     investmentsHow will this spending be allocated? Unsurprisingly, mostly on   investments related to ramping up production of Model 3 (and   batteries for the Model 3 at the Gigafactory).Tesla Gigafactory as of Jan. 3. Image source: TeslaAs CFO Jason Wheeler explained during Tesla's fourth-quarter   earnings call:So we don't break down and we don't disclose the specifics     here, but obviously, Gigafactory and Model 3 are going to be     the biggest investments. We've also got CapEx investments in     equipment and tooling related to Model 3.

Tesla Model S Prices Are About to Go Up;3/18/2017;"Following a $2,000 price bump in November, the price ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S is about to go up even further. That's   because the company is preparing to discontinue the current   entry-level 60 kWh model, including both the single-motor version   as well as the dual-motor version that costs an extra $5,000.   Tesla has sent out emails notifying customers of the change, andElectrekconfirmed the plans with Tesla. The last day that prospective   customers can purchase the 60 kWh version will be April 16,   2017.Tesla says it is making the change because most customers   subsequently purchase the upgrade to a 75 kWh battery, which is   unlocked via a software update, and the company is streamlining   the ordering process. Assuming no other pricing changes, the   single motor 75 kWh Model S starts at $74,500.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Following in Model X's footstepsThe discontinuation of the Model S 60 comes shortly after   Tesla made similar moves with the Model X last year. The   electric-car maker introduced a more affordable 60 kWh version of   its Model X SUV (only available in dual motor) in July 2016,   which was similarly a 75 kWh battery pack that was   software-limited to 60 kwh and started at $74,000. That variant   didn't last long, as it was discontinued in October 2016, just   four months later. Tesla never provided an official reason. The   Model X 75D starts at $88,800.The software-limited 60 kWh Model S lasted a bit longer, as it   was also introduced slightly earlier than the comparable Model X,   but it appears to be following in the Model X's footsteps.Why is Tesla doing this?The software-limited approach has been controversial from the   very beginning. On one hand, there was initial backlash at the   idea that customers were being needlessly prohibited from   accessing the full battery capacity of a product they had paid   for. On the other hand, they paid a lot less for a software   limited 60 kWh pack.From Tesla's perspective, there was a certain amount of risk   associated with the approach, since it was still including 75 kWh   of capacity, which comes at a cost. The hope was that the lower   price point would attract more buyers, who would later upgrade.   If the customer is content with 60 kWh and never upgrades, Tesla   ends up taking a meaningful hit on margins.On the earnings call shortly after the software-limited 60 kWh   pack was introduced, CEO Elon Musk said that most people that   were buying the base 60 were optioning up to where average   transaction prices were ""over $80,000,"" while acknowledging lower   margins:Because people are optioning up the 60, it actually ends up     being decent. I mean it's not...maybe it is 15% to 20% gross     margin whereas say something, like if somebody orders the     performance dual motor, that might actually be more like a 30%,     35% gross margin. But there's just a small number of people     that want high-performance cars and are willing to pay triple     digits, or six digits I should say. But it also remains to be     seen how many who order the 60 then choose to do the upgrade to     75 kilowatt hour rate.There is going to be some number, it's too early to tell, of     people who buy it at 60, realize they want the extra range, and     then they can just order it kind of like an in-app purchase on     the car screen and unlock it. I suspect we will see a pretty     decent number of people do that. But we don't, it is still very     early, so it's hard to say what number that would be. And if     they do do that, then it would push gross margins up into the     20s [percent], like mid-20s [percent] or something.For reference, Tesla's adjusted automotive gross margin last   quarter was 22.2%, which was down sequentially due to delayed   Autopilot-related software updates; the company said it   recognized ""almost no new Autopilot-related revenue"" during the   quarter.Tesla's justification that the move is meant to streamline   ordering doesn't pass the sniff test. More than likely, the S 60   is being discontinued for financial reasons, if the upgrade rate   is lower than Tesla had previously anticipated. A large   concentration of non-upgraded 60s with a 15% to 20% gross margin   could put pressure on profitability, while discontinuing the   option pushes the margin on those vehicles to the 20% to 25%   range with the potential downside of losing some customers who   aren't willing to pay more.Hopefully, the margin upside offsets any lost sales.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Business Model Innovation Will Help Make Make Energy Storage Work;3/18/2017;"Energy storage is coming to closer to a reality for hundreds   of thousands of residential energy customers, and we still don't   know how companies are going to sell it to them. A battery system   could be purchased or leased, and a customer could make money off   it through a revenue-sharing program, or some kind of service   model that maximized its value to customers. If you look back to   2010, when the residential solar market was in a similar   position, it was the business model that separated the winners   from the crowd. And it was companies offering leases to customers   on a large scale who were early winners.We do know that residential energy storage is expected to be a   multibillion-dollar business by the end of the decade, we just   don't know what business model will work for energy storage   companies. And whoever can get the business model right will be   in a nice position for investors.Tesla's Powerwall on a home. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The national installer modelA number of companies are trying to leverage their residential   solar footprint to expand into energy storage.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is the largest of these after its acquisition of   SolarCity, andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) is another player worth watching.Tesla's early Powerwall models were sold directly to customers   with the main justification being backup power. But as costs come   down and rate structures with demand charges or time-of-use rates   become more common, we'll see more financial justification for   energy storage, and new business models will open up.National installers will also likely try to fold energy   storage into a long-term energy contract for consumers. Sunrun is   doing this with its Brightbox lease, which matches its focus on   solar leases. Marrying the two together could keep the lease   alive and give national installers new life.The dealer energy storage modelI should also note that national installers are losing market   share because the lease is quickly losing popularity. I think   that will lead to a service-oriented dealer model opening up.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is an example of a company who uses dealers,   providing equipment and services, but leaning on the dealer to   complete sales and perform installations.In energy storage, SunPower may provide a pre-engineered   solution that plugs directly into its solar systems as well as   financing and some sort of value-generation model. A customer may   buy the energy storage system and then share the revenue   generated with SunPower. It may lease and share value, similar to   the national installer model I outlined above. Or it may just   sell the system and provide the algorithm that controls the   system for a fee.The third-party energy storage modelOne growing model is having energy storage as a stand-alone   service, not tied to a solar system's financing. Sonnen is one of   the industry leaders in Germany, where energy storage has been   viable for years now, and is moving quickly to grow in the U.S.   as well. In total, the company has installed over 10,000 energy   storage systems around the world.Sonnen's system is designed to work with a solar system in the   U.S., but it wouldn't necessarily have to be combined with solar.   Sonnen can even aggregate excess energy from a community energy   program, effectively creating an energy sharing program.Buying solar and energy storage separately is what's normally   done in commercial solar, with companies like Stem taking the   lead on energy storage and only having an adjacent involvement   with solar. This model could potentially make sense as a business   model in the residential market as well, although it would be a   harder sell than marrying up with a solar system.What we know energy storage needsYou may notice that all of the models I outlined above have a   large company behind the scenes pulling the strings, and that's   important. A small company doesn't have the scale to build the   algorithms needed to know when charging and discharging an energy   storage system would generate the most value. And in different   states and areas under different utilities with different rate   structures, the decision-making process would be different.   Companies need scale and the ability to control thousands of   energy storage systems to aggregate the value.While big players may be power brokers behind the scenes, it's   still not clear how the model will interact with customers. The   solar market is moving toward more cash and loan sales and away   from leases from national installers, so that's worth keeping in   mind if energy storage is tied directly to solar. But the need   for a large company to generate value from energy storage may   pull large companies back into the mix, whether that's   manufacturers, or on the installation side.Whoever can get this formula right will have a huge market   ahead of them. And the energy storage market is coming quickly   and may open up a lot faster than investors think.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Go Long the Super Story In Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI recently shared winning trades inTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The most recent was along TLSA upsidetrade, and earlier I suggested investorscatch it as a falling knife. They both brought me fast profits, so I now need to reset another.makeArticleAd();Source: Tesla MotorsThe financial fundamental story in TSLA almost doesn't matter. So-called financial bad news has been a temporary source of downside pressure. Take the recent capital raise for example; its anticipation brought about worry which was reflected in price action, then once the event passed, Tesla stock rallied.The overall fundamental picture for TSLA stock is one that is bifurcated - there are haters versus life-long devotees. I fall in the middle as I am not a fan of its prospects but I strongly believe in TSLA buyers. All I need to know is that they will step in to support the stock after falls.TSLA is a dominant player in batteries, especially for the auto industry. To complement that, they also have a tie into the solar space.Although combustion engines are still the norm, e-cars have been gaining ground.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsFor the next few months, TSLA stock is a bad short idea. Bears cannot disprove the upside story in Tesla's claims. They are concepts with long-term milestones. This usually creates a negative headline vacuum, levitating the stock. Elon Musk also publicly recommitted to staying there for the long term, so that risk is low too.Click to EnlargeNot all TSLA stock fans will buy it at the same level; hence the chop in its price action. I have been successful in selling risk behind lines where most Tesla bulls would buy. Today I look to repeat performance, but for the long term. My schedule will be hectic for the next few months, so I want positions that are relatively low maintenance.TSLA Stock TradeThe Bet:Sell the TSLA Jan 2018 $145 put for $4 per contract or better. This is a bullishly biased trade. I need Tesla stock to stay above my sold put - otherwise I am committed to buying shares at $145 even if it falls much lower.For a less aggressive stance, I can modify the bet into a credit put spread instead.The Alternate:Sell the TSLA Jan 2018 $150/$145 credit put spread. This is also a bullish trade for which I collect 60 cents per contract. I have a 90% chance that TSLA stays above my sold risk to yield 11% on risk.

Tesla, Inc. Raises $1.2 Billion in Offerings;3/17/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) priced its concurrent stock and convertible note   offerings last night, and the total capital raised came in at   $1.2 billion, slightly higher than the $1.15 billion that Tesla   had previously expected even after a 15% underwriter option. That   $1.2 billion is the gross amount raised before factoring in   underwriting discounts and other costs associated with the   offering, some of which are not insignificant.The total amount raised could climb to $1.4 billion if   underwriters exercise all options. We'll find out in a few days   if they do or not.Tesla factory in Fremont. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The equityIn terms of the common stock offering, it was priced at $262   and Tesla ended up selling 1.33 million shares, compared to the   969,000 it initially planned to sell. Underwriters still have   options to purchase another 200,000 shares on top of that if   investor demand is there. The net proceeds to Tesla after the   underwriting discount are about $348 million. That puts the   dilutive impact of the stock offering at 0.8% -- rather   minimal.The stock offering is pretty straightforward, while the   convertible note offering is where things get a little bit more   interesting and complicated.The convertibles are pricing in more riskThe convertible notes due 2022 ended up pricing at a 2.375%   coupon rate, with an aggregate principal amount of $850 million,   up from the prior expectation of $750 million. The net proceeds   to Tesla will be $840 million after the underwriting discount.   The notes will have a conversion price of $327.50, which   represents a conversion premium of 25% compared to current   levels.Compare those figures to Tesla's last convertible note   offering from 2014 (underwriters exercised their options in full   on that offering).MaturityPrincipal AmountInterest RateConversion Premium2019$920 million0.25%42.5%2021$1.38 billion1.25%42.5%Data source: SEC filings.The higher interest rate and lower conversion premium   associated with the current offering show that the market is   pricing in more risk associated with these notes. It's possible   this is related to the recent acquisition of SolarCity, since the   deal weakened Tesla's balance sheet, as it assumed quite a bit of   its sister company's debt; Tesla had $2.7 billion in total   long-term debt and capital leases at the end of Q3, which jumped   to $6.8 billion at the end of Q4 after closing on SolarCity (not   including solar bonds).Additionally, Tesla is entering into hedge and warrant   transactions to offset and mitigate any potential dilution should   the notes be converted. But these transactions areexpensive. Tesla says it expects to spend $131.5 million of the note   proceeds to cover the costs of these hedges, which will only be   partially offset from proceeds from the warrant transactions.   That's a high price to pay, but the alternative is for   shareholders to face even greater potential dilution if shares   exceed the conversion price of $327.50.In other words, Tesla is spending about 15% of the net   proceeds from these notes on the related hedges, so it will only   collect about $708.5 million.Model 3 production is only four months awayIf we add up the net expected proceeds from both offerings,   after deducting the hedge expenses but before the possibility of   underwriters exercising their options, Tesla will add $1.06   billion to its coffers to help reduce risk ahead of Model 3,   which covers a good chunk of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion in   capital expenditures that are planned for the new vehicle. With   Model 3 still on track for production to begin in July, it's   crunch time.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock: Your Time Is Running Out;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was a niche player in its early days, focusing on graphic processing units (GPUs), or graphics cards. That was way back when, before several NVDA stock splits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn the early days, there were big players likeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC),Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) andTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM) that all made chip sets for GPUs. And they still do.But Nvidia madereally high-endGPUs. Gamers loved them. Research labs and universities loved them. NVDA carved out a solid business but was never given much attention since it was a niche and no matter how many geeks bought its GPUs, it wasn't going to be a major player by dominating that sector.Nvidia then did what successful, out-of-the-box companies do. It looked out years in the future and decided to set a course to a new industry - visual computing.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt bet that as computers got faster and broadband delivered more information faster, that visual computing would become a major part of computing for decades to come. And NVDA was right.Now, the market cap for NVDA stock is bigger than all but the biggest players in the market - INTC andTexas Instruments Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). Because its tech is so advanced, it also has partnered with a number of companies to add their components into devices and machines built for others. It's like car companies that feature a premium sound system or designer interior.It now looks like NVDA'snewest GPU is now on track to steal AMD's GPU's lunch. Also, its GPUs were selected to be in the newestNintendo Co., Ltd. (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY) gaming devices. And both of these come on the heels of a very bullish Q4 and full year earnings report for NVDA.Oddly enough, the stock sold off on the release, which is certainly a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" kind of thing, because there was no reason for the selloff. And even after the selloff, NVDA stock is up 212% in the past 12 months.What's more, the stock has already crossed back over the psychologically important $100-a-share mark.This recent performance indicates that traders sold the news, took some profits and are now back in for the next leg up.What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Needs to Make ANY Waves From HereI wrote about NVDA last monthafter its fall from its lofty heights around $120 per share, and now it looks like the momentum is now behind the stock again, as predicted.Don't let its price-to-earnings ratio of 41 deter you. Nvidia's growth almost makes that a reasonable valuation, and even if it's slightly expensive, it's less of a premium than you see on many stocks with a lot less growth potential.With a market leading position in the biggest trends in computing - big data, virtual reality, augmented reality, internet of things, smart cars and other devices - NVDA is in the catbird seat.

3 Reasons to Love Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Stock;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAbbott Laboratories(NYSE:ABT) is up 17% up so far this year and is beginning to look more like its old self. From early 2011 to the middle of 2015, ABT stock expanded from just $22 per share to over $50. Since that high, Abbott has been going sideways. The current run leaves Abbott at its highest point since the mid-2015 peak.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrWhile some analysts believe Abbott stock is going to cool-off because of its recent run, I believe in its prospects going forward.Abbott has an impressively diverse portfolio, solid growth on tap and an enviable dividend history.Here are three reasons why you should still pursue Abbott Laboratories as astock to buy, even with the gains it's already booked this year.ABT Has Strong Sales GrowthAbbott has a wide-ranging healthcare portfolio full of names consumers and medical experts alike are quite familiar with. Heard of Pedialyte and Pediasure? That's Abbott. Need generic pharmaceuticals for hypothyroidism or  Ménière's disease? Abbott. Need a vaccine for the flu? Abbott. That strong portfolio is one driver of growth for the company.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsWhile earnings have shrunk by 15% annually over the last half-decade, a double-digit annual expansion is expected for the five years looking forward. Sales growth is in part to thank - this year, sales are expected to expand by 25%.Abbott Is Acquisition SavvyThat sales growth is in part thanks to Abbott's recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a medical device company that further rounds out the healthcare giant's portfolio. According to the company's most recent earnings release, Abbott now holds the first or second positions across several cardiovascular device areas.Abbott also recently announced that it willnotfollow through on its acquisition of Alere. I like the fact that Abbott is willing to pivot in the face of what it sees as eroding value, and believe certainty around the acquisition (okay, well, the lack thereof) is good for investor morale.ABT Stock DividendIn addition to offering organic growth, Abbott also rewards loyal investors with a dividend. The company has paid a dividend for 373 straight quarters - a streak that dates back almost a century! On top of that, it's increased the payout for 45 straight years.As the company noted on its website, that makes Abbott a member of theS&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for 25 consecutive years.A Tesla Inc (TSLA) Cash Raise Gets ... A Hero's Welcome?That gives ABT stock a yield north of 2.3% even in the wake of its recent run. You can bet that yield will grow with more increases.Abbott stock's run so far this year is a solid base for further gains. While the 2015 peak may serve as resistance down the line, I think it will be easy climb until that point.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Better Buy: Tesla vs. BMW;3/17/2017;"In the high-end performance segment of the auto industry,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) andBMW(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) are two of the best brands and most innovative   manufacturers in the world. BMW has long been an aspirational   brand focused on high performance with a level of luxury that   consumers demand when spending upward of $100,000 on a vehicle.   Tesla is breaking all of the rules of the auto industry and is   growing its fleet of electric vehicles.But investors have to balance growth with performance and   value in a stock. And with BMW and Tesla, those factors collide   amid a passionate debate about the future of the auto   industry.The electric BMW i3. Image source: BMW.makeArticleAd();The known commodityBMW is the better-known company of these two, having sold 2.37   million vehicles in 2016 and generated 6.9 billion euros in net   income for the year. Its EBIT (earnings before interest and   taxes) margin of 8.9% is among the industry's best, and   management has guided for 8% to 10% EBIT margin through 2020.What BMW brings from a manufacturing and quality standpoint is   extremely valuable, even though those are less tangible factors   than financial results. The company has decades of   manufacturing expertise and has been able to generate strong   margins while staying at the forefront of new technologies like   carbon fiber, autonomous driving, and electric vehicles (EVs).   It's even launched a ride-sharing product in Seattle, with   Portland (Oregon) and Brooklyn expected to follow.The advantage investors have with BMW is knowing that it can   execute on its automotive manufacturing plans and having   confidence in its ability to follow industry trends where they're   headed. With EVs clearly growing as a percentage of auto sales   around the world, BMW can learn and adapt to where the market is   going. But it'll be able to follow upstarts like Tesla as they   grow the market rather than being on the bleeding edge of a new   industry.Tesla's Model S with the first Powerwall. Image source:     Tesla.The upstart with a lot of unknowns aheadTesla has gotten the most attention of any EV company, and for   good reason. It's pushing the envelope, and its EV-only business   model seems to be the most effective way to build a viable EV   brand. And with energy storage and solar power under its wing,   the company has broad and diverse exposure to renewable   energy.All of that growth comes at a cost, though, with Tesla   spending $1.28 billion on capital expenditures in 2016. Goldman   Sachs recently predicted that 2017 capital expenditures would be   $3 billion to build out capacity to build the Model 3 and ramp up   to capacity for 500,000 vehicles in 2018. Plus, the company needs   to fund raw materials for building out the Model 3.The allure of growth is intoxicating, but it comes at high   risk as well. Analysts already expect Tesla will need to   raise capital in coming months to fund its growth plans. And the   company certainly needs to improve quality and its parts supply   chain just to match competitors (for evidence of this, read   fellow Fool Evan Niu's saga abouttrying to get his Model S repaired). Improving manufacturing quality and building out an   international parts supply chain is no small task, and it's   something Tesla has never done, so it's an unknown for the   company and leaves a lot of uncertainty for investors.Tesla's products are well liked by early adopters, but   still haven't been tested by the masses. While BMW sold over 2   million vehicles last year, Tesla has only sold about one-tenth   that figure in its nearly 14-year history. Translating hype to   operational success could prove harder than Tesla can handle.Why it's hard to pay up for potential in the auto   industryGiven the unknowns facing Tesla, it's hard to justify paying   10 times the price-to-sales ratio investors are getting with BMW.   And keep in mind that Tesla would have had to increase deliveries   by 31 times just to match BMW in 2016.BAMXF Market Capdata byYCharts.Maybe the more fundamental question is whether or not the auto   industry, and big players like BMW, will be able to adapt to   Tesla if the latter's success continues. And I'll point out that   progress in the auto industry is extremely slow. Tesla seems like   an upstart, but it's nearly 14 years old and is still making   fewer than 100,000 vehicles per year. That's not much of a track   record, no matter how good the company's brand is, and I think   automakers will quickly be able to catch Tesla in the EV   market.The fact that investors have to pay a massive premium to own   Tesla's shares is the main reason I think BMW is the better stock   to own today. There's more stability, a longer track record, and   we know BMW can be a world-class manufacturer -- something Tesla   still hasn't proven to investors.10 stocks we like better than BMWWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Are Chipmakers So Interested in Autonomous Cars?;3/16/2017;"It's the same reason that automakers are interested in the market. Although for them, it's also a question of preventing tech companies from encroaching on their turf. There doesn't seem to be any likelihood of such encroachment however, at least in the near future, as there is too much to making a car that's just too far from what tech companies do best. So the first fully-autonomous cars that make it to the market will most likely be a collaborative effort between auto makers and tech companies.The primary selling point for self-driving cars is increased safety due to fewer accidents. There has been some research suggesting that when computers take over the roads, they will remove the chances of accidents due to human error (for sleep, distraction, intoxication, carelessness, brake failure or other mechanical problems, or when it's the other guy's fault, or any other reason). And of course this is what is broadly propounded by the companies invested in the phenomenon. Kathy Winter, the VP and general manager of the automated driving division at IntelINTCthinks that it will also help create logistics solutions for transportation and delivery of products.But don't expect a sudden jump from driven to driverless cars. It's more likely that cars will increasingly incorporate features that automate certain functions over time, making them semi-automated to varying degrees. Regulatory and insurance considerations will also likely require the presence of a driver long after cars become fully-automated.The Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California, recently conducted a survey of forty experts including policymakers, researchers, government representatives, nonprofit organizations and tech companies, presenting the results in a report titled ""3 Revolutions: Sharing, Electrification, and Automation."" The chief findings were as follows:70% of survey participants think fully driverless vehicles   will account for more than 20% of vehicles sold by 2040.88% think commercially offered shared rides will make up more   than 5% of all U.S. passenger miles by 2030, and 78% think   commercially offered shared rides will account for more than 20%   of U.S. passenger miles traveled by 2040.70% also think that by 2050, the majority of vehicles used   commercially for ride and car sharing in the nation will be zero   emissions vehicles, including battery, plug-in hybrid, and   fuel-cell electric vehicles.According to IHS Automotive forecasts, several thousand autonomous vehicles will be on U.S. roads in 2020, with the number growing to nearly 4.5 million vehicles by 2035. By then, there will be 21 million autonomous vehicles on the road globally, growing at a 43% CAGR from 2025 to 2035.No wonder everyone is excited.What's In It For Chipmakers?Both Intel and NVIDIANVDAsay that the fully automated car will have as much electronic horsepower as a super computer.Whether a lidar or radar system is used to pick up images of the area surrounding the car, the system is based on semiconductors. These images have to be processed and matched with relevant data to decide a course of action at the blink of an eye. So there's processing (analog, logic), communications and machine learning involved. Each of these operations will be facilitated with semiconductors. Plus there's entertainment, displays and syncing with other devices that will also require semiconductors.Key PlayersThe Intel Go computer and NVIDIA Drive PX 2 are designed to help cars detect pedestrians, objects, lanes, respond to traffic signals, etc. BMW is testing the Intel solution while TeslaTSLAis testing the NVIDIA solution. BaiduBIDUis developing an artificial intelligence platform that combines its cloud platform with NVIDIA self-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, etc for the Chinese market.NVIDIA has a lead in the machine learning segment and its automotive chips are already in millions of cars from a number of suppliers, which in combination, gives it an edge in the automated car segment.Intel has been in collaboration with Mobileye for quite a while and has finally announced that it will buy the Israeli supplier of self-driving technology (camera and laser-based sensors) for $15 billion. Mobileye currently sells its technology to 27 automakers across the world, so the combination will be highly advantageous for Intel.QualcommQCOM, which beat Intel hands down in the mobile computing business, is also set to rule in self-driving cars (although this time, competition will be tough with both Intel and NVIDIA having gained some mileage). The company recently launched its Drive Data Platform, which is its version of a self-driving system to process the sensor inputs generated by a vehicle. The system is based on the Snapdragon 820Am and makes use of the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE).But there's more. Qualcomm's soon-to-be-completed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in an all-cash deal worth $47 billion brings on board NXP's RF SoC for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. While IVI may not sound that exciting in the context of self-driving cars, the thing to bear in mind in this case is the SoC technology that will shrink the size of high power systems while lowering the cost.This will be quite a breakthrough for Qualcomm as a lower price will speed up adoption of its systems. Additionally, NXP is the biggest supplier of automotive chips worldwide so it has the necessary relationships to jumpstart its business.AlphabetGOOGLhas developed self-driving technology of its own but its component suppliers aren't known. Back in 2015, the company quietly acquired Lumedyne, a maker of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors including an optical accelerometer, a vibration energy harvester and a ""Time Domain Switched"" type of inertial sensor for $85 million. Lumedyne also had a number of patents pending approval at the time.Over the years, Google has also been hiring a growing number of people with chip design skills. In 2015 itself, Google's Pixel team advertised an opening for a ""multimedia chip architect"" who can ""lead a chip development effort"" and ""work with other engineers to take chip to product shipment"". Google was particularly looking for expertise in ""image processing, video processing, stabilization."" The Pixel still uses NVIDIA chips, but Google does have internally developed self-driving technology and the greatest number of self-driving miles on record to train its self-driving system.Wrapping UpThe self-driving/autonomous car conversation is just getting started. There will no doubt be much innovation in the space over the next few years, both by the biggest tech players and automakers and by smaller startups. In fact, CB Insights estimates that financing in the auto tech startup sector was over $1 billion in 2016 and more money will surely follow. This is one of the best places to be in because the technology is just being built, so it could be good business. Also, early investors can sell out their interest at a nice premium.For chipmakers it's a rush to grab a share of the pie.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Why the Market Likes Tesla's Capital Raise;3/16/2017;"While most companies tend to see shares fall after announcing   secondary offerings, it's not uncommon forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) shares to rise after announcing fresh capital   raises. This was true for both Tesla's2015 secondary offeringand to lesser extent the 2016 offering. It's also happening today   after the electric-car maker announced last night that it is   having concurrent offerings for both common stock and convertible   notes. Shares are up about 3% as of this writing.This time around, there's probably a more specific reason why   the market is reacting favorably to the offerings: The dilution   hit that existing shareholders are taking ismuchsmaller due to the mix.The proceeds will be used to reduce Model 3 launch risk.     Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The equity sideFor context, consider the past two secondary offerings, which   consisted entirely of stock. Last year's offering, which raised   $1.7 billion, was particularly dilutive.YearShares Outstanding BeforeShares Outstanding AfterDilution2016133.9 million147.3 million10%2015127.1 million130.2 million2%Data source: Offering prospectuses.The $250 million stock offering announced last night is fairly   conservative in terms of dilution. Shareholders took a pretty   large dilution hit last year with the all-stock acquisition of   SolarCity, as there are now 161.6 million shares outstanding.   Tesla is selling between roughly 969,000 and 1.1 million shares,   representing dilution of just 0.6% to 0.7%, depending on if   underwriters exercise their options in full. Underwriters   exercised their options in full for the past two offerings, so it   seems conceivable they will do so again, depending on investor   demand.The debt sideThe bulk of the capital being raised will be coming from $750   million in convertible senior notes due 2022. Here's how the   company closed out 2016 in terms of outstanding principal amounts   for any remaining convertibles.DuePrincipal Amount2018 notes$205 million2019 notes$920 million2021 notes$1.4 billionTotal$2.5 billionData source: 10-K.This does not include the $909 million worth of convertible   notes that Tesla inherited from SolarCity, which bear higher   interest rates (other than a zero-coupon tranche).This comes after Tesla received notices of $422 million worth   of conversions for its 2018 convertibles last summer, which the   company had to repay in cash at the time. In a way, you can think   of it like Tesla is in part refinancing the convertibles that   were redeemed last summer, except the new notes will likely end   up having higher conversion prices.The new batch of convertibles has not priced quite yet, but   Tesla does intend to enter into convertible note hedge   transactions and warrant transactions as a way to mitigate any   possible dilution. The company has done this every time it has   issued convertibles in the past (not including the inherited   SolarCity convertibles).On top of all this, debt capital is generally less expensive   than equity capital, so the cost of capital associated with these   offerings is lower than if it consisted of all stock. Combined   with the minimal dilution that shareholders are facing and the   reduced balance-sheet risk, the market seems to like it.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders Might Have a Painful Wait;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has taken a bit of a breather this month after a terrific run. Apple stock gained 30% just between November and early March, and is up over 50% from late June levels.makeArticleAd();The latter run, incredibly, has added about $250 billion to the market value of AAPL stock.Part of the gains have come from the fact that AAPL was just too cheap, particularly below $100 this summer. But optimism toward the iPhone 8 has boosted hopes that Apple stock can jump-start growth. (The issues at key competitorSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), including theGalaxy Note 7 debacle, likely have helped as well.)So the question now for AAPL is when the iPhone 8 is coming - and how much upside might be left from a successful launch and product cycle.For now, it looks like there's still some gains left for Apple stock … but investors might need to have some patience.Will the iPhone 8 Move Apple Stock?At the moment, it appears the iPhone 8 will be launched this fall, according to various reports. But Apple has said little about the launch, leaving a guessing game for observers and investors. Even the name isn't clear: The next phone seems likely to be called the iPhone 8, not the 7S, but that's not assured at the moment.Most observers are expecting an iPhone 8, rather than a 7S, because the next-gen product will have major changes. The most notable was thought to be a curved OLED screen, but those reports have been questioned of late. Iris recognition, facial scanning, and a larger screen (on a phone of similar dimensions) are all expected to be features of various versions of the phone.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsWhat might be most interesting for Apple stock is the price. On Monday morning, Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said supplier prices supported a possible $1,000 price for the new iPhone. Other reports of a high-end""Edition""have speculated an ASP over $1,200. Higher prices for iPhones mean higher margins for Apple - and likely a higher multiple for AAPL stock.Will Investors Buy the Leaks and Sell the News?The biggest worry ahead of the launch is if there will be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" reaction from investors.It is clear that some of the optimism over the past few months, in particular, has been driven by consumer reaction to the leaked specs for the new iPhone. Indeed, Apple stock traditionally has been movedalmost solely by iPhone sentiment. Sales of other products have been pretty much flat the last four years.So if there is a large base of investors bidding up the Apple stock price ahead of the iPhone 8, the question then becomes: What might happen in September when the product actually is released?The higher expectations get now, the greater the chance of a disappointment later. Every aspect of the new product will be dissected - and any rumored specs (like, say, the $1,000 price tag) that aren't in the iPhone 8 will be considered a ""miss"" by Apple.What's Left for the iPhone 8?With Apple stock back near an all-time high, that possibility would concern me over the next few months. For investors with a longer-term focus, however, there's still reason to see upside in AAPL off the iPhone 8 launch.Again, AAPL stock generally has matched up well with iPhone product cycles, and that should keep the stock moving upward if the launch and subsequent sales are a success.The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Small SUV Has Big ImplicationsMeanwhile, a big hit with the new iPhone could once again separate Apple from Samsung. It would also differentiate iOs fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android ecosystem more broadly. That in turn might allow AAPL stock to once again receive a growth multiple, instead of the low-double-digit-plus cash earnings multiple at which it currently trades.In either direction, the iPhone 8 will matter, because the iPhone still is the major profit engine for Apple. Roughly 63% of fiscal 2016 sales came from the iPhone - and given margins, possibly a higher portion of profits. Apple needs a winner in the iPhone 8 to drive Apple stock higher. And while early speculation looks like the iPhone 8 will be a hit, the recent run in AAPL stock may have priced in at least some of that success.Investors hoping for more likely will need to wait for September - and hope Apple has once again delivered on its promise.The author has no position in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlaceHow GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Could Make a ComebackDoes the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacle Signal Doom for These Unicorns?Interest Rates are Rising -- Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why is Tesla Raising a Billion Dollars in Fresh Capital?;3/16/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAannounced plans to raise around $1.1 billion through a combination of share and senior notes offering, just before initiating the pre-production of its Model 3 sedan. The company will utilize the funds to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce risks associated with the rapid expansion of business. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.makeArticleAd();The electric automaker will be offering shares worth roughly $250 million and convertible senior notes valued $750 million. The notes are due to mature in 2022. Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, intends to purchase 96,900 shares worth $25 million himself.Tesla unveiled the Model 3 sedan in Mar 2016. The vehicle will be the company's first affordable electric car for the mass market, costing almost half as much as Model S. Notably, Model 3 is a four-door, five-seat electric sedan with a range of 215 miles per charge and acceleration of 0-60 mph in less than 6 seconds. Vehicle production and deliveries are expected in the second half of 2017. The company aims to steadily increase production to exceed 5,000 units per week in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10,000 vehicles per week in 2018.Prior to this offering, Tesla had raised $1.7 billion via a public offering of shares in May 2016. The capital was used to finance the accelerated production plan for Model 3 as well as to ramp up annual production volume to 500,000 units by 2018 and 1 million units by 2020.Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $3.39 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. However, the cash balance mostly represents cash generated from its May offering, the SolarCity acquisition and drawings on its credit facilities. Meanwhile, the company saw cash outflow in 2016. The company projected capital expenditures of around $2-$2.5 billion for the first half of 2017, implying limited cash balance before the Model 3 production scheduled for the second half of the year. The company's need for capital had been anticipated last year and increased significantly post the guidance.Tesla Inc. PriceTesla Inc. Price|Tesla Inc.

Tesla, Inc. Makes Up Its Mind: Time to Raise Capital;3/16/2017;"There had been quite a bit of uncertainty in recent quarters   over whether or notTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) was going to raise more capital ahead of the Model   3 launch. The company raised $1.7 billion in its May 2016   secondary offering after underwritersexercised all of their options. That put Tesla in a relatively more comfortable financial   position at the time.The following month, it announced its ambitious and   controversial proposal to acquire sister company SolarCity in an   all-stock deal, which many expected to be cash flow negative.   This raised the notion that Tesla may need to raise capital yet   again. Tesla was able to mostly address this concern by   aggressivelyshifting away from solar leases and toward   sales, which pulls forward both revenue recognition and cash flow;   Tesla's solar operations generated $77 million of positive cash   flow last quarter.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Still, it wasn't clear until yesterday what the company was   planning to do. Then Tesla announced concurrent stock and   convertible note offerings, expecting to raise $1.15 billion.Mixed messagesIn theS-4related to the SolarCity acquisition, filed in August, Tesla said   that it was planning to raise more capital (emphasis added):While Tesla expects that its current sources of liquidity,     including cash and cash equivalents, together with its current     projections of cash flow from operating and retail financing     activities, will provide it with adequate liquidity based on     its current plans through at least the end of the current     fiscal year,Tesla is currently planning to raise additional funds     by the end of this year, including through potential equity or debt offerings, subject     to market conditions and recognizing that Tesla cannot be     certain that additional funds would be available to it on     favorable terms or at all.In October, CEO Elon Musk backtracked on that expectation with   aseries of tweets.Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity   will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary   for either.- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)October 9, 2016@roger_kapplerProbably not then either- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)October 9, 2016On the third-quarter earnings call later that month, Musk   said, ""It seems like we probably won't want to do a capital raise   even in Q1. I'm not saying we won't, but probably not."" Musk   hedged quite a bit, advising to ""take this with a grain of salt""   and noting ""that's not a promise"" -- the statements just   represented Tesla's view at the time. He added that it might make   sense to ""have a larger buffer and to de-risk the business.""On the fourth-quarter earnings call just last month, Musk had   clearly warmed up to the idea:So this is really a question of what is the risk tolerance     of the company. Or how close to the edge do we want to go?     According to our financial plan, no capital needs to be raised     for the Model 3. But we get very close to the edge. So then     that is probably not the best thing for shareholders on a     risk-adjusted basis. So we are considering a number of options,     but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce     risk.In other words, Tesla is saying it doesn't necessarilyneedthe capital, but it would be helpful just in case.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are in rally mode this morning, as Wall Street continues to cheer what some are calling a ""dovish"" interest rate hike from Federal Reserve. The Fed raised its key fed funds rate to a range of 0.75% to 1%, as expected, but said that it would hike rates only twice more this year, versus expectations for a much more hawkish tone.makeArticleAd();On the economic data calendar, weekly jobless claims are due out ahead of the open, while reports on housing starts, building permits and the Philly Fed index are due later this morning.Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.3%, withS&P 500futures gaining 0.19% andNasdaq-100futures jumping 0.21%.On the options front, volume rebounded back above average on Wednesday as options traders engaged in a bit of positioning ahead of the Fed rate hike. Overall, roughly 17.7 million calls and 13.5 million puts crossed the tape. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio plunged to 0.61 from Tuesday's perch at 0.73, though the 10-day moving average edged higher to 0.64.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) saw increased call volume after RBC Capital boosted its price target on AAPL stock.Oracle Corporation(NASDAQ:ORCL) posted better-than-expected earnings and bumped its dividend, andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it was raising $1.15 billion via stock and debt offerings to fund its Model 3 rollout.Apple Inc. (AAPL)More bullish news on AAPL stock hit yesterday, afterRBC Capital reiterated the sharesat ""outperform"" and lifted its price target to $155 from $140. RBC told clients that it believes Apple's services unit could provide a considerable tailwind for annual revenue. The news helped bump AAPL stock north of resistance at $140, and could bring in technical buyers over the short-term.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashAAPL stock options traders were jazzed about the development. Total volume spiked to more than 921,000 contracts, with calls snapping up an above average 64% of the day's take. Looking out to the April series, we find that AAPL stock is now trading north of both peak call and put open interest at the $140 strike, totaling 84,500 contracts and 50,000 contracts, respectively.If stock can pull away from $140 over the next week, it could be major boon for AAPL bulls. Otherwise, look for Apple shares to get pinned near $140.Oracle Corporation (ORCL)ORCL stock is in rally mode this morning, gaining more than 6.6% in premarket activity. Traders are reacting bullishly tobetter-than-expected earningsafter the close last night, where Oracle said it earned 69 cents per share on revenue of $9.3 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 62 cents a share on sales of $9.3 billion. Cloud sales came in at $1.2 billion. Oracle also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 19 cents per share, a 27% increase its prior dividend of 15 cents per share.ORCL stock options traders were uncertain ahead of the event. Total volume came in at over 324,000 contracts, with calls only managing 53% of the day's take. If ORCL's gains carry over into the open, the shares would vault well north of peak April call OI, totaling 10,000 contracts at the $44 strike.What's more, the 9,300 calls open at the $45 strike could also fall by the wayside, leaving little in the way of potential options related resistance to hold ORCL stock in check.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla was back in the headlines for a second day in a row. On Tuesday, rumors hit thatTesla was building a small SUVdubbed the Model Y, and today TSLA stock is gaining premarket after the company announced it wasraising $1.15 billionto fund its Model 3 rollout.

The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Small SUV Has Big Implications;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly revving up production of its Model Y crossover, which is slated to come out in 2018. And investors, who were pressing for some good news, wasted no time Tuesday calling shotgun on TSLA stock.makeArticleAd();Shares of the California-based electric vehicle company rose almost $12 Tuesday, rising almost 5% after a report from British automotive magazineAutocarclaimed Tesla is set to unveil a ""Small SUV coming next year."" Production of theModel Y, which is likely to have the same top-hinged doors as the full-size Model X, could start as soon as this year, but would debut no sooner than 2018.Model Y Hype … or Hope?The Model Y would be a critical launch for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who aims to compete withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral MotorsCompany(NYSE:GM) in vehicle mass-market production. And it would certainly give a boost to TSLA stock.To that end, while it's only speculation at this point, it makes sense that the Model Y is rumored to be based on the same platform as the Model 3 - Tesla's new and most-affordable model.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonReports suggest the Model Y is ""expected to be slightly more expensive"" than the Model 3, which is said to be priced around $35,000. But if ""more expensive"" still keeps the Model Y at under $45,000, it's still a win - and a breakthrough for Tesla given the popularity of crossovers throughout the United States.While Musk's critics, who have been skeptical of the company's financial position and its rate of cash burn, will claim that Tesla can't net a profit at those prices, the question is: Can Tesla make up the difference on volume?That question can be answered with Tesla's Gigafactory, which provides tons of reasons for optimism about TSLA stock.Once completed, the Gigafactory, which is projected to have capacity to manufacture lithium-ion batteries for 500,000 vehicles annually, will accelerate the pace at which Tesla can become profitable. This is because the Gigafactory can boost margins on unit sales of the Model S and Model X.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Report Changed the GameMusk has promised that the Gigafactory, which is a third completed, would be finished by 2018 - in time to start production on the Model Y. And the Gigafactory would still have tons of room to produce ""a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck"" as Musk hinted upon in his updated""Master Plan""published on Tesla's own website this past summer.Bottom Line for TSLA StockMakingan investment casefor Teslais not that hard. One only need to take a look into the future and realize Elon Musk is already there waiting not only with autonomous vehicles and connected cars, but also with cleaner/renewable energy, space travel and the Hyperloop.With TSLA stock closing Wednesday at $255 - down 10% from its 52-week high of $287.39 reached on Feb. 14 - but heading higher in Thursday's premarket trade, there's a little room for investors who have waited for a buying opportunity, but not much.

Goldman Sachs Redeems Itself Somewhat With Tesla Objectivity;3/16/2017;"It looked really bad.Last year,Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS)upgradedshares ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) to a buy rating, merehoursbefore the electric-car maker announced its 2016 secondary   offering in May. Goldman was one of the lead book runners in the   deal, and exercised all of its underwriter options tomax out the secondary offering.The timing looked awfully suspicious on Goldman's part.   Goldman's upgrade pushed shares higher, benefiting the offering's   pricing and translating into Goldman collecting more; the   underwriting discount was $1.78 per share and all underwriters in   that deal collectively earned about $19 million thanks to the   full exercise of underwriter options, according to the   prospectus.makeArticleAd();At the time, Goldman toldMarketWatch, ""Our research is independent. We followed all of our standard   policies and procedures with respect to our research publication   on Wednesday."" The timing of the two announcements was ultimately   probably a coincidence, but the optics could not have been   worse.Tesla announced last night that would be doing a common stock   offering ($250 million) as well a convertible note offering ($750   million). Guess who's among the lead book runners.Image source: Tesla.Spoiler alertAmong a few other big banks, Goldman will be acting as lead   joint book-running manager for the offering. This time around,   the news comes after Goldman issued a downgrade on Tesla shares   inlate February, from hold to sell. The main concerns driving Goldman's rating   change were risks associated with the Model 3 launch, the recent   acquisition of SolarCity, and ongoing free cash flow burn.It's worth noting that we're talking about two different   analysts. Goldman analyst Patrick Archambault, who issued the May   2016 buy rating, left the investment bank last year and passed   the metaphorical baton to analyst David Tamberrino, who   downgraded shares to neutral in October. Tamberrino then took an   even more bearish stance with the downgrade just last month.Chinese wall intact?Goldman issuing a downgrade a few weeks ahead of the offerings   does look a bit better in terms of its objectivity. Investment   banks are required to maintain a ""Chinese wall"" between their   research divisions and investment banking divisions in order to   mitigate any conflicts of interest.How intact these Chinese walls really are remains an open   debate, but at least in this case Goldman can more justifiably   argue that its research is indeed independent. Incidentally,   shares are higher now than they were after the downgrade was   issued.Reducing balance sheet riskAs far as Tesla is concerned, it's taking a slightly more   conservative approach with this offering. It's smaller, with the   aggregate gross proceeds expected at $1.15 billion. The proceeds   will be used to invest in capital expenditures ahead of Model 3   production, which Tesla recently guided to $2 billion to $2.5   billion.On the last earnings call, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that a   capital raise may make sense in order to reduce balance sheet   risk. However, Tesla gave mixed messages in late 2016 regarding   the prospect of a capital raise, so it wasn't clear if Tesla was   actually going to pull the trigger this time. It did.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Halliburton Company (HAL) Stock Is Rally-Ready!;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors witnessed a broad-based rally on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates and signaling further hikes to come later this year. However, the rally wasn't just confined to regular ol' U.S. blue chips - it also spilled over into bonds, commodities, high yield and emerging markets. What particularly caught my attention was the rally in crude oil, which resulted in oil-related stocks such asHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) bouncing meaningfully off of critical technical support.makeArticleAd();Traders and investors now have very well-defined risk to play HAL stock to the upside.Before digging into the charts of Halliburton shares, allow me to remind you that a plethora of arguments can be made about the validity and sustainability of any stock market rally. However, as active investors we must primarily be realists in the sense that until a trend changes or at least gives off strong signals that it may soon do so, it is by definition to early to start leaning the other way in any meaningful way.Wednesday's broad market rally was just another reminder of this. Stocks - which some bears have been calling ""overvalued"" for weeks and months - simply continued to rip  higher. It is neither our job to fight market trends nor to prove that we are smarter than the average investor.Our only task as market participants is to make money. Period.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashWednesday's rally in the price of oil, which bounced off its 200-day simple moving average, lifted the entire oil services industry stocks, as represented by TheMarket Vectors Oil Services ETF(NYSEARCA:OIH). As a result, many of the charts in the space - including HAL stock - look very similar in their bullish trading setups.HAL Stock ChartsStarting off with the multiyear weekly chart, we see that after breaking past the black horizontal line last November, Halliburton stock continued to rally right to the upper end of the up-trending channel.Click to EnlargeThe retracement since those January 2017 highs pulled the stock back to a key technical confluence zone made up of the following:The black horizontal line (former resistance, now support?)The lower end of the up-trending channel (purple-dotted parallel lines)The 50- and 200-week simple moving averages (yellow and red lines, respectively).This is one serious area of confluence support around the $47.50 - $48.50 area.A bounce from here if not an outright new leg higher stands a good chance. More importantly so, this support area will act as a last resort stop-loss area for long side positions being initiated here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Rumors Changed the GameOn the daily chart, we see that on Tuesday, March 14, HAL stock bounced off its 200-day moving average (red) as downside momentum - as represented by the MACD oscillator - reached oversold extremes.Click to EnlargeWednesday's post-Fed rally served as what I refer to as ""follow-through buying."" and thus it was no great surprise that my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator flashed a clear buy signal.Barring any nasty bearish reversals in coming days, HAL stock now looks poised to rally into the mid-$50s as a next upside target.Like what you see?

The day is known for a lot of things, but many use it as an excuse to drink a lot, which isn't far off from the reality of it.However, the day truly revolves around the celebration of St. Patrick, who was a missionary and bishop in Ireland in the fifth century. He was made a slave by Irish pirates, who took him to Ireland and made him into a slave before he escaped.Later in life, he returned to Ireland as a bishop and eventually became known as the patron saint of the land.

Investing in EV Infrastructure: Where the Money Is Going;3/15/2017;"Last year, 159,139 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S.,   according toInside EVs, but that's just scratching the surface of the industry's   potential.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) plans to build 500,000 EVs in 2018 andGeneralMotors(NYSE: GM) just launched its first big bet on EVs in the Chevy   Bolt, which will test the size of the market. With new cars fromNissan, Porsche,VW, Volvo, and many others, there looks to be an EV boom on the   horizon. But the size of that boom is currently unknown.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (which typically   underestimates new technologies) predicts that annual EV and   plug-in EV sales will be 1.3 million by 2025 and that 7.5 million   EVs will be on the road by then. Meanwhile, GTM Research   estimates that a total of 11.4 million EVs will be on the road in   the U.S. by 2025 and Bloomberg New Energy Finance thinks 35%   of all new vehicles sold in 2040 will be electric.We know that the EV market will be big and that, given the   scale of the numbers above and the speed of growth, EV charging   infrastructure will become increasingly important across the   country. That presents an opportunity for the companies building   out these charging capabilities.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The chargers themselves could be big businessAs EVs become more common, someone has to provide millions of   chargers for personal and public use.Aerovironment(NASDAQ: AVAV) has taken a leading position in the charger market   with partnerships with Volvo, Nissan,Ford, and others. The company has also releasedcharging plansand session prices for Level 2 (12-26 miles of charge per hour)   and fast charging (40 miles of charge in 10 minutes) on the West   Coast, where it is building out a network. In its most   recent quarter, electric charging product sales jumped 74% to   $11.3 million, a small but growing base for a small company to   build on.General Electric(NYSE: GE) is also moving into the market, selling home chargers   and public charging options. As it's a major electricity   component supplier, this is an adjacent market it can enter with   little risk, and I would expect to see GE's charger revenue   grow as the market grows.Of course, there's Tesla's charging infrastructure as well.   Tesla sells most of its own charging components to customers, and   as it's the biggest EV company, it's a big business. But the   proprietary charging technology it has bet on may end up   eventually walling it off from competitors.How chargers get builtWhat's less known is who will build the charger infrastructure   and how it will be paid for. Tesla's Supercharger network has   been built out entirely by Tesla for the use of its own   customers. It's been free for years, but now new Model S and   Model X customers will get 400 kWh of supercharging free and then   pay a fee for charging based on local electricity costs.   Competing auto manufacturers haven't shown much interest in   building out their own networks and will most likely let someone   else build chargers.Image source: Getty Images.Utilities have shown some interest in chargers being a growth   opportunity. In California,San Diego Gas & Electricis building 3,500 utility-owned chargers for $45 million,Southern California Edisonis building 1,500 host-owned chargers for $22 million, andPacific Gas & Electricis building the infrastructure behind 7,500 chargers in a   utility-private investor partnership. The question here is   whether or not utilities should be able to build chargers under   their monopoly power and therefore rate-base the cost to all   consumers, whether they own an electric vehicle or not. In   theory, a utility's low cost of capital could help build out   charger networks more quickly, although keeping utilities out of   the market may bring in more innovative business models from   private companies.The third option is third-party charging networks.NRG Energy(NYSE: NRG)  tried to get into this business but sold off   EVgo earlier this year to an investment firm that may be able to   grow the network more effectively. The national network now   countsBMW, Ford, and Nissan as partners, and its early mover status may be   helpful long term. ChargePoint is the nation's largest charging   network, aggregating local EV charging stations into a national   network. Blink is another company building a large network, which   is currently about 4,000 stations.EV charging will be big but still faces risksWhat's unique here is that there are three distinct business   models colliding in EV charging, and we don't know which one will   win long term. My money would be on third-party networks   eventually becoming victorious because of their national scope   and ability to provide different charging technologies. And if   they do, these (mostly private) networks and the companies that   build the chargers will be the big winners for investors.What we do know is that with millions of EVs expected to hit   the road in the next decade, this is a big opportunity for   companies that can get their business model right.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock: Create Income From Value;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few weeks ago, I shared a trade idea inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) from which I was lucky enough to scalp profits. Although I believe in the longer-term story, we could see temporary resistance in MSFT stock - at least in the short-term.makeArticleAd();I'm still steadfast in the thesis that, given the current macroeconomic environment, stocks will at worst meander for months. Thus, I have a trade setup that will let time make us money.Click to EnlargeMicrosoft's fundamental prospects remain solid. So, in the absence of a new bearish headline, MSFT stock should trade right along with the general equity markets. The short-term macroeconomic picture is riddled with nagging issues that could cause dips, but bulls have been buying them back up.Because of Microsoft's solid fundamentals, I want to put more time on the clock so I don't have to worry about short-term price gyrations.6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomThis is not the kind of trade idea you can use in unproven stocks likeSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), by the way.How to Trade MSFT Stock HereThe bet:Sell the Jan 2018 $50 put for $1.50 per contract. This is a bullish trade that assumes Microsoft stock will stay above my sold strike through next January.By selling the put, I have committed to buying the shares at $50 if MSFT stock falls below that threshold. The current price buffer gives this trade - in which I'm betting that support levels established in 2014 will hold - a 90% theoretical chance of success.Selling naked puts is not suited for all investors, however. That's OK. I can modify the trade into a credit spread. This would make it more appealing to less aggressive traders or smaller accounts.Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock as It Steals Snap Inc's (SNAP) ThunderThe alternate:Sell the Jan 2018 $52.50/$50 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade, but one that has a finite risk profile. For that, I sacrifice some buffer and potential profits since with limited risk comes limited profit potential. If successful, though, this trade on MSFT stock will still yield 15% on risk.Selling options can be dangerous, so never risk more than you are willing to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Go Long Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock While Everyone’s Wrong;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU) stock enjoyed a 150% rally in the past 12 months. But that's only about halfway back from the 2014 all time highs. Nevertheless, MU stock still has room to go from a technical perspective.makeArticleAd();Micron fundamentals are in good shape as we are now more dependent on technology than ever. The trend suggests that the ramp will get even steeper so we are not slowing down. Micron will benefit from the digitization of the globe.Technically speaking, MU stock is at a long-term pivot level where resistance can build. So jumping all in at this point without a safety net can be risky, especially when equity markets are at all-time highs.Click to EnlargeMore often than not, it's difficult to find great entry points in stocks that are on fire. Today, though, we're getting a dip, which helps. Plus, using MU options gives us a lot more flexibility. There, we can find value areas that I believe are safe, and we can sell risk against them.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017Furthermore, the current open interest suggests potential downside pressure.How to Trade MU Stock HereThe trade:Sell the MU Oct $18 put naked and collect 80 cents per contract. By doing this, we are committing to owning Micron stock at $18 per share if the price falls below it. Our breakeven price in this case would be $17.20. Since we are using longer-dated contracts, I am confident that we can manage risk around the short-term price gyrations. I don't want to hedge my bet.That said, selling naked risk isn't for everyone, so to moderate the trade, we can turn it into a credit put spread instead.The milder alternate:Sell the MU Oct $19/$17 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade which will potentially yield 20% on risk.Both trades have a roughly 85% theoretical chance of success. The spread advantage is that it carries finite risk, but at the cost of lower absolute reward.Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock as It Steals Snap Inc's (SNAP) ThunderSo instead of chasing price targets in MU stock, either of these setups will yield profits as long as MU stock stays above the risk. From current prices, we're leaving more than 25% room for error.Even though we're committing to longer-dated contracts, we can close our options trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Wednesday’s Vital Data: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL);3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are indicating a bit of a rebound from yesterday's losses, which is a bit surprising given the dearth of data set to wash over Wall Street in the next two days. While a rate hike from the Federal Reserve is already priced in, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen could still offer up a few surprises in her commentary on the Fed's rate path and the strength of the U.S. economy.makeArticleAd();What's more, there is a veritable flood of economic data on tap today, with the consumer price index, retail sales, the Empire State index as well as home builders and business inventories.In spite of this deluge of data, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere last seen higher by 0.17%, withS&P 500futures up 0.25% andNasdaq-100futures adding 0.21%.On the options front, Tuesday was another relatively low-volume session, as only about 12.5 million calls and 12.3 million puts changed hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio extended Monday's advance to arrive at 0.73, while the 10-day moving average settled in at 0.63.Turning to Tuesday's volume leaders,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) drew mixed options activity after VRX stock plunged on news that hedge fund manager and activist investor Bill Ackman has exited his holdings in the company. Elsewhere,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) saw renewed call options interest on Model Y rumors and a target hike from Deutsche Bank. Finally,Delta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) fell amid blizzard flight cancellations, but saw several large call bets looking for a rebound.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX)VRX stock plunged more than 10% on Tuesday following news that activist investor Bill Ackman's hedge fundcompletely closed out of its position in Valeant.7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually SafeThe timing of the news was particularly notable, coming just after the company initiated several new initiatives, including asset sales to help pay down debt. VRX shares are now trading just north of single-digit territory, an area the stock last flirted with in 2009.Option volume on VRX ramped up to more than 535,000 contracts following the news, with calls and puts nearly split on the day. This divided sentiment among VRX options traders extends over the short- to intermediate-term, as the April put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 1.06, with calls and puts in near parity. Currently, peak April call OI totals about 20,000 contracts at the overhead $20 strike, while peak put OI of 36,000 contracts rests at the in-the-money $12.50 strike.Tesla Inc (TSLA)While most of the report hinged on already-known data, a speculative report from a British car publication ignited rumors that Tesla could be set tolaunch a new compact SUV dubbed the Model Y. According to the report, the Model Y is based on the Model 3's platform and will be slightly more expensive than the Model 3. The report also concluded that, with the rising popularity of small SUVs in the U.S., ""the compact Model Y could turn out to be Tesla's best seller.""Meanwhile, TSLA stock received another boost afterDeutsche Bank lifted its price targeton the shares from $215 to $220. Driving the upgrade, Deutsche Bank said it believes Tesla could hit breakeven by the fourth quarter of this year and move into profitability in 2018 as the Model 3 ramps up volume. That said, the upgrade still represents a discount to TSLA's close north of $258 yesterday.While the pair of reports was enough to move TSLA stock nearly 5% higher, options traders were not as impressed. Sure, total volume rose to a near-term high of 345,000 contracts, but calls only managed to eke out 56% of the day's take. Looking out to the April series, TSLA options traders are just as stoic, with the put/call OI ratio ballooning to 1.31, with puts easily outnumbering calls on the month.TSLA options bulls have their sights set on the $270 strike, where more than 3,500 contracts currently reside, while the bears have targeted the $210 strike with 3,300 contracts.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)Blizzard-like conditions snarled air travel in the Northeast yesterday, forcing thecancellation of more than 5,000 flightsin New York, Boston and Washington D.C. In typical fashion, airline stocks were hit hard on the news, with the NYSE ARCA Airline Index dropping more than 2%. Delta shares were also punished, underperforming their peers with a 2.26% loss of altitude on the day.But options traders weren't having it. DAL saw volume soar to a near-term high of more than 254,000 contracts, with calls snapping up roughly 90% of the day's take - an outsized ratio that is more typically seen ahead of ex-dividend dates. But DAL's ex-div date passed late last month, meaning that options traders were buying up calls in earnest for another reason entirely.Can Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI) Reinvent Itself?Diving into data fromTrade-Alert.com, we find that several large block trades crossed at DAL's June $50 and $55 call strikes. While all of the trades crossed at separate times throughout the day, they all had the same basic design as the largest such trade, which involved 20,000 purchased June $50 calls and 20,000 sold June $55 puts - a bull call spread with an ask price of 94 cents, or $94 per contract, a break even of $50.94 and a maximum profit of $4.06, or $406 per pair of contracts.That's quite a return, if DAL can return to higher ground amid the summer travel season.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackThe postWednesday's Vital Data: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock as It Steals Snap Inc’s (SNAP) Thunder;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe cat is out of the bag.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is copyingSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), and it is doing it everywhere.makeArticleAd();First, it was Instagram Stories. Then it was WhatsApp Status. Now it's Messenger Day. With each copycat iteration, the chorus of bearish arguments against FB stock gets louder and louder. They are all pretty similar, and they go something like: ""Facebook is playing catch-up"" or ""Facebook isn't innovating"" or ""Snap will steal Facebook's users.""The market doesn't seem to be giving those arguments much credence. Facebook stock is up 13% since Instagram Stories launched and is currently at all-time highs. SNAP stock, meanwhile, is 25% off its post-IPO high and continues to make new lows.I think the market has it right on this one. Here's why.Facebook Stole Snap's ThunderOne thingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) taught the technology world is that you don't need to be first to market to succeed. The iPhone was far from the first smartphone to market. Apple let other companies introduce the concept and dabble in prototypes, then Apple leaped on the opportunity when the time was right.6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomIn other words, you don't have to be first. You just have to be better and have the right timing.Facebook is bigger, and in the social media world, that is better. The timing is also right for Facebook to be playing copycat.Scale is what has driven profits and driven FB stock higher. The entire Facebook ecosystem has tremendous scale. The main Facebook app has scale. Messenger has scale. Instagram has scale. WhatsApp has scale. This pervasive scale offers two advantages:Firstly, scale will convert Snap Story users into Facebook users. As thisMashablewriterpoints out, there is a certain broadcasting element to Snap and Instagram Stories. When you blast a picture or video out on social media for 24 hours, you do so with the intent of grabbing as many eyeballs as possible. Snap only has so many eyeballs. Instagram has more than two times as many eyeballs. Messenger has more than six times, and WhatsApp more than seven times.Secondly, scale will allow FB to grab users before they ever even migrate to Snap. Instagram Stories just rolled out internationally, where Snap only has some 90 million daily active users. Messenger and WhatsApp also have large international reach. As Instagram Stories, WhatsApp Status, and Messenger Day launch globally, it will be the first time many of their users have seen the ""Stories"" concept. To them, there is no copying or mimicking at work. Just a cool new feature on a favorite platform.The timing of Facebook's ""imitation game"" has also been pretty close to perfect.The concept of ephemeral media messaging, particularly the core concept of Stories, really took off in 2016. Snap saw its daily active user base grow from 107 million at the end of 2015 to 143 million by the middle of 2016.But then Instagram Stories launched in August 2016, and Snap's user growth slowed. Snap ended the year with only 158 million daily actives. That means the platform added 36 million users in the first half of 2016 but only 15 million in the second-half.Meanwhile, in just 25 weeks, Instagram Stories grew to150 million actives(the same size as Snap).What Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event?It looks like Instagram stole Snap's thunder in August, and rolled with it into the end of the year while Snap more or less flat-lined.Bottom Line on FB StockFacebook is playing copycat, and so far, it's working. Moreover, it likely will continue to work, and FB will only grow its user base and unit revenue as Snap fades into social media memory.All in all, FB stock has become a classic ""buy-the-dip"" situation with a secular growth story and a reasonable - but not great - valuation. At nearly 21 times next year's consensus earnings estimate, Facebook really isn't all the expensive. Earnings are actually expected to grow 28% this year and 23% next year, so the stock trades at a discount to its growth. That is rare for a hyper-growth tech company.Facebook also has more than $10 per share in cash on the balance sheet and generates consistently strong cash flows.For what it's worth, I'm not running to buy FB stock here near all-time highs. But Iamlooking to add to my position on any dips.As of the writing of this article, Luke Lango was long FB.More From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Report Changed the Game3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

What Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event?;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are three announcements we've been waiting forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) to make in the near future:makeArticleAd();A March special event to launch an upgraded 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Air replacement.A third iPad -an all new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with design cues from the iPhone 8- seems ready to go in May or June.The move-in date for its new Apple Park ""spaceship"" campus.A new report suggests the company is juggling the timelines and plans to hold an April Apple Event combining all three.New iPads Are OverdueApple's iPad lineup may not be doing the same business it once was, but it's still due for a refresh.The iPad Pro line aimed at prosumers is priced at a premium, helping to boost revenue for the division, but it competes against some tough adversaries, includingMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro. Apple is expected to release a next generation version of 2015's 12.9-inch iPad Pro to stay current.6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomAnall-new iPad Prothat is also expected in the late spring. This one is a 10.5-inch form factor, but it seems likely to borrow from the design of the upcoming iPhone 8, with an edge-to-edge display and virtual Home button. Doing so gives AAPL a physically smaller iPad Pro, with a display larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, making it more useful for professionals.The company is expected to also ship a replacement for the iPad Air 2, its full-sized consumer tablet that was released in 2014.The new iPad Air and 12.9-inch iPad Pro were expected to be unveiled in March, but with the month half-over, an April Apple event seems more likely.Such a move also jives with rumors back in January that AAPL might be experiencing somemanufacturing challenges that could result in a later release.New iPads Identified in the WildOn Monday,9to5 Macbroke the news that an analytics firm hasdetected the identifiers for new iPad models in app downloadsin the Cupertino area. The model numbers show up as iPad 7,1; iPad 7,2; iPad 7,3 and iPad 7,4 - current iPad models show up in logs as iPad 6,x.9to5 Macnotes that four new identifiers don't necessarily mean four new models, as an iPad equipped with LTE has different numbers than the same version in a Wi-Fi-only option.The new models first showed up last September, but the frequency accelerated rapidly in January and February, indicating the new iPads are getting close to being launch-ready.Apple Park Ready for Its Grand OpeningApple Park is AAPL's massive new headquarters, nicknamed the ""spaceship campus"" because of its round, futuristic design.Under construction since 2013, the massive building is 2/3 the size of the pentagon, packed with the latest green technology (including 17 megawatts of rooftop solar power generating capacity), features the world's largest curved glass panels and came with a $5 billion price tag.One of the features of Apple Park is the new Steve Jobs Theater - the site AAPL plans to use for new product launches.AAPL has already announced 12,000 employees will begin moving into Apple Park next month, so an April Apple Event of some sort to celebrate the opening of the new headquarters was already a given.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Report Changed the GameNew iPads and Apple Park to Converge for a Big April Apple Event?Putting all the pieces together will take some work on AAPL's part. That new 10.5-inch iPad Pro in particular could be problematic (it wasn't expected this early), but Applecouldshow it off and announce availability closer to summer. However, the stars appear to be aligning for whatDigitimesis reporting will be an April Apple event.Citing sources from within Apple's supply chain,DigitimessaysApple will show off its new iPads at a combined eventthat also inaugurates the new Apple HQ.2017 is shaping up to be a massive year for Apple - one that will culminate with the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 in September.It's fitting if the company kicks things off with the opening of its new headquarters, and the first new product launch at the Steve Jobs Theater.

3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

TheS&P 500 Indexlost 0.3%, theDow Jones Industrial Averagesuffered a 0.2% setback and theNasdaq Compositefell 0.3%.makeArticleAd();Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:ARNA) andFogo De Chao Inc(NASDAQ:FOGO) are among a few companies moving big-time on earnings this morning, thoughBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) might save its moving and shaking for this afternoon.Here's what you need to know heading into Wednesday's trading day:Bank of America Corp (BAC)BAC will be among numerous financial stocks anxiously awaiting what most believe is on the way:Another interest-rate hike from the Federal Reserve.The Fed, in fact, is expected by many analysts to raise rates three times this year, albeit likely by just a quarter-point each time. Still, that would mean big things for banks, which traditionally benefit from higher rates, as it tends to widen the net interest margin - the difference between what banks earn on other investments and what they pay out in deposits.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017Bank of America estimates that every 1-percentage-point hike in rates adds $3.4 billion to net interest income a year. That figure represents about a third of what it earned in Q4 of this year.Hopes for several rate hikes, along with an anti-regulation Trump administration, have lifted BAC stock and other financial equities over the past few months. BofA specifically is up more than 50% since the November election. However, some believe this could bea ""sell-the-news"" moment for Bank of America.Shares have leveled off a bit of late, trading roughly flat over the past week.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How “Model Y” Report Changed the Game;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied close to 5% on Tuesday on the back of a report saying the electric vehicle maker is planning on yet another new cardubbed the ""Model Y.""While to my knowledge, Tesla has yet to confirm or deny these rumors, the positive reaction in TSLA stock must be respected.makeArticleAd();From a technical analysis standpoint, Tesla stock bounced off important support that could offer traders and investors a good reference area around which to build their trades.It was only three weeks ago, on Feb. 22, when Tesla reported its latest batch of earnings. In response, investors sold off TSLA stock with both hands.Case in point? When I last mused about shares of Tesla onFeb. 24(the day following the initial reaction to the company's earnings report), I said that while TSLA remains an attractive longer-term growth story, technically speaking, it had reached the upper end of a longer-standing trading range and looked poised for a breather. I also offered that a mean-reversion move lower toward the $240 area looked to be in the cards.Just a few days later (Feb. 27), Tesla stock had reached its 50-day moving average near $242 - close enough to the $240 area, and enough to allow traders to take profits on any short positions.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017Before looking closer into the technical meaning of Tuesday's bounce, let's review the bigger picture.TSLA Stock ChartsLooking at the multiyear chart, we can see that despite selling pressure following the February earnings report and yesterday's bounce, Tesla shares remain largely in a well-defined yet wide trading range.Click to EnlargeMy contacts on Wall Street capital markets trading desks continue to point toward another possible round of capital raise by Tesla Inc as a next event to look for - then depending on how investors react, potentially scale back into the stock at a better size.As a former investment banker, I agree with my contacts that a capital raise would be a critical time to look at TSLA stock closely. Still, I have to also respect Tuesday's bounce.On the daily chart, we see that Tuesday's rally in TSLA stock took place at a technical juncture that I often refer to as a ""confluence area"" of support.Click to EnlargeNote the simple black diagonal resistance line, which the stock pierced above in January. This line now coincides with the yellow 50-day simple moving average - a moving average that for the past 12 months had been a good reference area for the stock.Through this lens, the pullback in TSLA shares over the past few weeks merely offered a retest of this former diagonal line of technical resistance. Now, following Tuesday's rally, this line may have become technical support.Sell Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Before the Rate Hike!While one day does not make a trend, the $240 area could now be used as a good reference area of support. Options players could consider selling out-of-the-money put spreads, which is a more conservative way to express an intermediate-term quasi-bullish view on the stock.Quicker traders could consider buying TSLA stock for a trade and see if it offers any follow-through buying in coming days toward the $270 area as a next upside target.Either way, the $240 area offers a good reference area for Tesla; if it breaks, then next support likely lies closer to the $220 area.Like what you see?

Tesla's Model 3 Reservation Count Likely Hasn't Changed Much;3/14/2017;"It's now been nearly a year sinceTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) provided its one and only disclosure on how many   Model 3 reservations it has collected. When Tesla conducted its   secondary offering last year, it confirmed that in the month and   a half following the Model 3 unveiling it had garnered 373,000   reservations as of May 15, 2016. Since then, numerous analysts   have asked for updates on this figure, which management has   declined to answer for fear that any updates would be needlessly   overscrutinized.There are only clues, but it looks like Tesla's total Model 3   reservation tally hasn't changed much over the past year.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Normal fluctuationsThe balance sheet line item to look at is customer deposits.   This figure naturally fluctuates as customers place deposits for   new vehicles, which are subsequently released when the vehicle is   delivered. Throughout 2014 and 2015, these fluctuations were   often in the $20 million to $30 million range.At $1,000 per reservation, the aforementioned 373,000 figure   from last year represents $373 million worth of deposits. Due to   the timing of the unveiling last year, which occurred on the very   last day of Q1 2016, not all deposits taken on March 31 were   captured in the corresponding balance sheet data due to credit   card and bank processing times. In other words, that $373 million   increase in deposits took place over two quarters in terms of   balance sheet dates.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.The difference between deposits on Dec. 31, 2015, and June 30,   2016, was $396.5 million, or that same $373 million and then some   within range of standard fluctuations. But since then, customer   deposits have not changed meaningfully beyond what would be   considered standard fluctuations. More specifically, CFO Jason   Wheeler attributed last quarter's sequential decline of $27   million to a large number of Model X Signature Series that were   delivered, which originally had higher deposits.This suggests that Tesla's total Model 3 reservation tally has   not changed much.That's not necessarily a bad thingTo be clear, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Wheeler   notes that Tesla does not ""want to make the line longer at this   point,"" and CEO Elon Musk said the company ""anti-sells"" the Model   3 for this reason. So the company is not actively trying to grow   the Model 3 line, and the first year's worth of production is   already effectively allocated to current reservation holders;   Tesla's site says new reservations won't deliver until ""mid 2018   or later.""The initial spike in reservations was certainly driven by   pent-up demand from enthusiast consumers that have long wanted a   Tesla but have been waiting for a more affordable option. For   consumers that are considering a wider range of brands for their   next vehicle purchase, there's little to no point in placing a   $1,000 deposit for a vehicle that won't be delivered for another   year or longer. It's easier to sit on the sidelines and see how   things play out, and see if Tesla can execute better in areas   like quality control and customer support.A longer line is also meaningless to Tesla if it's already   backlogged by over a year, and its main focus is ramping   production and addressing any early issues that arise (which is   why the first deliveries will go to employees in the Bay Area,   close to the Fremont factory). There would very likely be a   tendency among critics to spin a relatively unchanged reservation   count as a negative storyline, which may be what management is   trying to avoid by not giving updates.What matters most for the time being is just getting the   $35,000 electric vehicle out there.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Popped Today;3/14/2017;"Shares of TeslaTSLAgained more than 4.2% in afternoon trading Tuesday after a speculative report from a British car publication fueled rumors that the electric vehicle manufacturer is set to launch a new compact SUV.This new speculation was caused by a story published byAutocardetailing the Model Y, a rumored compact crossover that is reportedly based on the same platform as Tesla's new affordable Model 3. According to the report, the Model Y is ""expected to be slightly more expensive"" than the Model 3.Citing the popularity of crossovers throughout the U.S, the story claims that ""the compact Model Y could turn out to be Tesla's best seller."" The website even generated their own mockup of what the new car would look like, and its sleek design cannot be overstated.The only problem is that the report seems to be based on absolutely no new information. In his updated ""Master Plan"" published on Tesla's ownwebsitethis past summer, Elon Musk detailed his goal to ""address most of the consumer market"" with the Model 3, as well as ""a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck.""So we've already known that a compact SUV is in Tesla's future. Throw in an obvious observation that the new car will probably cost more than the Model 3, speculate that it will be a bestseller based on the popularity of similar vehicles, and boom-you've got yourself a story that looks powerful enough to move this stock.In reality, if the Model Y starts production in late 2018 as Autocar suggests, it will be behind several other comparable compact electric SUVs.And that's not even mentioning the fact that Musk's brief mention of a compact SUV was sandwiched in between his plans to shake up the energy storage market and his aspirations to revolutionize trucking and public transportation.In the new Master Plan, Musk said that, outside of consumer vehicles, ""there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport.""He also claimed that both are in the early stages of development and should be ready to be unveiled in 2017.So maybe that's what we should be looking forward to next?Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Is This Why Tesla Shares Jumped Today?;3/14/2017;"It's a relatively slow news day forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , yet shares have jumped over $11, or 4.5%, as of   this writing. While theIntelandMobileyedeallikely pushes up comparable valuations for any company involved   in autonomous driving technology -- given the incredible premium   that the chipmaker is paying for a company that was already very   richly valued to begin with -- that deal was announced yesterday,   so is unlikely to be driving today's gains.OopsIt seems more probable that the market is reacting favorably   to a MarketWatch article published earlier in the day that   claimed, ""Small SUV coming next year from Tesla,"" citing a report fromAutocar. Unfortunately, MarketWatch appears to be mistaken.MarketWatch, which has a much larger following than the   smaller British automotive magazine, states: ""The Model Y would   be unveiled 'sometime next year,' the magazine said, with   production slated for later in the year. It is likely to have the   same top-hinged doors as the full-size Model X, it said."" But   Autocar never actually claims this, nor does it cite any sources   that might be privy to the Model Y's unveiling.makeArticleAd();Tesla's current SUV, the Model X. Image source: Tesla.Instead, Autocar merely says, ""The Model Y is unlikely to be   unveiled until some time next year, with production set to follow   late in the year."" Saying the vehicle is ""unlikely to be unveiled   until some time next year"" isnotthe same as ""would be unveiled"" next year or that it is ""coming   next year."" There seems to be some inadvertent semantic confusion   on MarketWatch's part, but that's not stopping shares from   jumping on the prospect of Tesla's electric compact SUV; Autocar   is mostly just reiterating all of the prevalent (and already   known) Model Y rumors.Sorry, investors. Nothing to see here.Model Y will be important, but it's probably farther outThat being said, Tesla certainly is working on a compact SUV.   CEO Elon Musk has casually discussed the Model Y on many   occasions over the years, and then formally committed on paper to   ""a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck"" in hisMaster Plan, Part Deuxblog post last July. The Model Y's potential is arguably even   greater than the Model 3, given the secular shift away from   sedans toward crossovers and compact SUVs that the market has   been experiencing for many years and remains ongoing. That trend   isn't going away anytime soon.Here's a snapshot of last month's auto sales data.Vehicle CategoryFebruary 2017 Unit SalesChange (YOY)Midsize cars229,000(15%)Small cars206,000(10%)Luxury cars67,000(8%)Crossover396,00012%Midsize SUV80,000(4%)Large SUV27,00028%Small SUV19,00011%Luxury SUV18,0001%Data source: Motor Intelligence viaWSJ.Figures rounded.Getting into the mainstream compact SUV market will be an   important milestone eventually, but it's extremely unlikely that   Tesla is anywhere near ready to unveil the Model Y, given how   long automotive design, testing, and validation cycles are and   the simple fact that Model 3 is the top priority right now. For   reference, Model S and Model X launched three years apart. It   would also be unwise to distract potential Model 3 customers that   might rather wait for a Model Y, possibly resulting in lost   sales.Model Y is in the pipeline, but probably not so soon.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

NVIDIA or Intel: Which Is Better for Driverless Car Investors?;3/14/2017;"Self-driving cars, once the stuff of science fiction movies, are set to become a reality soon. Already many driver-assist features, such as lane changing, traffic jam assistant and others, are being offered by automakers. Such features are, essentially, stepping stones to autonomous driving technology.By definition, an autonomous vehicle is a car that is able to take on the primary transportation capabilities of a driver-controlled car. It can sense its surrounding environment and navigate that space without the involvement of humans. Technology like radar, lidar, GPS and computer vision help the cars accomplish this feat.Nearly all automakers are now in various stages of developing self-driving cars. Some have even started testing them on public roads. Although bringing these cars to market will take years, it is obvious that driverless cars have a place in the future of the technology industry. Thus, long-term investors interested in the technology sector would be well-advised to invest in stocks that look set to gain from this trend. Since the market is dominated by a few large players, it makes sense to weigh the pros and cons before investing.Huge Growth Potential of the IndustryAccording to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.These estimates encourage us about NVIDIA Corp.NVDAand Intel Corp's.INTCgrowth prospects in the space. With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced technologies for self-diving cars, we believe that the two companies is well poised to capitalize on this opportunity. Both these companies have generated high returns for investors so far and have the potential to exceed expectations in the days ahead.NVIDIA Vs. IntelNVIDIA and Intel are two big players within the driverless car space.Intel recently struck a deal to acquire driver assistance technology company Mobileye N.V.MBLYfor roughly $15.3 billion. The deal marks the next step in the driverless car race.Intel plans on integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's renowned operations, and the combined entity will be run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua. The deal will combine Intel's processors with Mobileye's renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that's solely focused on the self-driving market.Intel's $15.3 billion acquisition is the biggest ever for an Israeli technology company. The move positions Intel as a ""leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,"" according to a company statement Monday. ""Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.""The deal comes afterMobileye partneredwith self-driving technology company Delphi Automotive in Aug. 2016. The two companies planned to create an affordable self-driving car platform to sell to carmakers by 2019. In Nov. 2016,Intel announcedthat Mobileye and Delphi would use its processors. Intel, Mobileye and German automaker BMW AG partnered to test 40 self-driving cars, which could possibly lead to production by 2021.Intel's purchase helps the technology giant begin to compete in therace towards autonomous car technology.In January, Intel announced it would purchase a 15% stake in digital mapmaker Here International B.V., joining BMW AG and Volkswagen AG'sVLKAYAudi, to further the development in the real-time technology needed to improve self-driving car technology.With these types of partnerships in mind, Intel and Mobileye's biggest competitor going forward will be NVIDIA and its collaboration with Tesla Inc.TSLA. NVIDIA is best known for its gaming and smartphone graphics chips, but like Intel, the company has been developing computing hardware for cars.NVIDIA's foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space has also been driving the stock higher since mid-2015. It should be noted that during the last reported quarter (fourth quarter of fiscal 2017), the company witnessed a 38% year-over-year jump in automotive segment revenues, mainly driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars.Notably, during the 2017 CES event, the company announced two important collaborations - with HERE and ZENRIN - that will expand the Live Map capabilities of autonomous vehicles Apart from this, the company announced an extension of its decade-long partnership with Audi. The two companies have now decided to put advanced AI cars on the road starting 2020.It should be noted that NVIDIA forayed into autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronics space in 2015 by launching a computer vision system at the CES. It hasn't looked back since then and has been continuously bringing new and more advanced technologies in the space.At the beginning of 2016, NVIDIA launched DRIVE PX 2 - the world's most powerful engine for in-vehicle AI. In Sep 2016, the graphic chip behemoth unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Amsterdam. With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, we believe that the company is well poised to become a leading provider of technology for autonomous vehicles.Notably, since 2015, NVIDIA has been providing various autonomous technologies such as digital instrument clusters, navigation, advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment under its partnerships with several automakers including HondaHMC, Tesla Motors, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.Therefore, we believe that the recent permit to test its driverless cars will encourage various other auto manufacturers to use NVIDIA's processing units in their autonomous driving systems.For years, these two companies have battled each other for market share and brand recognition in every conceivable way.Which Stock to Choose?Share priceNVIDIA, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of 2016 and has gained 216.9% in the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorizedSemiconductor-Generalindustry's return of just about 39.9%.We note that Intel, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry in the past one year. While the company's shares gained 10.9%, the industry returned 38.9% in the same period. Moreover, we don't expect the shares to rebound in the near term.Estimate RevisionsOver the past month, NVIDIA's current quarter estimates have risen from 63 cents per share to 67 cents per share and current year estimates have risen from $2.69 per share to $2.79 per share.While Intel's current quarter estimates over the past one month have not shown any movement and is pegged at 65 cents. However, current year estimates have risen from $2.79 per share to $2.89 per share, over the same time frame.Style Score, EPS Growth Rate, Market CapNVIDIA has a Growth Style Score of ""A"" with a long-term expected growth rate of 10.3%. The company has a market cap of $58.38 billion.Intel has a Growth Style Score of ""B"" with a long-term expected growth rate of 8.42%. The company has a market cap of $169.78 billion.ConclusionThese two stocks have grabbed the spotlight with striking performances on the back of solid earnings results and strong growth projections, with their share of pros and cons. But given the current scenario, we would bet on NVIDIA because it is well-positioned to outpace the industry and is fundamentally strong enough to withstand risks. Also, NVIDIA was one of the hottest stocks in the S&P 500 last year, and there's a very good chance it could perform that way again in 2017.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Mobileye NV (MBLY) Didn’t Come Cheap. Here’s Why;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAsk ten shareholders what they think of the this week's decision fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) to acquireMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) and you'll get ten different answers. Most of those answers, however, won't be terribly favorable opinions regarding the deal.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockEither the iconic chipmaker overpaid for Mobileye shares, or Intel has no business leaving its comfort zone (CPUs and chipsets), or both. Besides, long-term INTC owners know the company doesn't have the best track record when it comes to making acquisitions.There's a certain ""crazy like a fox"" quality to this purchase, though. Intel stock holders may want to take a step back and look at the same long-term picture CEO Brian Krzanich is seeing.Not OptimisticOn Monday, tech-giant Intel announced it was acquiring Mobileye - the maker of the ""eyes"" used by self-driving and auto-braking automobiles -for $63.54 per share of MBLY, or $15.3 billion in all.That's a 45% premium to Friday's closing trade! But perhaps more concerning is that at $15.3 billion,Intel will be paying 42.7 times last year's salesand 141.7 times 2016's income from Mobileye. Both are on the order of ten times the norm.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017Analysts were mixed on the matter, although a few were particularly optimistic. Perhaps the most bullish view came from Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann,who explained:""Intel is seeking relevance in automotive with the Mobileye acquisition in a market that is moving at a faster-than-expected pace. The acquisition is in line with the Altera acquisition in that it is defensive in nature and meant to defend Intel's historical CPU (central processing unit) incumbency from various accelerator technologies.""At the more pessimistic end of the scale, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry opined:""Basically, Intel has now inherited Mobileye's problems, and we don't think Intel has the capacity to fix Mobileye's issues.""All those views may be too short-sighted, however.What Intel Sees in MobileyeKrzanichjustified the decisionto INTC shareholders by saying:""It's important now, because if you take a look at what you're doing - talking about car models in 2020, 2021 - and so we need to get in there. We need to get this platform developed, brought to them, and have that confidence so that we can really influence the real start of autonomous driving in that time frame.""He's right, in all ways.He's right in the sense that although self-driving cars aren't exactly new, the market isn't gelled yet - there's room for new players to step up and shape what the future of autonomous driving looks like. Better for Intel to shape it on its terms then end up chasing the lead pace set by the likes ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).He's also right in the sense that by 2020/2021, the landscape of the self-driving car market is going to look radically different. Not only will the market leaders be well-entrenched by then, there's going to massive growth in the number of autonomous cars on the road by that time.How massive? BCG recently crunched some numbers, concluding thatby 2035 annual sales of fully autonomous vehicles will reach 12 million. Annual sales of partially-autonomous cars will rise to 18 million by that point.Investors won't have to wait that long to see big-time growth, though. BCG thinks the market will be worth $42 billion by 2025, and grow to $77 billion by 2035. At the end of the timeframe, roughly a fourth of all new cars sold will offer autonomous driving features.In a separate study, Lux Research concluded that,by 2030, the self-driving automobile market will be worth $87 billion. Lux added that software developers will be the biggest winners of the movement. Making the hardware work is the hard part.With Mobileye now under its wing, Intel has access to a full-blown platform - complete with software - it didn't have before.Bottom Line for INTC StockIt's not a deal that's going to pay dividends (literally or figuratively) tomorrow, or even next year. Give it two years, though, or even five years for the autonomous car market to mature. It's coming, and it's going to be big. It's far easier and far more affordable for Intel to stake its claim now than it will be to try and break into the market later.Tesla: Trade TSLA With Less RiskIf nothing else, Intel wanted to make sure it made Mobileye its own rather than risk letting a competitor get hold of the up-and-coming company. The value will be there eventually.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills7 Huge M&A Deals That Should Happen ImmediatelyThe postMobileye NV (MBLY) Didn't Come Cheap.

Can Intel Catch Tesla, Google, Apple In Autonomous Car Race?;3/14/2017;"Thanks to its$15.3 billion acquisitionof Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY), Intel (INTC) is no longer on the outside looking in when it comes to the autonomous car market, which has become the new battleground for high-tech companies looking new revenue streams.While Intel’s semiconductor prowess and breadth in R&D should accelerate the pace of Mobileye’s technology innovation, will the combined company have enough tread to catch the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL)?Intel seems to think so. The deal, which sent MBLY stock soaring 28% in active trade Monday, ""merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a statement. “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.”makeArticleAd();Investors weren’t immediately impressed, sending Intel shares down 2.1% to close at a three-month low of $35.16. This isn’t Intel’s first run at self-driving cars, however. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant, through its financing arm Intel Capital, hasspent $250 millionin R&D looking for an edge. The Mobileye deal, meanwhile, has now made it known that autonomous driving capabilities was never a hobby for Intel. It’s become a critical market for the company.Still, Tesla and Google won’t be run off the road. In December, GooglelaunchedWaymo, which stands for “a new way forward in mobility.” Waymo’s website features a two-seater prototype fitted with Google’s hardware and software that is built to move with the touch of a button, with neither a steering wheel nor a brake pedal. Meanwhile, in Tesla’s most popular sedan, the Model S, the company has already rolled out self-driving capabilities that receive incremental updates on autopilot features.These updates, which include “exit ramp autonomy” on highways, automatic lane-changing, and auto-steering, are also available to Model X, its SUV family. And to say nothing about Apple’s (AAPL) own autonomous car ambitions, which theWall Street Journalrecently confirmed. With more money stashed than the U.S. Treasury, Apple’s autonomous car position depends only on how hard it wants to mash the accelerator.But here’s the thing: Mobileye was once a prominent partner to Tesla, meaning it could have had first-hand knowledge of what Tesla has under its hood. And to the extent Intel can utilize that knowledge to accelerate its own technology, Intel will narrow that gap relatively quickly.At the same time, the fact that Intel wants to emerge as the go-to chip name when it comes to autonomous car processors, powering functions such as displays and communication between two self-driving vehicles, Intel doesn’t necessarily have to be the car, it can just be the brainsinsidethe car — something it thrived on during the height of the PC era."

1 Chart That Suggests Tesla Needs to Invest More in Support Infrastructure;3/14/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has an ambitious and compelling vision of vertically integrating sales and service. Hatred of the traditional car buying experience is universal, and service departments at dealerships aremajor profit centers. But pulling off the execution of that vision is far easier said than done, and requires significant investments in infrastructure as well as talent. No one should ever have to wait nearlyeight monthsto get their car repaired.Digging through Tesla's SEC filings, there are data points that could suggest that Tesla needs to be investing more aggressively in customer support.makeArticleAd();Tesla technicians performing service on a Model S. Image source: Tesla.A numbers gameFair warning: This will be an imperfect analysis, mostly due to imperfect public data. First, I took a look at cumulative vehicle shipments over time, excluding the original Roadster that only sold about 2,500 units. While cumulative unit sales are generally not a great proxy for installed base because some units are inevitably retired over time, Tesla's cumulative unit sales may be closer than other examples since cars tend to have longer useful lives and the company only started shipping the Model S less than five years ago. This isn't a small consumer electronics device that you get rid of after two years. It's not perfect, but it's the closest proxy we can get.Tesla also reports the total number of sales and service locations that it operates. It would be more useful to distinguish between sales and service, but for reporting purposes the company aggregates all locations. Third-party authorized body shops are not included in these figures, as Tesla does not report how large its network is. Here's a chart of both cumulative unit sales and Tesla stores and service centers over the past five years.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.However, if you divide cumulative unit sales by Tesla-operated locations, then it starts to make sense why Tesla's support infrastructure is somewhat strained right now. Cumulative units per location rose from 91.5 in 2012 to 693.2 in 2016.Data source: SEC filings and author's calculations. Chart by author.Again, this analysis is less than ideal since investors only have Tesla's public disclosures to work with. It does not account for geographical differences or concentrations, it cannot distinguish between sales and service locations, and the installed base is certainly less than the roughly 184,000 Model S and Model X vehicles that Tesla has delivered through the end of 2016. It's also not as if locations should scale linearly with deliveries. But directionally on average, it stands to reason that Tesla's support infrastructure growth has not kept pace with delivery growth, which in turn leads to backlogs within the network.It's also worth noting that Tesla measures many other internal metrics to assess service quality -- metrics that public investors are not privy to. For example, head of sales and service Jon McNeillrecently notedthat 20% of jobs at Tesla's Palo Alto center are completed before the customer can finish a cup of coffee, and that Tesla's overall parts backlog has been reduced by over 80%. These are also important data points, but they aren't the sort that investors get regular updates on.Model 3 will need even greater supportMeanwhile, Tesla does not break out its capital spending in detail, either, so it's hard to gauge how much the company is investing in support infrastructure. It goes without saying that areas like Gigafactory and Model 3 tooling are the top priorities, but beyond that it's less clear. Here's CFO Jason Wheeler, who recently announced he was leaving Tesla to pursue opportunities in public policy, responding to an analyst question on capital expenditure categories on the last earnings call:We don't break down, we don't disclose the specifics here, but obviously Gigafactory and Model 3 are going to be the biggest investments. We've also got CapEx investments soon, equipment and tooling related to Model 3. But then also there's going to be a piece in CapEx on building out our service and our retail infrastructure as well. And the Supercharger network. So it is the usual suspects.Given the looming Model 3 production ramp that remains on track, perhaps Tesla should be allocating more capital expenditures to expanding support infrastructure.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Intel Needed To Own Mobileye - Even If It Overpaid;3/14/2017;"Painfully, Intel (INTC) has little to no presence in mobile devices, save for a few modem chips here and there. Most everything on mobile devices is ARM-based due to its lower power consumption and cheaper costs. Intel and its -x86 platform simply cannot compete on price or power performance.Having realized this, Intel has decided to do what any company in its position should do -- try and buy its way into the future, acquiring Mobileye (MBLY) for $15.3 billion.No Matter the CostmakeArticleAd();The acquisition, which is being billed as helping Intel turn into a data company (whatever that means), isn't likely to move the financial needle for Intel anytime soon.Mobileye generated just $240.6 million in revenue in fiscal 2016. By comparison, Intel's full year revenue was $59.4 BILLION and its Data Center Group (which Intel is saying Mobileye will fit into) had $17.2 billion in sales.The Israeli-based Mobileye generated $108.4 million in GAAP net income in 2016, making the deal worth 141 times net income. That isn't exactly cheap, even if Mobileye is growing revenues at 46% year over year.This deal is about the future of the car, one that will generate more data (thus needing more computing power) than at any time in history. Intel said cars could generate as much as four terabytes of data per day, so it's important cars have the computing power to understand and make sense of all that data.Mobileye is best known for its role in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), having worked with companies like Tesla (TSLA), GM (GM), BMW (in conjunction with Intel) and others to bring self-driving cars to the forefront. (In 2017, another 6 OEMs will come online using Mobileye's chips, according to Jefferies analyst David Kelley.)Limited ImpactThis deal isn't likely to hurt Nvidia (NVDA), which makes GPUs for self-driving cars or Qualcomm (QCOM) or NXP (NXPI), which also makes chipsets for cars. Chips for ADAS systems and the cameras that go into them is a much smaller market than being the brains of a self-driving car platform. However, it's clear that Intel needed to do something to get into this space, or risk losing out like it did with mobile devices.There is still the risk that car manufacturers will cut Mobileye's units out of its cars (as happened with Tesla), but with Intel's muscle behind it, that seems less likely to happen. Mobileye has deals with a number of auto manufacturers, including Volkswagen and BMW, enough to get its EyeQ chips into 16 million cars by the end of 2016.Ultimately, this is a deal Intel had to do. It missed out on buying Nvidia when it should have, as it was too focused on the Altera acquisition. It can't buy AMD (AMD) because of the implications for the PC market and -x86 chips.The PC market has had little to no growth for quite some time now, leading PC chip makers to wonder what's next. Intel's latest acquisition of automotive chip maker Mobileye shows that under Brian Krzanich, Intel is focusing on the future -- no matter what it costs."

About to Buy Driverless Car Stocks? Read This First;3/13/2017;"There's no shortage of technology companies and automotive   makers that are are betting that autonomous vehicles will   transform both of their industries. But how do you figure   out which companies are poised to benefit the most?To answer that, investors first need to know what the market   potential is for driverless cars, what might slow it down, and   how long it will take for the segment to mature, and then   determine which driverless car investment angle they want to   take. Here are a few steps to help you get started:Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();How much the driverless car market will be     worthBy 2025, the driverless car market is expected to be worth $42   billion, according to Boston Consulting Group. The market size   jumps up to $77 billion by 2035, which is the same year thatIHSestimates that there will be 76 million autonomous vehicles   already on the road.And it doesn't end there. Driverless cars are expected to   transform ride sharing services, allow car owners to rent out   their own vehicles -- asTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has suggested -- and even help   traditional carmakers create their own ride hailing services,   likeFord(NYSE: F) has proposed.This might slow driverless car stocks downIt's not going to be all sunshine and lollipops for driverless   car stocks though. There are still many hurdles facing these   companies, including federal regulations, safety concerns, and   consumer adoption issues.The two biggest automotive markets, however -- the U.S. and   China -- have thus far been very open to driverless cars. Back in   September, the federal government released guidelines for states   to help ensure that companies are able to innovate and not be   hampered by differing rules across state lines. But the problem   is that we're still in the very early stages of driverless   car technology (i.e. neither you nor I can buy fully autonomous   vehicles), so while the government is open to it now, that could   change when more tech starts being used by the general   population.And even if the government doesn't end up stifling autonomous   vehicles, there's currently a growing movement toban driverless cars in New Yorkbecause people are afraid they'll eliminate jobs for taxi   drivers, bus drivers and others in the transportation sector. Add   to that the fact that there are parts of the population thatfeel very uneasyabout driverless cars and it's clear that the autonomous vehicle   market still has a long way to go.There are plenty of ways to investCompanies like Tesla are among the obvious choices for betting   on driverless cars. CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to have a   fully autonomous car capable of driving itself across the country   by 2018, and every new Tesla built right now already has the   hardware capabilities for full autonomy (though not all of the   software is activated).Tech behemothAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another clear choice. Google's   parent company recently spun out its driverless car segment into   its own company,called Waymo, and is working to bring fully autonomous minivans to the roads   this year for public testing, along with a ride-sharing   service.And then there are chipmakers likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , which is investing heavily in artificial   intelligence and its own supercomputers to power driverless cars.   The company'sDrive PX 2 supercomputeris already used by 80 automakers and automotive suppliers   (including Tesla) and is likely to expand its automotive revenues   substantially in the coming years.Of course, you could go the traditional route too and bet on   automakers like Ford, which is also focusing its attention on   self-driving technologies. The company recently invested $1   billion in a self-driving car start-up, called Argo AI, and says   that it will release its own fully autonomous vehicle (with no   steering wheel!) by 2021.Ford may be taking a slower approach than some other   self-driving tech makers, but it has plans to have 90   self-driving test vehicles on the road this year and is working   with more than 40 start-ups on driverless car technology.And if you're looking for a driverless car stock outside of   the U.S., thenBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU)  isprobably your best bet. The company has been developing self-driving technology for   years and just launched a test program in some Chinese cities to   implement its tech. The company wants to release a fully   self-driving car by next year with the hopes of having a   ride-hailing service in the coming years. Aside from its   aggressive driverless car approach, Baidu benefits from China's   openness to self-driving technologies and fewer regulations for   road tests than the U.S.Here's how long you might need to wait for this to play     outAlright, so now we know how big this market will be, some of   the potential hurdles, and who the key players are. So how long   will investors have to wait for this opportunity to pan out? IHS   estimates that we'll reach worldwide driverless car ubiquity by   about 2050.That doesn't mean it'll take that long for driverless car   stocks to benefit of course, but it does mean that we still have   a long way to go before the market will mature -- which makes now   the perfect time for investors to start considering driverless   car stocks.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Nvidia wasn't one of     them!

Will NVIDIA Stock Benefit from Intel's Acquisition of Mobileye?;3/13/2017;"When semiconductor chip maker Intel Corp.INTCannounced its acquisitionof Israeli self-driving car firm Mobileye NVMBLY, it sent shock waves through the tech, automaker, and driverless car industries. The deal will combine Intel's processors with Mobileye's renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that's solely focused on the self-driving market.Intel and Mobileye have a storied past, working together on various projects in the past. Last July, the two companies announced a partnership with BMW with the goal of putting autonomous cars on the streets by 2021, and then in November, they partnered with auto parts maker DelphiDLPHto create the Automated Driving Group, building a self-driving car system that can be sold to automakers.With this type of partnership in mind, Intel and Mobileye's biggest competitor going forward will be NVIDIA Corp.NVDAand its collaboration with Tesla Inc.TSLA. NVIDIA is best known for its gaming and smartphone graphics chips, but like Intel, the company has been developing computing hardware for cars.Last September, NVIDIA announced its Xavier supercomputer chip, which is powered by the 512-core Volta GPU intended for use in self-driving vars. The chip maker also announced its PX 2 water-cooled ""supercomputer,"" which Tesla employs in its electric vehicles.NVIDIA works closely with Volkswagen'sVLKAYAudi unit and Daimler AGDDAIFwithin the driverless car industry, too.So, what does this mean for NVDA stock?Just today, shares of NVDA closed up 2.75% to $101.85 per share, and though the stock has stumbled a bit in 2017, it has absolutely skyrocketed over the past one, three, and five years, up 207%, 441%, and 580%, respectively.Today's upward movement could be because investors are betting that Intel's Mobileye buyout is validation of the driverless industry as a whole, as well as NVIDIA's ""own dominance and expertise in the autonomous driving sector,""notesForbes.NVIDIA was one of the hottest stocks in the S&P 500 last year, and there's a very good chance it could perform that way again in 2017.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Self-Driving Car Race: Intel Buys Mobileye for $15 Billion;3/13/2017;"Intel CorporationINTCon Monday announced it struck a deal to acquire driver assistance technology company Mobileye N.V.MBLYfor roughly $15.3 billion. The deal marks the next step in the driverless car race.Mobileye's stock is up 29.43% in early afternoon trading on Monday to $61.19 per share, near its all-time high. Intel's stock dropped 2.31% to $35.08 per share.Mobileye specializes in chip-based camera systems called ""artificial vision sensors."" The technology alerts drivers in real-time to potential road hazards, like pedestrians. The company claims that the sensor technology is 99% accurate and helps prevent accidents. It is working towards putting this technology into self-driving car technology in the future. Mobileye currently helps support over 15 million vehicles.Israel-based Mobileye was founded in 1999 and it went public in July 2014. The IPO came after Mobileye began to invest in driverless car technology. The company'scurrent market capis nearly $10.5 billion. In amemo to employees, Mobileye executives said Intel's existing automated-driving efforts will be integrated into the company, and existing Israel leaders will head up the efforts.Intel's $15.3 billion acquisition is the biggest ever for an Israeli technology company. The move positions Intel as a ""leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,"" according to a company statement Monday. ""Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.""Mobileye previously worked with Tesla, Inc.TSLAto help power the electric carmaker's Autopilot technology. Thetwo companies parted waysafter a Tesla driver died in a car crash on May 7, 2016, while using its Autopilot feature.The deal comes afterMobileye partneredwith self-driving technology company Delphi Automotive in Aug. 2016. The two companies plannedto create an affordable self-driving car platform to sell to carmakers by 2019. In Nov. 2016,Intel announcedthat Mobileye and Delphi would use its processors.Intel, Mobileye and German automaker BMW AG partnered to test 40 self-driving cars, which could possibly lead to production by 2021.Intel's purchase helps the technology giant begin to compete in therace towards autonomous car technology.Last year, in the self-driving race, General MotorsGMspent $1 billion to purchase Cruise Automation. Uber recently bought self-driving truck maker Otto for $680 million. QUALCOMM IncorporatedQCOM, an Intel competitor, recently bought NXP Semiconductors N.V.NXPI, a leading semiconductor supplier to the automotive industry.In Nov. 2016, Samsung Electronics Co. bought Harman International Industries Inc. for $8 billion to move into the automotive vehicle space.Waymo, the self-driving car company that split off from Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.GOOG,asked a federal courtrecently to stop Uber Technologies Inc.'s from developing autonomous vehicles. Waymo claims that Uber stole proprietary design secrets. The lawsuit states that a former manager of Google's self-driving car project took documents before quitting to start the self-driving truck company Otto, which Uber acquired quickly.Intel bought security-software company McAfee Inc. for $7.7 billion in 2011. The company sold McAfee for a major loss in 2016.After missing out on the rise of the smartphone, Intel has fought to try and stay ahead of the next big technology. Intel is betting big on driverless car technology. The company purchased Israel-based 3D video technology company Replay Technologies in March 2016.Intel announcedin April 2016 it would lay off 11% of its workforce to in order to cut costs and to free up capital to invest in new businesses. In January, Intel announced it would purchase a 15% stake in digital mapmaker Here International B.V., joining BMW AG and Volkswagen AG'sVLKAYAudi, to further the development in the real-time technology needed to improve self-driving car technology.Auto part suppliers are doing well today in the wake of the Intel and Mobileye deal. Lear Corporation'sLEAstock is 1.30% to $46.36+ per share Monday, an all-time high. Delphi'sDLPHstock is up 3.37% to $79.69 per share. Visteon Corporation'sVCstock is up 5.58% to $98.77 per share.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.makeArticleAd();Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2 Things Tesla Is Doing to Improve Body Repair Times;3/13/2017;"Long body repair times are unfortunately all too common forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) customers. Third-party body shops often attribute   delays to waiting on parts from Tesla, while Tesla in some cases   says the body shops are responsible for the delays. My own body   repair experience was terrible, lasting acouple days shy of eight months, and Tesla's response provided toElectrekmostly attempted to pin blame on the body shop.Beyond my specific case, the broader issue is that Tesla's   support infrastructure for body repairs is strained. But the good   news is that Tesla is planning on making some much-needed   improvements to how repairs are handled.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();""applying brute force""In a thread on Tesla Motors Club regarding my article, Tesla   President of Global Sales and Service Jon McNeillposted a responseand outlined a ""roadmap"" for improvement. McNeill noted two   important things that Tesla is planning on doing to improve the   situation (emphasis added):We know from complaints that the body shop experience needs     to get a lot better -- and fast.What the service team has done so far is a roadmap of how     we're going to fix the autobody experience. Wait times for     appointments measured in hours and a handful of days currently.     We're providing same-day service from the Bay Area to Oslo and     everywhere in between. In fact, almost 20% of jobs in our     flagship center in Palo Alto are handled before the customer     can finish their cup of coffee (yes, you read that correctly).Thankfully, only a handful of our owners experience accidents     each year. Since customers schedule and interface with the body     shops on their own, we're largely blind to the service pace.Most of the customer complaints about body shops mentioned     parts, so we focused on this issue. To date, we've reduced     backlog by over 80%.Even though we reduced part wait times, we continued to dig     into the body shop complaints. What we found was astounding --     cars sat at body shops for weeks and sometimes months before     the body shops took action and, more often than not, the body     shops blaming Tesla for parts delays were the very shops that     hadn't even ordered parts or started the repair.We are applying brute force to this immediately.We will have individuals on our team personally manage     each car on behalf of our customers that are in 3rd party body     shops.We're also going to increase our approved shop count by     300 over the next few weeks as well as eliminating poor     performing shops.If you have an issue with a shop, please PM me directly and our     team will advocate and manage your repair.Tesla owners will get the service they expect from us - period.Thanks to the entire service team for their commitment to     setting the highest standard for service in the industry,JonPart of the issue is that since these are third-party body   shops, Tesla has less visibility into the repair timelines. In   order to mitigate this, Tesla will have employees manage the   repair to ensure that everything is proceeding promptly. Having   an advocate should relieve customers of having to try to navigate   the repair. Perhaps more importantly, Tesla is preparing to add   300 authorized body shops to its network in coming weeks, which   should help alleviate backlogs at body shops. It's not clear how   many third-party authorized body shops Tesla currently has, but   adding more will certainly help.Strengthening the customer support infrastructure is extremely   important ahead of Model 3's launch later this year. Tesla has   learned its lessons from making Model S and Model X overly   complicated, which is why it is taking a more holistic approach   to Model 3 by designing the car from the beginning for both   manufacturability and reparability.Tesla is planning on ordering enough parts from suppliers to   start producing 1,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in July, and this   will quickly ramp to 2,000 per week in August and 4,000 per week   in September. By the end of the year, Tesla hopes to be producing   5,000 per week, which would translate into an annual run rate of   over a quarter million vehicles as it enters 2018. In contrast,   Tesla produced approximately 84,000 vehicles in 2016. That's a   lot more vehicles on the road to support, so getting ahead of   service and repair times will be a key factor in whether or not   the mainstream model succeeds.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This is a bullish trade that commits me to buying F stock if price falls below it. I have an 85% theoretical chance of having F stock stay above my sold put. I only sell naked puts if I am willing to own it there.Taking both trades means that I am getting paid to bet on a Ford stock rally. Even if nothing happens, I would be left with a net credit. As long as the price stays above $11 per share, any premium I collect from selling back the May call is pure profit.Since I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration, I can close any of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

The Simple Reason Why I Won't Buy Tesla;3/11/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is, arguably, the quintissential story stock. I   know, I know... that's not exactly a revelation at this point.   Elon Musk set out to create a world powered by renewable energy   and filled with electric vehicles, told us about how great it   would be, made itsexy, and now we can't get enough of the vision. But it has its   drawbacks -- such as having an impossible-to-justify   valuation.When confronted with Tesla's ridiculous valuation, bullish   investors counter that there's no comparison to what Musk is   building with the brand. That's true, but I find the argument to   be dangerous, not because I don't appreciate what the company is   attempting to accomplish, but because analysts and investors   aren't appreciating that the company could fail to accomplish   what it's attempting.A gaudy (and simply ridiculous) valuation is the simple reason   why I won't buy Tesla, and I think other investors may feel the   same way.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Price is what you payThe just-released full-year 2016 earnings showed impressive   year-over-year growth and promised even more in the first-half of   2017. The Model 3 launch in July and subsequent production   ramp-up in the fourth quarter of this year have the potential to   really push growth to the next level.Throw in a simultaneous ramp-up of energy storage products   from Gigafactory 1, and it's easy to see why investors are   excited. But is all of this worth$40 billion of excitement?Tesla is now worth nearly as much asFord Motor CompanyandGeneral Motors-- established automakers that sell more cars in less than one   month than the company did in all of 2016.TSLA Market Capdata byYCharts.Investors could argue that offering the first mass-market   electric vehicle earns Tesla its enormous valuation, but it's not   a very good argument. Ford and General Motors -- and most major   automakers -- are readying electric vehicles for market launches   in the next several years. Many have plans to greatly expand   their offerings of electric vehicles in the next 10 to 15   years.For instance, the Chevy Bolt, which has a starting price of   $37,495 and offers a 238-mile range, promises to give the Model 3   a run for its money. It became available in two states last   December and will increase its footprint this year.Meanwhile, Ford has an""electrification"" strategythat will gradually transition the automaker to hybrid and fully   electric vehicles over the next decade. The Ford Fusion Energi   was the fourth best-selling electric vehicle in the United States   through the first 10 months of last year.In addition to direct competition, electric vehicles sold by   companies other than Tesla will eat away at the company's revenue   stream provided by Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits, which are   sold to comply with regulatory obligations in certain states. In   2016, these accounted for $302 million in revenue. It may not   seem like much, but given the revenue is essentially cost free,   ZEV credit sales accounted for 19% of the company's gross profit   last year.What about non-transportation growth?Investors could argue that, aside from leading the way on   electric vehicles, Tesla's hefty valuation is partially earned   from leading the way in solar power and energy storage. The   annual update letter certainly showed impressive growth last   year.What it didn't show is that the company appears to be   abandoning plans to manufacture Silveo modules, and will instead   purchase ""custom made modules"" from Panasonic, according to an   agreement signed in December 2016. That could result in a   significant writedown of the acquisition costs and technology   development.The update letter also doesn't mention that Tesla's   energy-storage ambitionsaren't realistic from a technical standpoint. In addition to thermodynamic obstacles from specific   lithium-ion chemistries, researchers who have crunched all of the   detailed numbers don't think there will be much -- if any --   battery cost-reduction benefit from building larger battery   factories. That should make investors a little uncomfortable,   especially considering cost reductions were a crucial argument   defending billions of dollars in expenses for building   Gigafactory 1.Why Tesla isn't for meTesla's reliance on storytelling is offputting to me, doubly   so when it results in a $40 billion market cap that is impossible   to really justify. Investors continue to overvalue the potential   of imaginative solar roofs and uneconomical residential energy   storage. However, the real drivers for the company's renewable   energy strategy are more likely to be riding the continued growth   in traditional residential solar and selling energy storage   products into niche markets, such as peak demand stop gaps for   utility companies. Even then, the market opportunity is less --   and the competition more -- than investors properly gauge.Shareholders today may benefit from the Musk Halo Effect --   which attaches a premium valuation to, or boosts, public goodwill   of companies and projects he's involved with -- but that doesn't   mean investors should bank on it lasting indefinitely. It's the   simple reason why I won't be buying Tesla.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Tesla Can Fix Its Flawed Solar Business;3/11/2017;"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) acquisition of SolarCity was touted as a way to   vertically integrate the EV company into a one-stop renewable   energy provider for customers. Walk in a Tesla retail store, and   you can walk out with an electric car run on electricity from   your roof that was stored all day in your Powerwall.The reality of solar in 2017 is that SolarCity's business   model is dying. The lease/power purchase agreement (PPA) that   made SolarCity so popular in the first place is being replaced by   loan and cash sales, which are better served by smaller   installers. Sales are becoming harder as the low-hanging fruit   has already been nabbed by a highly competitive industry. The old   SolarCity isn't what it used to be.What's interesting are the new solar products that SolarCity   started working on, and Tesla is finishing. The solar   manufacturing plant that's supposed to build high-efficiency   solar panels in Buffalo, New York, and the new solar roof   product, which will eventually pair with the Powerwall to create   a holistic energy solution are a path forward for Tesla. But the   installation and sales wings of the solar business have become a   weight Tesla should no longer be willing to hold.makeArticleAd();Tesla's solar roof is a big product coming in 2017. Image     source: Tesla.Tesla should cut thousands of jobsThis sounds dramatic, but don't worry, there's still lots of   work for people to do installing Tesla solar systems. However,   maybe it doesn't make sense for them to do that work under   Tesla's umbrella.When SolarCity built out its solar business, it put most of   its work into building out a sales force that could sell solar   systems and an installation force that could put them up. The   large, national solar model was working and did until the end of   2015. But,according to GTM Research, the top three solar installers in the country grew at just 10%   in 2016 while all other installers grew 53%. Tesla/SolarCity's   decline is even more pronounced with deployments falling from253 MW in Q4 2015to201 MW in Q4 2016.Image source:GTM Research.This isn't necessarily a problem because Tesla would like to   automate the sales process, or move it into Tesla's stores. So,   it makes sense for fewer for Tesla workers to be selling   door-to-door the way SolarCity did.On the installation side, Tesla could offload work to hundreds   of contracting partners the do the actual installation work   rather than having the team in-house. Owning the installation   side of the business means Tesla is taking on the operating costs   of hiring workers and buying installation equipment, and it has   to constantly keep those workers busy. If this work was   contracted out, it would lower risk and potentially lower costs   as contractors compete for business.This wouldn't be a novel approach. Most of the construction   business works on this contractor model, whether it's building a   home or replacing a roof or a kitchen. And with small solar   installers taking market share from Tesla, it would be wise for   it to lower its operating risk.The Powerwall could be the center of a new solar strategy at     Tesla. Image source: Tesla.Create a pre-engineered solution that can     scaleIf Tesla moved to a business model that contracted out work,   it would need to create an easy-to-install solution for   contractors. And that is already on the way with the   development of the Powerwall and the solar panels made in-house.   Soon, Tesla will be more vertically integrated than any other   full service solar company (including energy storage) so the   company could offer a suite of solutions few companies could even   dream of matching.Gigafactory 2, the Buffalo solar plant, will soon be making   solar panels, and Tesla now owns the racking company for solar   systems. These products could be pre-engineered into a solution   that would be sold to smaller contractors. Even the Powerwall   would fit into this model, and Tesla could provide services to be   the brains behind making the Powerwall economically viable.The Solar Roof could be another extension of this model, a   product that could be sold through contractors without having to   train in-house installers on the product.Creating a pre-engineered solution for contractors could   create a highly scalable business for Tesla, which would   potentially lead to a bigger solar footprint overall, which is   Musk's goal, after all.Ditch the solar leaseIf Tesla is serious about turning the solar business into a   cash-flow business, it should eliminate the lease, or power   purchase agreement. This would be turning its back on the   financing model that made SolarCity popular, but the lease is   losing market share rapidly, and it's not a product Tesla wants   to have on its balance sheet anyway.Lease financing has become unattractive over time becauseSolarCity's borrowing costs were rising. Without low borrowing costs the lease has no advantage over a   loan and with loan rates on the decline there no reason to keep   the lease in the portfolio.If Tesla moved to a contractor model for installations, it   could offload the financing of solar systems to third-party   banks, who are already entering the market, and count on cash up   front with each sale. This way, management and investors could   judge the solar business on its margins and cash-flow generation   rather than a questionable metric like retained value.Tesla would be better with a more focused solar     businessIf Elon Musk wants to create a successful solar business long   term, he should de-risk the business by getting out of   installation and high-intensity sales. Instead, focusing the   company on making great products and providing the services   contractors need to sell them would be a move in the right   direction. Investors would likely cheer the move.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The 5 Biggest Challenges to the Driverless Car Revolution;3/11/2017;"The year 2017 is gearing up to be a momentous year for the   driverless car race. But despite major initiatives by   megacorporationsAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , and others, there are major road blocks ahead   for the driverless car revolution. A recentMcKinseyreport highlights five of them.1. PricingNo matter how incredible an innovation might be, it's useless   if it's not affordable. Although Alphabet's Waymo has clocked   more than 2 million road miles in its autonomous vehicles,   McKinsey estimates that self-driving cars are ""unlikely to be   available before 2020."" Alphabet and others are inching closer to   commercializing their products. A partnership withFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE: FCAU) will, for the first time, take Alphabet's autonomous   driving technology out of its peculiar ""panda car"" and into 100   Pacifica Hybrid minivans in early 2017. But those minivans aren't   for sale, and, if they were, would probably cost magnitudes more   than an average minivan.2. Consumer UnderstandingmakeArticleAd();Video source: Waymo viaYouTubeEven if driverless cars become affordable, no one will buy   them if they don't understand them. That means that self-driving   car companies need to educate consumers on the advantages of   autonomous vehicles. Informational videos like the one above   produced by Alphabet's Waymo are an important start, and others   like Tesla Motors are producing their ownvideo vignettesto make self-driving cars salient. Tesla Motors and others have a   clear business incentive to make self-driving seem mainstream,   and the more that their message is spread, the brighter the   future for their sales and sustainability.3. Safety/Security issuesConsumer understanding goes hand in hand with a major concern   about autonomous technology -- safety and security. At no point   was this clearer than in May 2016, when Tesla Motors reported the   first driver fatality while its Autopilot technology was engaged.   The tragic crash occurred when neither the driver nor Tesla   Motors' technology recognized a truck's white-colored trailer   crossing its path on a highway. There will certainly be more   tragedies in the future of autonomous vehicles, and it will   remain a continuing challenge and the highest priority for   self-driving car companies to minimize safety and security   issues. However, it's also important to remember that these   high-profile cases can cause over-reactions, and sticking to   statistics can help investors, companies, and consumers alike   identify the best autonomous option for investing, manufacturing,   and purchasing.4 & 5: Regulation and TechnologyAs with all new innovations, regulation and technology can   make or break a revolution. The McKinsey report is quick to note   that regulation is a hurdle, rather than a never-ending issue. It   makes sense, then, that Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo   Cars have all joined together to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets."" Rather than rally for ""wild west"" free market competition,   these companies want to see a sensible framework of standardized   regulation upon which they can confidently build their new   business units.Technology isn't a hurdle, but there is a minimum threshold   below which driverless cars will never be the norm. Companies   like Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla Motors are aiming for full   autonomy, while others are taking the more step-wise approach of   offering semi-autonomous additions like Audi's ""Traffic Jam   Assist."" The McKinsey report estimates that, once regulation and   technology issues have been resolved, ""up to 15 percent of new   cars sold in 2030 could be fully autonomous.""Hit the brakes?Image Source: Getty Images.2017 will not be the year self-driving cars take over our   roads. Pricing, consumer understanding, safety/security,   regulation, and technology issues will continue to impede this   industry's revolution. But Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others are   making steady gains on addressing these issues, and the ultimate   widespread adoption of autonomous technology is almost   inarguable. Forward-looking investors with long-term horizons   should acknowledge these issues, select their self-driving stocks   accordingly, and sit back to enjoy this multi-year market road   trip.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Beaten-up Driverless Cars Stocks: Are They Bargains?;3/10/2017;"By now you probably know that the driverless car is poised for huge growth in the coming years, hitting an estimated market size of $77 billion by 2035.Companies spanning the technology and automotive sectors are jumping on board to ensure that they don't fall behind dominant players likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) andTesla. Investors looking for driverless cars stocks that both have huge potentialandare bargains should considerBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) ,Ford(NYSE: F) , andDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) .makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.BaiduOver the past few years, Baidu has been working on self-driving vehicle technology and positioning itself to be a leader in the autonomous car space in China. Late last year, the company set up a real-world test of its driverless cars with 200 members of the public. It was one of the first of its kind in China, and was one of the biggest self-driving car moves Baidu made since first testing its autonomous vehicles.The company plans to launch a self-driving shuttle service as early as next year, with the goal of mass producing driverless cars by 2021.Image source:YCharts.Unfortunately for Baidu, the company's stock has remained flat over the past 12 months, with less than 1% gains.. In the company's most recent fourth-quarter 2016 earnings report, revenues fell by 2.6%, mainly due to increasing regulations by the Chinese government on how it conducts online searches.But despite the temporary hit to revenue and margins, Baidu's long-term position as a search powerhouse in China and a leader in driverless car technology remains intact.Baidu has a small fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles and has plans to launch more later this year. The company is partnering with NVIDIA to pair its mapping data with NVIDIA's driverless technologies, which should enhance Baidu's driverless capabilities. Add to that the company's relatively low forward P/E ratio of just 23 (compared to the tech industry average of 26) and Baidu looks like a bargain right now.FordFord is taking a slow-and-steady approach to the driverless car market. The company talks a lot about wanting to make sure its technology is safe for its customers before it releases it out into the wild.But that doesn't mean Ford is lagging behind the competition. The company says it'll have a fleet of about 90 autonomous vehicles -- up from 30 -- by the end of this year, and is on track to begin production of a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021. Ford says the car won't have a steering wheel and will be used for a ride-hailing service.Image Sourge:YCharts.Ford's stock has fallen by more than 7% over the past year, with the recent stock price drop coming in part from the company's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings report. Ford reported in January that its net income fell by $2.7 billion from the year-ago quarter, and revenues were down by $1.6 billion. But the losses came mainly from one-time charges that the company incurred from canceling a factory in Mexico and pension plan costs.One-time charges aside, Ford is still in a strong position to grow in the driverless cars space, and its $1 billion investment in its new driverless car AI company Argo last month indicates that Ford is more resolute than ever.The company's stock currently trades at forward P/E of just 7.28, much cheaper than the automotive industry average of 13, which easily puts it in the bargain bin.Delphi AutomotiveAs one of the world's largest automotive suppliers Delphi has a front-row seat to the driverless car transformation -- and the company is taking huge steps to bring it about. Delphi makes radar, cameras, and software that help power some of the driverless tech on the roads today, and the company says it will debut fully autonomous vehicle technology by 2019, and have it in vehicles by 2021 or 2022.The company showed off some of its autonomous car tech at the Consumer Electronics Show back in January, which included optical cameras and image processors fromMobileye.Image source:YCharts.While Delphi's stock hasn't exactly lost any ground over the past 12 months -- it's up about 6% in fact -- it's still significantly trailing the S&P 500 (see chart above).Revenue for the company's fourth-quarter 2016 was up by 11% year over year and jumped by 10% for the full-year 2016. Delphi's forward P/E of 10.61 is far below the auto parts industry average of 20. The company certainly has an advantage in working with nearly every major automotive manufacturer, and could be a solid long-term play in the driverless car space.Each of the companies above is betting on the driverless car space in a different way, with varying levels of exposure. But each one's current price, forward P/E, and position in the autonomous car market means they're all worth a look from bargain-shopping investors.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Too Good to Pass Up!;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter a stunning 2016,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is looking like a mere mortal. So far in 2017, Nvidia stock is down 7%-plus. The pause in momentum for the benchmarkTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK), as well as theMarket Vectors Semiconductor ETF(NYSEARCA:SMH), has some growth investors concerned. NVDA stock jumped to the stratosphere, but we all know gravity's beckoning call.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBroader factors that are not directly related to Nvidia shares are also weighing on Wall Street. Military analysts consider North Korea's recentmissile launchesas practice for a potential assault on U.S. bases in Japan.Domestically, allegations about Russian involvement in last year's general election continue to dog President Donald Trump. Furthermore, hiswild accusationof being wiretapped by his predecessor have left both the country and the markets jittery.Technically, Nvidia stock is not providing the best of signals. Since early February, NVDA is down an astonishing 18%. And since Feb. 23, Nvidia shares have been firmly below its 50-day moving average. Traders carefully watch this barometer as an indicator of nearer-term strength. What worries vested parties is that NVDA has largely trended bearishly since breaching this key level.With multiple headwinds working against Nvidia stock, should investors risk exposure or cut tail while the going's good? A little trimming wouldn't hurt, but the overall prognosis still looks promising.Nvidia Stock: Slow Start, Fast FinishLet's start with the technical argument. I would be careful in looking too much into recent momentum. Remember that during last year's record-breaking move, the company didn't jump straight from the gate. Nvidia shares rang in 2016 with a near-17% loss up to mid-February. Back then, not only was NVDA below its 50-day, it was dangerously close to falling below the 200-day.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowRather than being a harbinger for Nvidia stock, that level turned out to be the buying opportunity of a lifetime. History doesn't always repeat itself, that I'll easily concede … but I will also argue that viable investment opportunities maintain a certain cadence. Investors can use this data to determine the likelihood of whether their positions will turn out profitable.Click to EnlargeWhat you should keep in mind is that Nvidia shares are marathon runners, not 100-meter sprinters. Between 2000 through the end of 2016, January returns for NVDA stock averaged less than 1%. By the end of the third quarter, however, NVDA is churning out double-digits at 14%.When the year is finally tallied, investors have taken home 55% average profits. As I said earlier, nearer-term momentum isn't always a reliable barometer.What is a reliable indicator is the first-quarter performance. Only one time did Nvidia stock turn negative at the 90-day mark, and still managed to squeeze out a profit in the full year. So if NVDA stock is in red ink on March 31, then yes, it's time to think about exposure.But if it ends up in the black, I like my chances. Only twice did NVDA do well in the first quarter, and go sour later in the year.The Fundamental Case for NvidiaFundamentally as well, I don't see how you can go wrong with Nvidia stock. The company is integrated with the most exciting developments in digital technologies - automated driving, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. As innovators likeTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, NVDA will be right there.Furthermore, it's unlikely that the company will lose its dominance in its field of specialty. As a result, Nvidia is in good hands. AsBlue Chip Growtheditor Louis Navellierstates:""The company has been in the computer graphics business for more than two decades - it invented the GPU in 1999 - so it is a well-established player. To date, Nvidia owns 7,300 patents relating to computer graphics, the largest portfolio of its kind.""Furthermore, NVDA isn't just innovating, it's finding tremendous success. InvestorPlace contributor Ryan Fuhrmannwritesthat during the fourth quarter, ""Nvidia reported that data center revenue tripled and that AI is being rapidly adopted throughout the world. Total revenue jumped 55% to $2 billion."" Sure, the recent technical slowdown is newsworthy, but come on! You have to look at the bigger picture.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Breaking Down on Model 3 WorriesAll in all, Nvidia stock is a buying opportunity. I totally get the concerns about acquiring NVDA at a lofty price point. However, I don't consider it to be a ""trap valuation."" The company witnessed incredible success and they have a proven track record. Any weakness is a natural correction toward the next leg up.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to Buy8 Energy Stocks in Peril as Crude Oil Breaks DownThe postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Too Good to Pass Up!appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why You Should Bet on Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Stock;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) have tracked higher year-to-date alongside the broader stock market. While CRM stock remains constructively positioned through the intermediate to longer-term lens, in the near-term, it has reached better technical resistance that must be respected until cleared.makeArticleAd();Traders and active investors alike may be bullish, but they also would be wise to exercise patience.When I last discussed shares of Salesforce.com on Oct. 7, 2016, I pointed to the near-term weakness in the stock at the time lining up with multiyear technical support. I said the bullish reversal from Oct. 5-6 pointed toward a next upside target at $76, followed by $80.Over the ensuing weeks, both upside targets were reach, and the trade had run its course.CRM Stock ChartsLooking at the weekly chart below, CRM stock - viewed through a multiyear lens - very much qualifies as a ""trend following"" stock. In other words, it's a stock that over the years has trended higher in a very orderly and well-defined channel.Click to EnlargeI often repeat to my direct members and clients: Trend following can be one of the most rewarding trading and investing strategies if one learns to focus on those stocks or assets that offer the most well defined trends. The choppier a trend is, the more challenging investors find it to stick with the trend over time.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuySalesforce stock over the years has offered traders and investors a notably well-defined trend that allowed for reduction of risk at the top end of the trading range, and addition of risk near the lower end of the trend.As such, the lows in CRM stock from the fourth quarter of 2016 coincided with the lower end of the multiyear uptrending channel, which I marked with the two parallels. So far in 2017, Salesforce has strung together an almost creepy orderly rally with just about no volatility.This orderly push higher through a multiyear lens, and from a trend following perspective, ultimately should have higher to go still - namely toward the upper end of the multi-year channel.However, note that CRM shares, for the time being, have reached critical horizontal resistance in the low $80s, which matches up with the 2015 and 2016 highs.Will Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Sell Out to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)?On the daily chart, we see that the lows in CRM stock from Q4 2016 in the high $60s formed an important higher low versus the early 2016 lows. Those lows also matched up with a nearly exact 50% retracement of the entire rally from the February 2016 lows in to the May 2016 highs.Click to EnlargeThis paints a constructive backdrop. However, I believe the year-to-date rally right now, to stand a better chance of sustainably overcoming horizontal resistance in the low $80s, might need a bit more consolidation.My specific target?

Breaking Down Tesla's Inventory Increase;3/9/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) reported fourth-quarter earnings last month, and   one notable line item on the balance sheet was a sequential   increase in the carrying value of its inventory. At the end of   2016, the electric-car maker had nearly $2.1 billion in   inventory, a sequential increase from $1.6 billion in the prior   quarter.The breakdown of inventory isn't disclosed until the   subsequent 10-Q or 10-K is filed after earnings, and Tesla filed   its 10-K earlier this month. Investors can now see the moving   parts.Tesla is now sitting on $1 billion in finished goodsFor starters, here's a breakdown of Tesla's inventory for the   past two quarters.makeArticleAd();InventoryQ3 2016Q4 2016Raw materials$353.8 million$680.3 millionWork in process$330 million$233.7 millionFinished goods$791.6 million$1.02 billionService parts$129.3 million$136.6 millionTotal$1.6 billion$2.1 billionData source: SEC filings.It's worth pointing out real quick that the SolarCity   acquisition closed during the quarter, combining both companies'   balance sheets. SolarCity had about $172.7 million worth of total   inventory (consisting primarily of $141 million in raw materials   and $31.8 million in work in progress) at the end of the year,   which accounts for a portion of the sequential increase.Image source: Tesla.Since SolarCity does not have a finished goods category for   its inventory, we can safely say that the notable increase of   about $225 million in finished goods is coming from the   automotive side. This is the first time that Tesla's finished   goods inventory has surpassed $1 billion.Cars on boatsThis figure includes ""vehicles in transit to fulfill customer   orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale at our retail   and service center locations, pre-owned Tesla vehicles, and   energy storage products."" Tesla keeps minimal inventory on hand   relative to traditional car dealers, and cell production for   storage products didn't begin until after the quarter closed.Tesla in Amsterdam. Image source: Tesla.Investors do know that Tesla has been growing its   international sales -- total revenue outside the United States   grew 34% to $2.8 billion in 2016 -- and those orders take longer   to get to their new homes abroad. Reflecting this, vehicles in   transit at the end of each quarter rose throughout 2016.QuarterVehicles in Transit at Quarter EndQ1 20162,615Q2 20165,150Q3 20165,500Q4 20166,450Data source: Tesla.Part of the increase for the fourth quarter was the nearly   1,000 additional vehicles that were probably sitting on a boat in   the middle of the ocean, relative to the third quarter. Tesla   doesn't disclose average transaction prices, but most third-party   estimates peg the average at right around $100,000, which would   suggest that approximately $100 million of the increase can be   tied to the increase in in-transit vehicles.The rest of the increase can probably be explained by a modest   increase in stores and service locations (14 new locations opened   during the quarter) and associated inventory models and loaners,   as well as higher inventories of pre-owned vehicles (pre-owned   vehicle sales are driving the growth in service and other   revenue). Considering Tesla's integrated model and growth, a   ballooning inventory balance is just par for the course.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Stocks Mostly Flat as Trump Rattles Wall Street;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities bounced around the unchanged line on Thursday as investors were loath to make any big moves ahead of Friday's pivotal non-farm payrolls report.makeArticleAd();This will be the last read on the jobs market ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting where officials are expected to raise interest rates again for the second time in three months; a serious acceleration of the prior pace of just two rate hikes in the past 10 years.In the end, theDow Jones Industrial Averagegained a fraction, theS&P 500added 0.1%, theNasdaq Compositewafted up a fraction and theRussell 2000fell by 0.4%.Treasury bonds were weaker (continuing the worst selloff in more than 40 years), the dollar was mixed, gold declined for the eighth straight session and crude oil continued Wednesday's nasty slide down another 2%. That boosted theProShares UltraShort Crude Oil(NYSEARCA:SCO) recommended toEdgesubscribers to a gain of 12.4% as West Texas Intermediate fell below the $50-a-barrel level for the first time since December following bearish inventory data, increasing U.S. rig activity and a lack of compliance by non-OPEC nations with last year's production freeze agreement.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyDespite this, energy and healthcare led the way with gains of 0.6%. Yield-sensitive REITs were the laggards down 1.3%.Marathon Oil Corporation(NYSE:MRO) gained 8.1% after announcing the sale of its Canadian oil-sands business to Shell and Canadian Natural Resources for $2.5 billion in cash alongside a $1.1 billion acquisition in the Permian Basin.Sears Holding Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) - fending off bankruptcy fears - gained 6.9% after reporting a narrower-than-expected Q4 loss thanks to inventory and cost management efforts.On the downside,Staples, Inc.(NASDAQ:SPLS) fell 5.3% after reporting weak earnings and revenues 9% below estimates.Beneath the surface, however, there was some excitement as sellers descended on the financials after the White House press secretary confirmed that President Trump - as he hinted on the campaign trail - strongly supports the restoration of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act that was removed in the 1990s. It forced the separation of riskier investment banking activities from deposit-taking commercial banking activities.While this is widely seen as a good thing for the health of the financial system and the sanctity of savings accounts, it's bad news for the profits hounds on Wall Street. In other political news, the Republican healthcare reform bill is moving through the legislative process clearing committee level votes.Looking ahead to the employment situation report tomorrow, analysts are looking for a payroll gain of 200,000 on a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7%.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Breaking Down on Model 3 WorriesKeep an eye on wage inflation, with pay raises eagerly anticipated as small business survey data shows a continued tightening of the labor market and increasingly scarcity of qualified workers - something that will pour gasoline on the fires of inflation throughout the economy.Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of theEdge(ETFs) andEdge Pro(Options) investment advisory newsletters.

Bullish on NVIDIA? You'll Love These Stocks;3/9/2017;"Investors kind of have crush onNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) . The company has posted quarter after quarter of   strong sales, grown gaming GPU market share, introduced new   driverless car technologies, and expanded its artificial   intelligence (AI) opportunities -- all of which have led   investors to swoon to the stock, pushing it up over 200% over the   past 12 months.If you're bullish on NVIDIA's prospects in gaming, AI, and   driverless cars, then perhaps you should giveAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andSony(NYSE: SNE) a good look as well. These companies aren't making   the exact same moves as NVIDIA, but each is poised to dominate   one of these segments in their own way.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();An alternative artificial intelligence playNVIDIA is alreadytaking big stepsto make AI a priority through its investments in deep learning   technologies like Drive PX 2 (for cars) and servers   (DGX-1). But it's not the only one who will benefit from the   tech sector's focus on AI. Just look at the size of the   artificial intelligence market over the next few years (hint:   there's plenty of room for lots of winners).Data source:TracticaandStatista.And this is where Amazon comes in. The company has a dedicated   AI team that's already up to the ""thousands,"" according to   Amazon, and an AI focus that hits both the consumer and   enterprise markets.Amazon's Echo may seem like just another consumer product, but   powering the unit is the company's Alexa virtual assistant. Alexa   can answer basic questions, set alarms, check the weather, play   music, and order items from Amazon (of course!). However, Alexa   has also been opened to developers so that other companies can   integrate the AI into their own devices and services, and it has   even started a fund to supply capital to companies that are doing   so.Amazon won't get rich off of selling Alexa-powered devices,   but the assistant is giving the company a leg up in the home   automation space. Amazon is using its AI virtual assistant   to grow its own ecosystem, and it's clear from new rumors ofupcoming Alexa-powered devicesand continual integration of Alexa into other products that the   company will continue to use this AI to tie consumers to its   business.The real AI play for Amazon will be through its web hosting   services, AWS.  The company released several new AI services   to developers at its re:Invent conference a few months ago,   including an image-recognition platform and a text-to-speech   service. And, most importantly, the company released a program   that allows developers to create AI chatbots capable of   multilevel conversations, similar to Alexa.These are all important because as Amazon releases these tools   into the wild, it expects to be paid back through developers   using those AI systems by hosting them through AWS.Amazon brought in $3.53 billion with AWS in Q4 2016 -- an   increase of 47% year over year -- and with more complex AI   systems being built now and into the future, the company will   benefit from all of those AI systems needing a robust cloud   hosting service.Don't expect Amazon's AI strategies to be an immediate payoff,   but the company is taking big steps now with Alexa and its AI   tools for developers to build a strong artificial intelligence   foundation for the future.An alternative driverless car playNVIDIA bulls know that driverless cars will likely play a big   role in the company's future, and part of that opportunity stems   from the company's recent partnership with electric car maker   Tesla. The automaker's self-driving technologies are powered   by NVIDIA's Drive PX 2 supercomputer, along with Tesla's own   ""neural net for vision, sonar, and radar processing.""Tesla's driverless car play is a bit more hands-on than   NVIDIA's, but it's no less important. CEO Elon Musk has said   that his company will bring a fully autonomous vehicle to market   by 2018, and he has also mentioned that Tesla owners will be able   torent out their autonomous vehiclesin the near future, when they're not using them.That's more than just lip service, of course. Tesla already   manufactures its latest models with fully autonomous hardware   built into every new vehicle, and it's slowly releasing new   software updates as it gathers more driving data. All of this   hardware -- and the release of new software -- means Tesla is   already a few steps ahead of the driverless car competition.An alternative gaming and VR playOf course, gaming is one of NVIDIA's biggest opportunities.   The company already brings in 62% of its total revenue from its   gaming segment, and the growing virtual reality market could help   NVIDIA continue its gaming success. By 2020, the VR market will   be worth an estimated $70 billion.Investors looking for an alternative VR play should consider   Sony's recent lead in the space. The company released its first   VR headset just four months ago, and it recently reported that it   has already sold 915,000 units. For comparison's sake, the   Oculus Rift has sold an estimated 243,000 units, and the HTC   Vive has sold 420,000, according to Superdata Research.That's notable because Sony's PlayStation VR headset sales are   one of the first huge hardware successes for VR, and they are on   track to surpass the company's own estimate of selling 1 million   headset in the first six months.Still, hardware VR sales will eventually be eclipsed by VR   software sales, and that's why Sony truly has a great opportunity   in virtual reality. The company is already working with 230   developers and content creators to build VR games and content for   its gaming console, and it already has more than 70 VR games.Sony has identified virtual reality as one of the keys tobuilding out its important Game and Network   Services division, and the initial numbers from its VR headset sales are a good   indicator that the company is moving quickly in that   direction.Of course, there's no guarantee the stocks listed above will   have the same success NVIDIA's had recently. Nor are Amazon,   Tesla, or Sony making the exact same moves that NVIDIA is. But if   you're looking to tap into AI, driverless cars, and virtual   reality, then you should certainly consider how each one of these   companies is poised to dominate their respective markets.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Is Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) Stock Dropping After a Great Q4?;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptimism was high as trading closed March 9 and investors waited for the fourth-quarter earnings report fromUlta Beauty Inc(NASDAQ:ULTA) - especially aftere.l.f. Beauty Inc(NYSE:ELF), another cosmetics company, rose 12% after reporting earnings the day before.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrBut ULTA stock didn't enjoy the same hurrah.Ulta - which changed its name from Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance in January when itadopted a new holding company structure- was looking for revenue of $1.52 billion to $1.54 billion for the January quarter, and earnings per share of from $2.08 per share to $2.13. The ""whisper number"" on earnings was even higher,at $1.57 per share. The revenue would represent sales growth for the beauty chain of 12% to 14%, outstanding for a retailer.The stock chart has been attractive, too, showing higher highs and higher lows for some time.Everything seemed set up for success, and continued bullishness for ULTA stock.Ulta by the NumbersWhile impressive on their face, traders treated the numbers as a miss, taking down the stock more than 4% in after-hours trading, after trading it down slightly during the day.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Breaking Down on Model 3 WorriesUlta said it had earnings of $140.018 million, $2.25 per share, on revenue of $1.58 billion. Sales were up 24.6% year-over-year, and up 16.6% at stores open over a year.The online side of the business grew an impressive 63.4%, but still represented just $154.9 million, a tiny fraction of the whole.Net income was up 30% year-over-year.Is ULTA Stock an Aging Play?While makeup is often sold by attractive, young models, it's used by aging oldsters, of both sexes. Anyone who has ever appeared on TV, including me, has had to wear makeup, more every year, and new HD cameras make that even more necessary.Ulta was founded by veterans from Chicago'sOscoDrugchain, and is based in the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook. It came public in 2007 at about $30 per share, and while it has paid only one dividend, in 2012, its value has increased over eight-fold to its recent level of about $274.Ulta has really taken off since Mary Dillon, a former cellular chain with experience atMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD) andPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP), became CEO in 2013. Revenues have doubled, to nearly $4 billion per year, and margins have held level, with about 8% of revenue hitting the net income line.While other retailers have faded, Ulta has built out a network of almost 1,000 stores, most of them 10,000 square feet in size, almost as big as aStaples Inc.(NASDAQ:SPLS) office supply store. It's both a sales and service business, with 20,000 products from 500 brands, as well as full-size salons serving hair, skin and eyebrow needs. (Yes, they have an Eyebrow Bar.)Ulta represents a classic roll-up of what had been a very diffused industry. Think of it as a Staples for the face, a beauty superstore.Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock. Here's Why.And a great way to hide the wages of age from your boss or the camera.Why the Bearish Reaction?The reason might be first-quarter guidance, which came in a range of $1.24 billion to $1.27 billion - just shy of expectations for $1.28 billion. But that's a hair of a miss, and something that excellent operational results - and a $25 million share repurchase program announcement - should've overcome.Instead, the reason might be found in a trader's bearish call from Monday, indicating that while Ulta is an impressive growth story,fair value could be as much as 40% below the current price. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 45, and a market cap of over $17 billion - more than 3 times sales - traders were looking to take profits.Investors might look upon that as a buying opportunity in ULTA stock when trading opens Friday.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Breaking Down on Model 3 Worries;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of electric vehicle/solar roof/home batter backup makerTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) are dropping below their 50-day moving average for the first time since early December. That's worth a loss of nearly 15% since TSLA stock peaked in the middle of February.makeArticleAd();The catalyst? Sentiment has soured on concerns aboutvery lofty market expectations for the launch of the Model 3 sedanlater this year.The Bears Are Circling TSLA StockThe selling intensified in late February after Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino cut TSLA stock to ""Sell"" and lowered his price target to $185 - which would be worth another 25% drop from current levels.While acknowledging the company's leadership role relative to more established automakers in terms of electric vehicle technology, EV adoption with customers and battery manufacturing, his concerns focused on near-term operational execution of the Model 3 launch, the unproven solar business and the rapid free cash burn rate (which is expected to necessitate a capital rate before the fourth quarter of the year).The capital expenditure needs to get the Model 3 produced - and ramp production of the existing Model S and Model X as expected - is large totaling $3 billion in Tamberrino's estimate.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017In his note on TSLA stock, he also identifies and charts the ""Tesla hype cycle,"" shown below, as showing how shares have been rangebound between $180 and $280 over the last few years, with the ups and downs associated with hype surrounding new products followed by lamentation on delays, lowered delivery targets and capital raises.The delivery expectations on Wall Street are simply untenable. The company delivered 22,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 76,230 for 2016, missing expectations. Yet the Street expects Tesla, somehow, to deliver 1,000,000 vehicles per year by 2020 despite a still burgeoning EV charging network, reports ofhedge funds stockpiling battery materialsand the fact TSLA hasn't even completed a beta prototype of the Model 3.The company will next report results on May 3 after the bell.

Residential Solar Revolution: Why National Installers Aren't Evolving Fast Enough;3/9/2017;"Just over two years ago, nearly three-quarters of residential   solar companies used third-party financing in the form of leases   or power purchase agreements to finance their solar systems. Now,   according toGTM Research, that number fell to just 47% last quarter and the decline shows   no sign of slowing down.This has caused an upheaval for installers built on the   leasing model, whether they'll admit it or not. SolarCity was in   trouble untilTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought it out, andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) haven't been able to turn their leasing businesses   into sustainably profitable businesses, either. With the   financing trends changing, these companies need to find a new   direction forward.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Changing gears in residential solarI don't think the transition from selling solar systems with   leases to selling them with loans can be done over time because   the companies I mentioned have too much financial incentive to   sell leases rather than loans. Tesla is trying to make the   transition, but its installations are declining, and it was still   only 28% sales and 72% leases last quarter.Instead, national installers need to rip off the Band-Aid:   Ditch the lease and replace it with a loan product that will be   easy for customers to understand. This will bring in cash   immediately and reduce confusion for customers.Another step they can take to transition their businesses and   generate cash is selling the portfolio of leased assets they have   sitting on the balance sheet. There are a number of yieldcos that   would love to own those residential solar assets at the right   price. And even if the price isn't perfect, installers should   want to sell their financing assets to focus on lowering   installation costs.The third transition all solar companies need to make is think   about differentiation. Financing was a differentiator a few years   ago, but if cash or loan sales are the dominant financing model,   what separates Vivint from Sunrun, or anyone else at this   point?Tesla is making the case that it's different with an upcoming   solar panel, the Powerwall, and the solar roof that's supposed to   launch this summer. If these products are successful, they will   create a path to the future.Sunrun and Vivint Solar have tested some new products like   energy storage, but they need to double down on the next   generation. Vivint may be well served integrating more fully with   its sister company's security solutions. Sunrun would be wise to   partner with a high-efficiency solar panel manufacturer and an   energy storage company to differentiate itself.Financial results are starting to dragWith the market moving away from the national installer model,   financials are starting to look worse for these installers. Tesla   said it installed just 803 MW of solar in 2016, down from an   original guidance of 1.25 GW. Vivint Solar's third quarter (the   most recent reported) saw installations fall from 61 MW a year   ago to 59 MW as it focused on leases. And while Sunrun is growing   more than the other two and has added cash and loan products, it   has the highest costs of the three, which should lead to lower   margins overall. It also has a clear incentive to push customers   toward the more profitable lease.Industry data shows that the solar lease is dying, and solar   installers need to adapt. I think that will require a paradigm   shift in how they think about their business, or they'll get run   over by competitors who adapt more quickly.10 stocks we like better than SunrunWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Unveils Major Solar Project on Kauai Island, Hawaii;3/9/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAlaunched a solar project in Hawaii, in association with Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (""KIUC""). Tesla will provide Hawaiian island of Kauai with solar power, using its panels and giant battery packs at the farm.makeArticleAd();The solar farm comprises 54,978 solar panels, which have 13 megawatts of solar generation capacity as well as 272 52-megawatt-hour Tesla Powerpack lithium-ion battery storage systems. Tesla has installed these batteries in order to store the solar energy which can be used during night.Under the terms of the collaboration, KIUC will purchase power for a period of 20 years at the rate of 13.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cost is lower than that incurred to purchase power from diesel plants as well as below the charge paid by consumers for electricity in the state.Recently, KIUC has also signed a contract with a subsidiary of Virginia-based AES Corp. Under the deal, the entities will develop a solar-plus-battery storage project on the island's South Shore. It will include a 28-megawatt solar farm and a 20-megawatt five-hour duration energy storage system. This will be the biggest battery system globally.The solar project in Hawaii demonstrates Tesla's effort to transform into a one-stop-shop for clean energy consumers.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Jekyll-and-Hyde Trade Right Now;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) are higher by a solid 20% year-to-date, and AAPL stock is up 40% over the past 12 months. Making ""bets"" on a stock based on its recent percentage moves doesn't make much sense, though, in a raging risk-on environment such as we've seen since last November.makeArticleAd();Over my career, I have found that applying a multi-time-frame approach to stock trading and investing not only allows for better perspective, but as a result, also results in superior risk management - and dare I say ""timing"" of trade entries and exits.I make it a point in this column to often remind ye faithful that stocks are a highly correlated asset class, particularly compared to other asset classes such as commodities. While the price of pork bellies has little correlation with the price of gold, within the stock market, around 80% of stocks tend to rise and fall together at any given time. I point this out because while the year-to-date rally in AAPL stock is impressive and worth respecting until it reverses, there also has been a broader stock market risk-on trade thus far in 2017.More than anything, I highlight this for perspective.When I last discussed Apple stock onFeb. 2following the latest earnings report, I said that shares were reaching a critical technical area of resistance through a multimonth lens. While AAPL has since marginally pushed above this technical area, the tale of two time frames remains.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowToday, I would like to reiterate and update this analysis.AAPL Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that Apple over the years has greatly respected its 200-week simple moving average (red), which was a source of technical support in 2013 and again just last year.Click to EnlargeAt the same time, we also see that each time AAPL stock gets overly extended above this moving average, it tends to fall into a consolidation phase. Currently, the stock trades roughly 30% above this moving average; at past extremes, Apple traded as much as 50% above it.From this perspective, AAPL stock could have further to run on the upside.On the other hand, the MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart has now reached levels that in the past led to some downside pressure.Lastly - and I believe most importantly - the rate of change (i.e., the near-vertical rally over the past couple months) has pushed AAPL stock back above its 2015 highs. While this in and of itself is a positive development, previous important highs rarely if ever are overcome on a sustainable basis until and unless some consolidation near those previous highs has taken place.Apple stock has yet to consolidate. Thus, it likely will find the current upside momentum unsustainable over the next few weeks or even months.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?On the daily chart, we see that AAPL gapped higher again following its Jan. 31 earnings report, and despite already being overbought by plenty of measures, kept pushing higher as the broader stock market animal spirits brought in fresh momentum.Click to EnlargeNote that except for a couple days in early January, AAPL stock has now held above its 8-day simple moving average (blue) since early December 2016. That is alongstretch to be trading above such a near-term moving average. I feel it increasingly begs for some consolidation lower.At the same time, until this moving average is broken on the downside, one must continue to respect the uptrend.Through this near-term lens, if AAPL can close above $140, a next squeeze higher into $143 - $144 looks plausible. Alternatively, a break and hold below $138.50 could set in motion a better consolidation move lower with first downside targets near $136 and $132.Like what you see?

Is Realty Income Corp (O) the Best REIT Right Now?;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRealty Income Corp(NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It is one of the leading REITs in the retail sector and is one of the most consistent total-return REITs in the business.makeArticleAd();The question is whether retail REITs are the best place to be right now. With the growth of online shopping and the challenges many big box retailers are experiencing, buying a stock in a firm that owns the property and buildings in the sector where a massive long-term disruption is taking place may not be the best choice.But that isn't O.O specializes in stand-alone retail spaces. For example, its biggest tenant isWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NYSE:WBA). Its second largest client isFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX). Other major tenants includeCVS Health Corp(NYSE:CVS),Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) andDollar General Inc(NYSE:DG), to name a few.O's biggest competitor isSimon Property Group Inc(NYSE:SPG), which is almost 4x the size of O by market cap.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017The biggest difference between the two is that SPG focuses on shopping malls, where O focuses on stand-alone businesses.That means O is in much better shape with its tenants than SPG is. Realty Income Corp has tenants that are not as challenged by online competition. And, since its tenants don't rely on other tenants on the property, it's much clearer the kind of revenue stream they need to make it profitable.SPG is at the whim of consumers and tenants alike. For example, it's not unusual for smaller malls to have both aSears Holding Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) and aJ C Penney Company Inc(NYSE:JCP) anchoring the rest of the mall. If the Sears leaves, you have a problem. If the JC Penney leaves as well, you have a disaster.This is the biggest challenge today. The mall concept is losing steam. The stores that are locked into leases for space in these malls will either walk away, close up shop or request a rent adjustment given the new circumstances.Whatever option you choose, it is bad news for SPG.But O is freed from all that bother. Its tenants are growing, not contracting. They operate their own businesses and their models have been proven from small towns to big cities.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Continues to Ignore the Elephant in the RoomThis is the significant difference between it and others in the retail space.Its dividend is a solid 4.3% and O stock is focused on maintaining it and raising it. The stock has been treading water for the past 12 months, but its numbers continue to impress. Some analysts are concerned that its valuation is too high, but given the fact that it operates one of the best REIT portfolios out there, it should be higher than say, SPG and others.Now is a great time to pick this REIT up at a good price.Richard Band'sProfitable Investingadvisory service helps retirement savers outperform the market without losing a minute of sleep along the way.

Why It's So Important for Tesla to Shift to Solar Sales as Quickly as Possible;3/8/2017;"One of the most prominent criticisms of SolarCity prior to   being acquired byTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) was that the solar installer had a cash flow   problem.This situation was created by the fact that SolarCity rose to   become the No. 1 installer largely through its leasing model,   which offered customers solar power at little to no upfront cost.   But that required the company to invest its own money upfront   into systems that it would subsequently monetize through lease   payments and power purchase agreements (PPAs) over the course of   decades.By its own admission, SolarCity focused too heavily on growing   its MW deployments, which is why it reduced its deployment   guidance several times in 2016 in order to better manage cash   flow. Additionally, it was on SolarCity, as the owner of the   systems, to monetize the Solar Investment Tax Credit (worth 30%   of the value of the system), which it did (and still does)   through a convoluted system of tax equity financing. It also   createscomplicationsif the house is foreclosed on.makeArticleAd();Tesla Powerwall 2. Image source: Tesla.In contrast, a cash sale pulls forward the revenue recognition   and the cash flow with it, while leaving it to the customer to   realize the value from the tax credit. It's a much simpler model   in almost every way, although the sales process is more involved.   That's why it's so important for Tesla to shift to solar sales   instead of leases as quickly as possible. Fortunately, Tesla is   making progress.The proportion of sales is risingIn Tesla's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, the company   notes ongoing progress with the shift toward cash sales.MetricQ4 2015Q3 2016Q4 2016Percentage of solar capacity deployed that are           sales4%13%28%Data source: SEC filings.Tesla deployed 201 MW of solar energy generation and 98 MWh of   energy storage during the quarter, and the company makes it   abundantly clear that ""cash preservation"" is far more important   than MW deployment growth at this stage. Just today, Tesla   announced that it had completed a large deployment in Hawaii for   a 13 MW generation system combined with 52 MWh of storage,   consisting of nearly 55,000 panels and over 270 Powerpacks.Video source: Tesla.Give it timeCEO Elon Musk reiterated on the subsequent earnings call that   the energy storage market is set to take off and will likely grow   at a faster rate -- perhaps twice the rate, by Musk's estimation   -- than the automotive business. The energy business posted a   sharp uptick in sales, jumping sequentially from $23.3 million in   the third quarter to $131.4 million in the fourth quarter, but   this was driven by the SolarCity deal closing with about six   weeks left in the quarter.Margins in the energy business were held back by ongoing   investments in production capacity, but Tesla says it expects   long-term gross margin to be comparable to the automotive   business, which is to say a long-term target of 25% to 30%   (automotive gross margin was 22% last quarter).It might take a while to revamp the sales and distribution   model, but continuing to emphasize sales instead of leases, as   well as cash flow, is absolutely the right call.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) Stock Without Fear;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe biotech and healthcare sectors were the political punching bags of the 2016 U.S. elections. And now, President Trump's rhetoric of lower drug prices continues the turmoil in pharmaceutical stocks. As a result, theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) has had a violent year.makeArticleAd();Source:A 4 via FlickrUp until yesterday, the sector was in a recovery. Then renewed promises of new systems for lower drug prices caused another tizzy. Stocks likeBristol-Myers Squibb Co(NYSE:BMY) suffered with the herd. Today's price action, however, is encouraging, as investors bid BMY higher.Late January, I shared how togo long BMY on a panic dip. The trade was an easy success. Today I plan on repeating performance with a similar concept.The fundamentals have not changed, so I won't spend time re-dissecting them. There may be concessions to be made, but considering the size and influence of the biotech sector, I bet that they will be much milder than the built-in fears of Wall Street.How to Trade BMY StockThe Bet:Sell the BMY Jan 2018 $43 puts and collect $1.30 per contract to open. The 23% buffer from current price allows for a 90% theoretical chance of success. I need BMY stock to stay above my sold put, though. If not, I will be need to buy BMY shares. So I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock. Anything below $42 would accrue losses for me. For those who don't want to risk being put BMY stock I can change the trade to be a credit put spread instead.3 Biotech Stocks That Could Double OvernightThe Alternate:Sell a BMY Jan 2018 $43/$40 credit put spread for $1.01. Unlike the naked put sold, the credit spread has a finite risk profile. The price buffer is the same, so this has a 90% chance for yielding 33% on money risked. I need Bristol-Myers to stay above my sold spread while the trade is open.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close them for partial gains or losses at any time.

Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) With Help;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith one mostly successful launch byAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) under its belt, AMD stock looks to be at a nice launching point of its own. And for bullish investors believing in second chances both off and on the price chart, a modified options spread is looking like a smart choice.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrLet me explain.Depending on one's tech-savvy or who you turn to who can break down the bits and bytes, Advanced Micro's debut of Ryzen, its new CPU for PCs and servers, may have you on the fence. Since its release last week some are saying AMD isback in the game, with the right blend of disruptive architecture and price. Many techies, though, are giving Ryzenmixed reviews.The consensus appears to agree that if you're looking for Ryzen to take your breath away for its desktop gaming capabilities - keep looking, or at least give AMD time to improve the functionality. But if it's workstation performance you're craving right here and right now, Ryzen delivers.In other circles of (some) importance, foreign-based investorMubadala Developmenthas taken an age-old cue from Wall Street and sold into the news. From a SEC filing, it was learned the firm, a long-term holder of the company, unloaded about $615 million of AMD stock. That's roughly one-third of its position.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Maybe more important is the still massive 97 million share stake owned by Mubadala. In speaking with Reuters the firm stated, more or less, that it was simplytime to ring the registeron part of their holdings. And as with someuniform but overall modestinsider selling of AMD stock by key personnel, I personally can't fault those parties for taking profits.AMD Stock Daily ChartPullbacks or corrective moves are not very much fun when you're already long a stock. But the double-digit decline experienced over the past week in AMD is common enough in growth stocks that it's not worth getting overly alarmed over.Furthermore, when the price action shapes up as a constructive-looking bottom, the situation offers investors an attractive entry point with risk-to-reward skewed in their favor.Specifically, AMD stock has established a high-level double-bottom pattern off the prior highs set back in December. The price formation was confirmed Tuesday with a modest signal through the high of the prior session's doji candlestick.As well, with the 50-day simple moving average also offering support just below Monday's pivot low of $12.38 and AMD shares signaling an oversold stochastics condition - investors have a fairly nice technical point of entry and a couple options for exiting if the corrective bottom fails.AMD Stock Modified CollarBeing optimistic that a bottom is in and with earnings out of the way, as well as one of AMD's big product catalysts, I like a modified collar in AMD stock as a way to position long. In this spread, the trader buys shares, sells an out-of-the-money call and purchases partial protection using a bear put vertical.With the modified collar, risk isn't fully closed off. The vertical only offers intrinsic protective value equal to the width and placement of the strikes used. Further, the hedge value is typically less effective when the expiration is far off and/or using a narrow spread.The benefit of using the vertical is the reduced cost compared to an outright long put for protection. But given its limitations, this variation is more attractive when company-specific news isn't on the calendar.Having said that and with AMD stock at $13.23, selling the April $16 call and buying the April $12/$10 put spread in conjunction with purchasing shares is priced for $13.33, or 10 cents more than the cost of the standalone stock position.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Continues to Ignore the Elephant in the RoomOutside the discussed limitations, on an expiration basis this contains risk to $1.33, at which time the $12 put offers protection for the AMD stock component. Of course, there would be additional losses below $10. However, that's nearly 25% below current prices and given what's been discussed, this strategist sees the positioning as an acceptable trade-off.The real cost to this AMD position is thought to be the sold $16 call used to finance the protective value of the vertical. At the end of the day and prior to any adjustments, the sale does cap the trader's upside potential. Bottom line though, given that's nearly 21% higher, we're personally very receptive to that type of less-pressing challenge.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

How Tesla Created an Opportunity for Bentley Motors to go Electric;3/8/2017;"British hyper-luxury brand Bentley Motors brought a surprise   to the Geneva Motor Show this week: an electric car.For now, the Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept, as it's called,   is strictly for show. But it's a show car with a mission: To help   Bentley decide if it's time to grab an opportunity it sees for an   electric luxury car positioned above the products fromTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .The Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept could point the way to     the British super-luxury brand's first battery-electric     vehicle. Image source: Bentley Motors.makeArticleAd();What it is: A Bentley, only electricThe EXP 12 Speed 6e is a high-performance convertible with the   craftsmanship and interior details that are typical of Bentley   (that is to say, exquisite). It has the usual high-tech touches,   but done Bentley's way: The interior is swathed in   fine leather, wood, and hand-cut glass.Leather, wood, glass, and over-the-top details? The EXP 12     Speed 6e is definitely a Bentley. Image source: Bentley     Motors.Bentley said that a production version would have rapid   inductive charging and ""a range sufficient for grand touring   requirements."" But didn't give details of the car's powertrain or   specifics on its battery or range, because this isn't intended to   be a production car.Instead, as Bentley CEO Wolfgang Durheimer explained, this   Bentley is intended to be a starting point for conversations with   potential customers:The EXP 12 Speed 6e is a concept to show that Bentley is     defining electric motoring in the luxury sector, with the     appropriate technology, high quality materials and refinement     levels you'd expect from a true Bentley. This concept enables     us to engage with luxury customers and gather feedback on our     approach.Bentley is committed to offering an electric model in its     future portfolio and we are interested to receive feedback on     this concept.In an interview at the Geneva Motor Show, Durheimer toldBloombergthat part of the idea is to find out if it's time for Bentley to   develop an electric model -- or if its customers will continue to   be happy with combustion engines and hybrids for the time being.   (Bentley will roll out its first plug-in hybrid next year.) If   the electric concept is well-received, Bentley could have an   electric model on the market by 2021, he said.But whether it turns out to be the right time or not, an   electric Bentley is coming, thanks to an opportunity created by   Tesla.Why Tesla's success creates an opening for an electric   BentleyBentley, like other super-luxury brands, is eyeing the market   segment above vehicles like Tesla's Model S and Model X. Those   Teslas are broadly competitive with the upper-tier models from   luxury brands likeBMWand Mercedes-Benz in terms of performance and features (and   price). But there's space for something even more luxurious.Brands like Bentley, and its British competitors Rolls-Royce   and Aston Martin, have for many years found a small but   profitable market in luxury cars that are a step up from the   likes of BMW and Mercedes. Now, they seean opportunity to build carsfor well-heeled, electric-car enthusiasts who might be happy   Tesla owners today, but might also be interested in an   opportunity to move up to something more deluxe, more   personalized.Bentley's typical attention to hand-crafted detail is far     from ordinary, even by Tesla or BMW standards. Image source:     Bentley Motors.To credibly appeal to Tesla owners, Bentley will have to   incorporate high-quality technology into its eventual electric   car. That shouldn't be a problem: Bentley Motors is owned by   giantVolkswagen AG(NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) , and will presumably take advantage of the   battery-electric technology being developed for its sibling   brands, Audi and Porsche.That technology is thought to be quite advanced: Audi plans to   launch a battery-electric SUV aimed directly at Tesla's Model Xearly next year. An electric Porsche sports sedan is expected to followabout a year later.It may or may not exactly match Tesla's technology. But it   should be close enough to satisfy customers drawn to Bentley's   other attributes -- customers that will be interested in an   electric Bentley largely because of Tesla's success.Another view of the Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept. Image     source: Bentley Motors.So will Bentley go electric?I think it's likely that Bentley will go electric. The total   world market for such a Bentley might only be a few thousand   models a year, at most -- at least at first. But this is a brand   that sold a grand total 11,023 cars worldwide last year. Given   that an electric Bentley would be using technology sourced from   its corporate parent, it doesn't seem like it would have to sell   in huge numbers to turn a profit.With Europe and China moving more aggressively toward electric   vehicles, and all of those Tesla customers in the United States,   it seems likely that a well-done Bentley with a competitive   battery-electric drivetrain would find enough customers to make   the effort worthwhile. We'll likely find out in another year or   so.10 stocks we like better than Volkswagen AGWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN) Q4 Earnings Raise Some Red Flags;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeading into theUrban Outfitters, Inc.(NASDAQ:URBN) fourth-quarter earnings report, there were two areas of focus for investors. Urban Outfitters already released Q4 sales figures in early February. Flat comparable-store sales for the period were below expectations, but URBN stock still gained modestly on the news. As such, trailing revenue wasn't likely to be a major point of emphasis in the Urban Outfitters earnings report.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Rather, the focus was on margins, and on fiscal 2018 (ending January) guidance. And on both fronts, expectations were low. MKM Partners downgraded URBN stock on Feb. 27, specifically citing margin pressure at Anthropologie. Wunderlich cut its price target for URBN to $26 on Monday, projecting compressed margins from higher online sales. Goldman Sachs already had cut Urban Outfitters stock to ""Sell"" in early February, on concerns of overall retail weakness going forward.Urban Outfitters earnings for Q4 appear to support those concerns - even though shares have risen modestly in after-hours trading.The same pressures dogging the entire retail sector appear to have made their way to Urban Outfitters. That's not pushing URBN stock lower in Tuesday after-market trading, but it could in the weeks ahead.Urban Outfitters Earnings Show Margin PressureMany retailers have responded to the endless omnichannel threat driven byAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) by building out e-commerce businesses of their own. But until recently, investors hadn't quite understood the inherent problem with that strategy: It hurts profit margins.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonAdding an e-commerce supply chain and other capabilities on top of an existing brick-and-mortar footprint simply adds more cost. And to compete with online-only rivals, retailers must cut price as well.Urban Outfitters specifically cited that problem in its Q4 release. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was down 142 bps year-over-year. The issue, per URBN, was ""primarily"" delivery and supply chain costs. Those costs were elevated by increasing DTC (direct to consumer sales). For the quarter, flat comparables were driven by a double-digit increase in DTC revenue - offset by declining sales in-store.The formula of ~flat revenue and increasing e-commerce share implies margin and profit pressure - and that's exactly what happened to Urban Outfitters earnings. Net income declined 12% year-over-year in Q4, with EPS missing analyst estimates by a penny. And declining profits won't support URBN stock, which still trades at nearly 14x EPS at after-hour prices. (To be fair, the multiple is closer to 12x including the company's ~$3 per share in cash and securities.)Sales and Profit Growth Questions Remain For URBN StockThe problem coming out of the fourth-quarter release is that those margin pressures aren't likely to abate. In fact, CEO Richard Hayne said in the Q4 release that Urban Outfitters wouldincreaseits focus on DTC sales. Store occupancy costs were flat as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. But further revenue weakness in store could add deleverage on that line as well - and further pressure Urban Outfitters earnings.From a sales standpoint, there wasn't much new information in the release, though the post-earnings conference should give more color. It does appear that the Urban Outfitters brand, which accounted for 40% of FY17 sales, is reasonably well-positioned. That brand did have higher markdowns in Q4 - but lower discounting on a full-year basis.The other 60% or so of the retail base, however, may have some concerns.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Anthropologie sales declined in Q4, as mentioned, even with higher markdowns. And Free People saw lower gross margin in FY17 - again, due to higher markdowns.URBN Stock Isn't That CheapAll told, there's enough in the Urban Outfitters earnings release to suggest some potential problems for URBN stock in 2017.It's not as if Urban Outfitters is all that cheap, either. A 12x-plus cash multiple mightsoundinexpensive, but it's in line with most of the retail space.Gap Inc(NYSE:GPS) trades at similar levels, as doesAmerican Eagle Outfitters(NYSE:AEO). Both of those stocks are coming off decent years - in my opinion,betteryears than Urban Outfitters. AEO, in particular, given its ownership of Aerie, has a growth catalyst that URBN stock may not at the moment.Retail in general is an extremely tough space, to the point that some observers have called the sector simply ""uninvestable."" I tend to agree with that characterization. Those investors looking to enter the space need to chose only the best companies, with the least risk. Urban Outfitters is one of the better companies, but I'm not sure it's quite top-tier.And coming out of Q4, there are a lot of potential risks to both sales and margins in fiscal 2018.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Closed-End Funds That Have Big-Time YieldsIs Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017The postUrban Outfitters, Inc.

Chevy Bolt U.S. Deliveries Decline in February;3/7/2017;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) began deliveries of its all-new, fully electric   Chevrolet Bolt inDecember, and the $37,500 vehicle is a strong alternative toTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) upcoming $35,000 Model 3. As the first   affordably priced fully electric vehicle with over 200 miles of   range per charge (238 miles of EPA-rated range to be exact) to   hit the market, the vehicle is an important foundational step for   GM.But GM's acceleration into the long-range electric vehicle   market has not been smooth. Bolt sales in the U.S. pulled back   slightly in February compared to January. However, this doesn't   mean the new vehicle won't make a splash this year.Chevy Bolt. Image source: General MotorsmakeArticleAd();Bolt deliveriesThe trajectory of Bolt deliveries in 2017 so far isn't showing   the sharply rising curve that will be required if GM is to hit   the approximately 25,000 to 30,000 deliveries management is   reportedly targeting (perReuters) for the year. Bolt deliveries declined from 1,162 units in   January to 952 in February.In addition, the company's February sales release dropped its   January reference to the Bolt's fastest days-to-turn rate in the   industry --  a measure of how quickly a vehicle sells to a   customer after arriving on a dealer's lot. For January,   management boasted of a days-to-turn rate of just seven days for   the Bolt.Bolt. Image source: General MotorsIt's not clear how many vehicles GM expects to produce in   2017. In January 2016, GM manager of electrification technology   communications Kevin KellytoldHybridCars that the company would be able to fill orders for up   to 50,000 customers in 2017 if demand reached that level. But in   November 2016,Wall Street Journalauthor Adrienne Roberts paraphrased GM spokeswoman Michelle   Malcho assayingthe Bolt ""is expected to meet high interest, but will be offered   in limited quantities in 2017.""A national rollout is just getting startedAll of GM management's comments point to limited production   and availability of the Bolt during the first half of the year.   Indeed, in February's release, management noted that the   ""national rollout of the crossover is just under way."" Further,   when The Motley Fool asked Chevrolet electric vehicle   communications spokesman Fred Ligouri for a comment regarding the   Bolt's production, he provided this statement:We're ramping up production and delivering inventory to new     markets each month, including the addition of New York and New     Jersey in March. We have a number of units in transit and look     forward to welcoming new Bolt EV owners to the Chevy family in     the weeks and months to come.Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk is arguablybullish on the Bolt's potential. In November, the CEO said he thinks a car like the Bolt should   sell in volumes of hundreds of thousands of units per year. His   confidence likely stems from the nearly 400,000 deposit-backed   reservations he watched come in for Tesla's upcoming Model 3   shortly after its launch.Of course, GM hasn't indicated it's planning for Bolt   production anywhere near that level. But that doesn't mean it   won't be bringing a higher-volume electric vehicle to market   soon.GM is entirely familiar with the process of ramping up vehicle   production. If demand for the Bolt is high enough to solicit   30,000 deliveries during 2017, it could likely pull off the feat   of manufacturing that many in the second half of the year alone.   So that will be the period investors interested in the electric   vehicle space will want to watch closely. As the Bolt becomes   more widely available in markets across the U.S., production and   deliveries will likely soar.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Wins When Everyone Stays Home;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat do the pizza and big-box retail industries have to do withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and the performance of NFLX stock going forward?makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSurprisingly, a lot.Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ) recently got a boost from better-than-expected quarterly results. Meanwhile,Target Corporation(NYSE:TGT) is in a slump after disappointing Q4 earnings. DPZ is up more than 70% since the start of 2016, while TGT is down 20%. As weird as it may seem, the simple parallel between Domino's recent success and Target's recent failures underscores a secular shift in the consumer economy which strongly favors NFLX stock.CNBC's Jim Cramer is calling it the ""stay-at-home economy,"" and it's showing up in everyone's earnings reports. Companies - such as Domino's and Netflix - that cater to this mentality are thriving; those that don't are struggling.Netflix stock hasn't been the only big winner from this shift. Delivery-centric quick service food stocks like DPZ andPapa John's Int'l, Inc.(NASDAQ:PZZA) are up big since the start of 2016. More traditional quick-service food stocks that don't focus on delivery, likeMcDonald's Coproration(NYSE:MCD), have struggled recently.Non-store retailers and online marketplaces such asAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN) andEtsy Inc.(NASDAQ:ETSY) have surged. Meanwhile, traditional retailers likeWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) andMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) are rapidly changing their business models to stay relevant.In a nutshell, though, that is the problem with staying long the stocks that have been early winners of the ""stay-at-home"" shift. Everyone is catching on, and most are catching up.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksIn the food industry, services likePostmatesare gaining popularity, and that is democratizing food delivery. In retail, all mall retailers are focused on building out an omnichannel presence, and free shipping is becoming more of a regular. Competition for services in the ""stay-at-home"" economy will only intensify.With one exception: Netflix.Why Netflix Is DifferentIn many ways, Netflix pioneered the stay-at-home economy. In 2011, the company split its DVD rental and streaming services. Consumers weren't pleased, and about800,000 membersquit Netflix.The dissatisfaction was short-lived, though, as consumers began to realize they could access a robust entertainment library from their couch for an affordable monthly fee. Over the next several years, Netflix dramatically grew its user base, NFLX stock soared, cord-cutting became the thing to do, and everyone started moving to over-the-top content.As everyone moved to OTT, Netflix's competition began to stiffen. Investors began to question the company's competitive moat. Netflix's response was to spend big on original content. That big spend, though, weighed on earnings. With competition up and earnings down, Netflix stock flat-lined for most of 2016.Until the Q3 report.The original content slate ofStrangerThings,Narcosand Marvel'sLukeCageduring the summer of 2016 drove exceptional sub growth. The Q4 report showed just as much promise on the original content front.Today, Netflix has almost94 million membersand is growing with exceptional pace considering the scale of the business. In other words, even several years after its pivot to streaming and many new competitors later, Netflix remains the premiere service in the streaming video on demand marketplace.Bottom Line on NFLX StockYes, Netflix stock trades at an absurdly high trailing price-to-earnings multiple, but that multiple doesn't capture the extent of Netflix's value.Is Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?The international growth story is just getting started. Original local content across the globe is bolstering international sub growth. That market is much larger than the domestic one. The early success of Netflix's original content continues to widen the company's moat. Higher quality original content allows for higher unit revenues (or ARPU). Higher unit revenues allow for higher margins. Overall, big sub growth plus higher unit revenues should lead to not only outsized revenue growth, but outsized earnings growth as well.Netflix made staying at home cool. The market for providing services in the ""stay-at-home"" economy is getting more and more crowded. Netflix, however, seems to be immune to this competition.Netflix remains the premiere service in a secular growth space, and Netflix stock remains a must-own in a hot market.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NFLX.More From InvestorPlaceSnap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is About to ReboundShould I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 ConsThe postNetflix, Inc.

3 Reasons the Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW) Stock Rally Will Continue;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the heels of a standout earnings report last week,Lowe's Companies, Inc.(NYSE:LOW) shares gained about 7%. It stood in stark contrast to many other retailers - likeMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) - that have struggled with the impact of e-commerce. Let's face it, the mightyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to wreak havoc on brick-and-mortar operators.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)But so far, Lowe's has been immune. Then again, when it comes to home improvement, consumers still like to make a visit to a big-box location.OK then, so what about Lowe's stock now? Is there still room on the upside? Well, I think so. For the most part, the momentum looks sustainable for LOW stock. And here are three reasons to keep in mind:Reason No. 1 for Lowe's Stock: Positive Macro EnvironmentAgain, the latest quarterly report shows that the company is on a nice growth path. Note that revenues jumped19% to $15.78 billionand comparable sales rose by 5.1%. By comparison, the Street consensus was looking for revenues of $15.39 billion and comparable store sales of only 2.4%A key to the strength is the positive fundamentals for the home improvement industry. After all, there has been a steady increase in real estate prices, which has encouraged more spending.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchAccording toLowe's CEO Robert Niblock: ""Expected growth in the home improvement market is further support of the results of our fourth quarter consumer sentiment survey, which revealed that post election, homeowners have an increasingly favorable view of the national economy and their personal financial situations and we believe this trend will continue, as almost half of the homeowners we surveyed indicate that they are very likely to begin a home improvement project in the next six months, and more than half of homeowners believe that home values are rising and will continue to increase.""Reason No. 2 for LOW Stock: Omnichannel SuccessIn the retail world, the concept of ""omnichannel"" is a common buzzword. It's essentially about providing customers with consistent experiences across in-store and digital platforms.Of course, LOW stock has been pursuing this strategy for some time, such as with a revamped website and improved mobile apps. Oh, and there have even been cutting-edge innovations with VR (Virtual Reality) and robots, which help answer questions in Lowe's locations.And the investments are really starting to pay off. During the latest quarter, the comp growth for Lowes.com jumped by 25%. Interestingly enough, digital traffic is growing at 15 times the store traffic since 2010 and mobile accounts for a quarter of overall traffic.LOW stock has also been skillful with leveraging online channels for marketing and branding campaigns. For example, the company's Pinterest page has over 3.4 million users. What's more, Lowe's has been active in creating engaging videos for platforms likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) FireTV andRoku.Yet the omnichannel strategy has not just been about technology. Just look at the rollout of the interior project specialist program.Is Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?This involves highly trained employees who help customers to plan, design and complete home improvement projects.Reason No. 3 for Lowe's Stock: Shareholder ValueDuring the fiscal year, the companyrepurchased $3.5 billionof Lowe's stock. And yes, the board recently authorized a new program for up to$5 billion in buybacks.As for the valuation on Lowe's stock, it is fairly reasonable. Keep in mind that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 15X. By comparison,Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) trades at a multiple of 18X.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Is Just Giving Away Money;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn November, I shared how to generate free profits being longBaidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU). But this time, the earnings lotto wasn't too lucky. The breakout in BIDU stock fizzled as traders sold on the news.makeArticleAd();Source:Simone.Brunozzi Via FlickrFundamentally nothing has changed for the company. Baidu still is a solid bet for the long-term. The setback was from pure price action and not based on any obvious execution or operational issues. So as long as markets in general don't correct, BIDU stock should find footing soon and remount another rally.Even though I have good reason to go long the stock, though, I am not about to risk $173 per share on this hard line. Today, I will set a trade using the options markets that gets me long Baidu stock for free and with room for error.How to Trade BIDU StockThe bet:Sell the BIDU Sep $130 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collected $2.5 per contract to open. I need Baidu shares to stay above my sold strike to win. The 24% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success.Click to EnlargeI only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at my strike price. Otherwise, I could turn this trade into a credit put spread. Yes, I would be limiting my potential profits, but I would also gain an advantage. The risk of a credit put spread is finite. When selling naked puts, I suffer losses below my breakeven point all the way down to zero.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!The Alternate:Sell the BIDU Sep $140/$135 Credit put spread. I collect 95 cents per contract to open. The buffer is slightly smaller here, but I still can yield 20% on risk with 90% theoretical certainty.Usually I like to hedge my bet and sell upside risk for balance. But in this case, I will delay this action. I don't leave myself open to a short position going bad on me if BIDU bounces. Since I am using longer-dated contracts, I am comfortable that I will be able to manage the short term price gyrations.The Juice (Optional):I could make my bet even more bullishly biased by adding a debit call spread. I also will delay this action until I see clear evidence of the bounce. Then I would buy the BIDU Apr debit call spread at the money. I pay half of the width of the spread for the chance of doubling my money.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Repairing My Tesla Model S Has Been an Utter Nightmare -- and It's Mostly Tesla's Fault;3/7/2017;"Seven months, three weeks, and three days.That's how long it's been since myTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S was involved in an accident and Istilldon't have my car back. That's nearly eight months of rather   large monthly payments for a car that I'm unable to drive; nearly   eight months of incrementally higher costs associated with   insurance and registration for a car that's sitting in the shop;   nearly eight months of having to find and arrange alternative   transportation; nearly eight months of having to buy gas again,   while the gas savings had previously offset part of said large   monthly payments; nearly eight months of impatiently waiting to   get back a car that I absolutely love; nearly eight months of   regularly prodding Tesla for updates with little to no   success.My Model S, shortly before the accident. Image source:     Author.makeArticleAd();You may assume that my car was involved in some sort of   catastrophic incident that required a protracted period of time   to repair. Nope. It was a run-of-the-mill accident (more details   later). Tesla is predominantly responsible for why it is taking   so long, because out of those eight months, over five of them   were spent doing nothing but waiting for parts.Let me back up a bit and start from the beginning.Jan. 27, 2016: Delivery dayIn late 2015, my wife and I decided to take the plunge and buy   a Model S. We had been longtime supporters and investors in the   company, firstbuying shares in 2011. We finally pulled the trigger in December of that year. In   order to save quite a bit of money, we opted for a certified   pre-owned (CPO) model, which cost about a third less than a   comparably equipped new Model S would have cost at the time.At the time, the Colorado state tax credit ($6,000) for   electric vehicles could be claimed on used vehicles provided that   the car has never been registered in the state. (The state credit   was recently amended to exclude used vehicles, effective starting   2017.) So we found one that was located in New Jersey, and even   after paying the maximum transportation fee ($1,500), it still   easily worked out in our favor. It was less than 2 years old and   had less than 20,000 miles on it; not bad for what we saved by   going CPO. It was even the exact same shade of dark green as my   first car, a color option that had since been discontinued --   bonus nostalgia points.Delivery day at the Tesla service center. Image source:     Author.It took about a month for the car to arrive, but we   immediately fell in love with it. We started taking road trips   more often (within the bounds of the Supercharger network, of   course), and frequently found excuses just to drive and enjoy the   instant torque.Like most Tesla customers, we became involuntary but not   unwilling advocates for the company, fielding a constant string   of questions from friends, family, and strangers regarding how   the car worked as well as about the necessary behavioral   adjustments associated with going all-electric. We also attracted   the typical confounded stares when we'd put something in the   frunk, or put the kids in the rear-facing seats that we had Tesla   retrofit post-delivery.A couple months after taking delivery, we placed a reservation   for a Model 3 on March 31, the day that Tesla unveiled the   vehicle and started taking deposits.July 11, 2016: Accident dayI was actually at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California,   when the accident occurred (I worked for Tesla very briefly   during the summer of 2016). My wife called me frantically,   exasperated that she had been involved in an accident. Most   importantly, she was largely unharmed; just some minor whiplash   that she quickly recovered from. She was more concerned that the   car had been injured. She had been driving home from work,   sitting stationary at a stop light, when a young driver failed to   hit the brakes in time and rear-ended the vehicle at a relatively   low speed.Here's the picture I asked her to take of the car immediately   after the impact:Immediately after the accident. Image source: Author.It looks worse than it was, in part because the Model S and   Model X contain more aluminum than most vehicles. Aluminum   crumples much easier than steel since it's a softer metal. This   is also an important safety feature since the crumple zones are   both larger and able to absorb more impact, with the downside   being that aluminum is more expensive. A consequence is that   Tesla accidents look really bad because the vehicles get mangled,   but the functional benefit is minimal intrusion into the   passenger cabin.Less than six months after we had taken delivery, our Model S   was off to the shop.Nearly eight months later...While Tesla performs most routine service itself, it   outsources major body work to a network of third-party body shops   that are certified by Tesla. The certification process is   expensive and time-consuming, but certified body shops will   garner most of the local business (there is only one certified   body shop in my immediate area).Shortly after receiving my damaged car, the body shop started   tearing down the vehicle to assess the damage, and ordering the   parts that would be necessary for the repair. The vast majority   of the repair time has been gobbled up here. I had heard and read   stories about Tesla parts taking longer to deliver relative to   the rest of the industry, but that's somewhat expected for a   young car company with just one factory.Anecdotally, stories of it taking two to three months for Tesla to deliver   parts are not uncommon. After three months had passed and the   body shop had still not received all the necessary parts, we   began reaching out to Tesla directly through their customer   service channels, which serves as a liaison to the internal parts   department.At the body shop. Image source: Author.Initially, no customer service representative that we   interacted with was willing to take ownership of our issue. We   kept getting passed between representatives with little to no   useful information (a customer service manager eventually took   ownership of handling our issue after repeated escalations).   Parts had started to trickle in, but there still weren't enough   to start the repair so our car continued to sit idly. Two of the   more pertinent parts were a rear lift gate and rear quarter   panel, which were still outstanding. During one of the   escalations in November (four months after the accident),   Tesla guaranteed us that all parts would arrive at the body   shop no later than the last week of November. They didn't.In mid-December, the shopfinallyreceived enough (but not all) parts to start working on the car.   At that point, the holidays were nearly upon us, and every   industry slows down around that time of year. The body shop would   begin the repair in early January 2017 after the holidays. There   were still a few outstanding parts, including bulb rivets. I   would think that something as basic as rivets would be among the   easier parts to deliver, but evidently I'm wrong (and not alone). We again contacted customer service, and Tesla again assured   us they had just shipped the remaining parts for overnight   delivery. Frankly, we didn't have much faith at this point, as we   had been told this before. But in the final week of January, the   shop confirmed that they had indeed received all remaining parts   necessary to complete the repair. It looked like light at the end   of the tunnel, six months in. At this point in the story, the car   has spentmore time in the shop than in our possession.A couple weeks ago, the body shop updated us that the car was   about to enter the paint shop, at which point it should only be a   couple more weeks to reassemble the painted pieces and then   perform electronics calibrations and a few other outstanding   items. It turns out that the 12V battery is also now in need of   replacement, as it will no longer hold a charge (perhaps related   to how long the car has been sitting idle?). The shop ordered the   battery a week and a half ago. Tesla uses exactly one specific   supplier for its 12V batteries, which is struggling to keep up   with Tesla's demands. We're now looking at yet another delay for   the 12V battery, which is a part that most people are able to   purchase for their vehicles locally within 15 minutes.As soon as Tesla delivers this battery, the car will be ready   within a day or two. It's supposed to be ready this week, but at   this point I have incredibly low expectations, as we are again   waiting on Tesla to deliver.Look, Ma: No car!Tesla is known for having a generous loaner policy when   vehicles are being serviced, but sadly this policy does not apply   to body work.The driver that hit us was uninsured, so we had to file our   claims through our collision coverage, and we have coverage for a   rental. But our rental coverage maxes out at 45 days, which is   typically sufficient time for most body repairs. Having already   known that our repair would probably take at least two months, I   knew we would need to arrange alternative transportation. Even if   we opted to use our insurance company's negotiated rental rates,   it would cost approximately $1,000 per month to rent a car.   That'sin additionto the monthly loan payments that we are still paying.Fortunately, my parents are retired, and as such have little   need for their cars. My mother graciously agreed to let me borrow   her car as long as needed, which relieved us of having to bleed   out a small fortune ($7,000 by now) in rental fees for an   indefinite and still ongoing period of time.What this means for investorsTo say that this whole experience has been traumatizing would   be an understatement. As long-standing investors and   newfound customers, it has profoundly shaken our faith in Tesla   as a company. Thus far, Tesla has not given us a reason as towhyour parts were so severely delayed, so we have no indication as   to whether or not this is a one-off exception or if there is some   systemic problem within Tesla's parts operations. While we've   been waiting, Tesla has delivered tens of thousands of vehicles,   including about 29,000 Model S sedans.Some of Tesla's weakness here is certainly related to its own   ability to produce parts, which continues to improve every month.   Theoretically, parts production should improve as Tesla continues   to ramp its overall manufacturing capacity, but it seems like   this can't be the only reason. I'm mildly confident that my case   is an outlier, but even if it is, it's still disconcerting that   situations like this can slip through the cracks after repeated   escalations and assurances.It also calls into question Tesla's ability to support its   existing customer base, which is of critical relevance to whether   or not Tesla can support amassivelylarger customer base. The company is still targeting 500,000   units in 2018. As many analysts and pundits point out, the   mainstream is far less forgiving for this sort of thing compared   to enthusiastic early adopters.We are now questioning our Model 3 reservation. We haven't   finalized our decision, nor will we have to for a few more   months. Owning two Teslas now seems like a significant risk   should one of them ever be involved in any type of accident,   small or large. In sharing our story with other Model 3   reservation holders, we know that a few of them canceled as a   direct result, since our run-of-the-mill repair has devolved into   an utter nightmare.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos Wants to Dominate Outer Space;3/7/2017;"The Milky Way (Shutterstock Photo)Is there any place in the universe too big for Jeff Bezos to want to conquer?After crushing the world of retail, technology, shipping logistics, and a host of current projects poised to disrupt or create new markets, why wouldn’t Bezos think he could dominate outer space? The Amazon (AMZN) CEO, who currently ranks at the world's third-wealthiest person, has pioneered space launch company, Blue Origin, which is expected to reveal some customers and new initiatives this week.makeArticleAd();With what began as just an interesting idea, Bezos, a self-proclaimed ""space geek,” has already established tons of credibility for Blue Origin, which offers a family of reusable rockets powerful enough to penetrate deep into the solar system for suborbital voyages. Bezos envisions one day humans establishing a permanent settlement on the moon. It’s more than just a pipe dream. And given his Midas track record, Bezos’ space exploration plans should be taken seriously.The capabilities of Blue Origin, which has grown over the past year, can now blast both manned and robotic missions not only to the moon, but also to various planets. Flight safety tests are ongoing on the company’s New Shepard suborbital rocket, which Blue Origin built in-house and reportedly can take paying passengers into outer space some time next year.Blue Origin rivals the powerful rockets currently being touted by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's SpaceX. While Musk appears to have a sizable lead on Bezos, given that SpaceX already has several rockets under development, Blue Origin has already caught the attention of NASA, which is already working on its own version of a deep-space booster and capsule,according toThe Wall Street Journal.What’s more, Bezos’ quick space advancements with Blue Origin has already won the distinguished Heinlein Prize for ""progress in commercial space activities that advances [the] dream of humanity's future in space."" Meanwhile, Aviation Week proclaimed Blue Origin its 60th Annual Space Laureate. And the fact that Bezos is willing to partner with NASA and bankroll space exploration underscores the will with which his interstellar ambitions run.Notably, the cost of Blue Origin and how it can be funded is one of several key differences with SpaceX. Bezos recently described ""the cost of admission ... is quite high.... So very few experiments get done."" Still, as the world’s third-richest person with almost $70B in net worth, Bezos can buy time to perfect Blue Origin. This race for outer space suggests that space is indeed the new frontier. Whether it’s the final frontier, as Star Trek claims? That remains to be seen."

GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Gutted? Time to Go Long!;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company, yet Wall Street experts expected so much more out the GPRO story. They even once labeled it as ""a YouTube killer."" I betAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) management wasn't too worried then. That exuberance marked the top for GoPro stock.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)Now, GoPro stock gets a downgrade under $9 per share. I'm sure it's no coincidence that this coincides with the IPO ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which had a successful offering last week. Money is probably flocking out of GPRO and into SNAP stock, perhaps to recoup some losses there.I think the two have little in common. GoPro stock is a play on a line of action cameras known for being rugged and for active outdoorsy people. We see videos of extreme base jumping pros to teens clearing a two-foot hedge in their front yard. So far, SNAP appears to capture more general scenarios.The hate for GoPro stock should abate eventually. It still has cool products with very few high-profile direct competitors. I don't have a lot of faith in management, but just like in the case ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), I think someone will eventually figure the stock out. But for this morning, GPRO stock is down 7.8% on a downgrade from Goldman Sachs.Click to EnlargeBased on that logic, I want to risk a little on a speculative trade going long GPRO stock. I could risk $8 to buy the stock, but instead I will use the options markets to risk even less. My thesis relies on GoPro stock eventually becoming attractive to old fans who revalue their re-entry levels.I do have to note that GPRO is in danger of inviting more technical sellers if it loses these lows. So I will snipe out the entry, perhaps in two tranches.The Bet:Sell the GPRO Jan 2018 $5/$3 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents to open per contract. If successful, this trade would yield over 30% on money risked. I need GPRO stock to stay above my sold spread to win.Yes, it is a gamble to try and catch falling knives, especially one like GPRO. But I need to add a few speculative plays to my portfolio, and this one qualifies. Again, an underlying assumption is that GoPro will eventually survive. But I don't need it to thrive to profit.Usually, I like to balance my risk by selling upside risk. In this case, however, I won't. GoPro stock has fallen too far, too fast, and I would be selling risk at a severe discount. If GPRO bounced hard, I would face self-inflicted risk against my own thesis.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is the New Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)I could juice my bet by buying upside calls, but I will wait out a few more trading hours to flush out an interim bottom. I don't want to turn this trade into an investment yet, however, since I've already said that I don't have much faith in GPRO management's ability.I am not required to hold my options trade option through their expiration.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is the New Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) sold off hard following a fourth-quarter earnings report that fell short of the market's lofty expectations. Despite reporting better-than-expected revenue of $2.28 billion on the quarter, Tesla stock delivered an earnings loss much larger that the market anticipated.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs Tesla stock was already up more than 26% year-to-date headed into earnings, it's not surprising that the stock sold off.I've written many times about the dangers of investing in Tesla stock at its current market valuation.Tesla's 2017 run pushed the stock's market cap to around $45 billion, roughly in line with that ofFord Motor Company(NYSE:F). It's difficult to fathom such a high valuation for a company that shipped just 76,000 vehicles last year and burned through another $448 million in cash in Q4.The market may have higher hopes for Tesla stock than any other stock on the market. But long-term TSLA bulls don't care about Q4, or even 2017 for that matter. They aren't just investing in an auto company. They believe Tesla Inc. will change the world.The Tesla Stock Bull Case Is About QualityTesla stock bulls believe that it doesn't matter how many cars the company delivers in the short term. They feel the autonomous driving technology that CEO Elon Musk is developing will make Tesla vehicles the best in the world in the next decade.General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) has gotten a head-start on the long-range electric vehicle mass market. But TSLA appears to be on track to be the first to market with a fully-autonomous vehicle.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowLast year, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla had already driven222 million cumulative autopilot miles. Those miles are extremely important because the precious data they provide, which allows for fine-tuning the technology. By comparison,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo driverless car has logged only about2 million milesof data.If Tesla is the first to market with a driverless car, its data advantage will quickly compound exponentially. That huge advantage could make it very difficult for competitors to catch up.TSLA Stock Valuation Not an IssueThe scariest part about Tesla stock for most investors is its valuation. The stock already seems to have priced in tremendous long-term success.Compared to auto rivals Ford and GM, Tesla's valuation is bordering on absurd. Ford and GM, however, may not be Tesla's most appropriate peers. In fact, bulls might argue that TSLA stock is much more similar toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Loup Ventures recently argued that Tesla stock today looksa lot like AMZN stockback in 2009. Both companies have been struggling to turn a profit. Both stocks have also already delivered huge gains in relatively short amounts of time.""Today, Amazon still struggles to make money, but shares have risen 10x over the past 8 years and are near all time highs,"" Loup writes. ""Amazon had the roadmap for the future of commerce and web services, similar to Tesla's roadmap to pursue the future of auto and solar, based on their core competencies in AI and robotics.""Tesla Controls Its Own DestinyAs long as the market keeps its appetite for growth, Tesla's projected 16%-22% CAGR in vehicle sales through 2025 could be plenty to keep the stock on an upward trajectory for the next decade. TSLA bulls need not even concern themselves with the electric vehicle fleets from GM or Ford. If Tesla can deliver the world's first and/or best driverless car, it is well on its way to securing a major long-term growth source.UBS Says Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Has 26% UpsideIn the meantime, Tesla stock will likely continue to defy value investors. If TSLA is the new AMZN, bulls can ignore earnings, debt, P/E ratio, competition and pretty much everything else about Tesla's business.

Why Utilities and Solar Companies May Be Finding Common Ground;3/6/2017;"As the solar industry becomes more competitive, both within   the industry and with fossil fuels, companies are having to   figure out where they most efficiently fit into the market. For a   while, solar companies thought they may have an advantage in   developing and owning solar projects, leading to the structure of   many of the companies you know today.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andCanadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) all bought development companies to build large   projects, andTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity was always a solar developer that   owned the systems it built. And all of these companies either   planned to own solar systems long term or drop them down to   yieldcos.As this was happening, utilities across the country began to   develop their own renewable energy strategies. The beginning was   buying renewable energy projects from developers, including the   solar companies mentioned above. But with more experience,   they've moved more and more into solar project development   themselves, cutting out the middleman.As the solar industry and utility industry begin to collide,   each has to figure out where they fit in the new world of energy.   And we may be seeing some hints about where the industry will   land in the long term.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Utilities learn their renewable energy roleAs utilities have entered the solar market, they've found that   that there are places where they hold an advantage over solar   companies. They may not ever manufacture solar panels or create a   great racking system, but they have a lower cost of capital than   solar companies. When the yieldco yields rose and made it   difficult for solar companies to drop downs assets to an entity   they controlled, utilities had an opening because they still had   a low cost of capital.What also makes sense is that utilities will move from buying   completed solar projects to developing them in-house.NextEra Energy,NRG Energy, andDuke Energyhave all developed renewable energy development arms that do more   than just buy projects.To that end,AES(NYSE: AES) bought solar developersPowerfor $1.58 billion late last month. AES has been a leader in   developing energy storage solutions around the country, and now   it's a leader in solar as well.What about solar companies?While utilities are moving more into development, there's   still a big role for solar companies to play. They may not be   doing financing and site selection, but they'll be making panels,   designing tracking solutions, and making integrated solutions   that utility developers will use.If you look at the strategy changes at First Solar and   SunPower over the past year, they fit into this new energy world   perfectly. They've moved from project development to supplying   solutions, such as Oasis from SunPower and the Series 6 product   from First Solar. They're expanding their offerings beyond solar   panels into racking, site design, and inverters, but they may not   be moving as far into the industry as owning projects long   term.Even Tesla is selling most of its energy storage solutions to   utilities or other third-party developers rather than storing   them on the balance sheet.Sticking to what you do bestThere will continue to be tension between utilities and the   solar companies upending their business, but the tension may not   be focused on the utility side in the future. It makes sense for   utilities to stick to project ownership and some development   work, while solar companies offer plug-and-play solutions where   developers need energy. This may lead to a more stable solar   industry long term, and it will make it less risky for investors,   too.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

How Apple Could Spend Its Cash Hoard;3/6/2017;"The problem ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) cash balance is a ""first-world problem"" in   the most literal sense of the phrase.Slightly larger than the annual economic output of Chile,   Apple's cash and marketable securities stockpile lies largely   overseas. As of the company's most recent earnings report, $230   billion of Apple's $246 billion, roughly 93%, was held in   accounts controlled by Apple's international subsidiaries.Apple has caused quite a stir thanks to its controversial   decision to park its foreign profits abroad rather than pay what   it argues are onerous and unfair repatriation taxes. However, the   whiff of tax policy overhaul percolating on Capitol Hill means   this dynamic could soon change. In anticipation of such a   scenario -- and in part because it's just fun to consider -- here   are three realistic ways Apple could deploy its billions in the   bank in the years ahead.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.Idea 1: Major acquisitionApple being a mature company, you often see investors float   the idea of the Mac maker using its cash to fund a major   acquisition whenever this discussion appears. The idea isn't   without merit, either, although it is more complex than it might   seem on the surface for a few reasons.The first hurdle lies in correctly identifying a large company   that jives with Apple's plans for its own future. In terms of   companies that I (subjectively) think could conceivably pair well   with Apple, only a handful of plausible candidates come to mind.   Among them areTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) , andComcast(NASDAQ: CMCSA) (NASDAQ: CMCSK), three legitimately viable   options among publicly traded companies.We know Apple is interested in -- or possibly in the midst of   --developing an electric vehiclefrom the many leaks about its Project Titan, though we don't know   much more than that. Tesla makes the most sense among automakers   for a few reasons. Much like Apple, Tesla's mission is to   fundamentally alter the industries in which it operates. Its   headquarters in California would make working together simpler   than coordinating across the country with Detroit.In a similar vein, Comcast and Netflix both cater to Apple's   long-held desire to launch its own content streaming service.   Apple's ability to secure content rights from major producers has   been the main thorn in its side. Both Netflix and Comcast control   considerable content rights, though Netflix is newer to this   game. As such, owning either Comcast or Netflix could supply   Apple with the negotiating leverage it needs to finally bring the   required parties to the table.Unfortunately, acquiring any of these companies would require   Apple pay a significant premium to their current prices, which   could be particularly troubling for already-expensive stocks like   Netflix and Tesla. There are also integration, cultural, and   regulatory considerations that could make such a maneuver highly   complex for Apple, though the idea isn't entirely without   merit.Idea 2: More capital return?This comes from the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school   of thought since Apple has thus far used its cash reserves to   finance its dividends and share buybacks. To do so, Apple has   cleverly used its overseas riches as collateral to borrow against   to fund its massive capital return programto great effect.Apple has paid out a whopping $201 billion of its current $250   billion capital return program as of its most recent earnings   report, including $15 billion in dividends and buybacks in its   latest quarter (Q1 FY 2017). Apple generated $27 billion in   operating cash flow last year, and its capex requirements are   minimal -- $3 billion last quarter. This makes the status quo   seem sustainable, although the recent rally inApple stockmakes this option increasingly less appealing.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Stock buybacks become less effective as a company'svaluation increases, so Apple's dramatic multiple expansion has made this tactic   less attractive than it was a year ago. However, with Apple still   trading at a discount to the market, and its cash balance rising,   there's certainly a fair case to be made that further buybacks   and dividends remain a worthy use of Apple's riches.Idea 3: Finance important capex?If Project Titan is indeed real, I think the chances of Apple   implementing this third idea are quite strong. One of the most   important questions Apple must answer along the way is how will   it manufacture the electric vehicle?As I havenotedin the past, automobile manufacturing is a capital-intensive,   low-margin business. This leaves Apple facing a potential   catch-22 with Project Titan, driving meaningful sales growth   while also dramatically eroding its now-cushy profit margins in   the process.Perhaps the best solution to this problem is to follow a   tactic similar to Apple's contract manufacturing arrangements   with Asian assembly specialistsFoxconn. Apple designs products and maintains quality control, but it   hands over the actual widget-making, the low-margin part of the   process, to someone else. This is how the majority of Apple's   consumer electronics get made today.The key speed bump with this idea is that there are no   large-scale automotive contract manufacturers that exist today to   provide this service to Apple, and that's where Apple's mountains   of money come into play. Assuming it finds a willing and capable   partner to build Project Titan, Apple could use its cash to   finance the construction of the factory infrastructure necessary   to bring Project Titan to life.In fact, Apple has pursued a similar strategy in the past. It   partnered with the now-defunct GT Advanced Technologies to   finance the construction of a factory that GT Advanced planned to   use to produce commercial sapphire for Apple's fingerprint   scanners. If it does so, Apple will want to take great care to   avoid past mistakes, like bankrupting GT Advanced under the   onerous terms of its financing deal. Regardless, this idea is   sound as long as Apple's auto ambitions are indeed as real as   portrayed in the media.Cash is kingOf course, this only scratches the surface in terms of   possible uses of Apple's cash. U.S. tax policy overhaul will also   have a significant influence on Apple's options, so interested   investors will want to stay in tune with the national discussion   around it in the coming months. At the end of the day, though,   Apple's billions in the bank provide it with unparalleled   flexibility to pursue any number of possible actions, and that's   something in which Apple investors can and should find great   comfort.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Ionic Materials and the Plastic Battery: What You Need to Know;3/5/2017;"Pure, metallic lithium. This is a holy grail. These are     what will make an electric car side-by-side competitive with     the internal combustion engine.--Steve LevineIonic Materials enables use of lithium metal anodes, sulfur     cathodes, and more. The result is much higher energy density     and performance.makeArticleAd();-- Ionic MaterialsStab a battery with a screwdriver? Cut it in half? Don't try     this at home -- unless it's a plastic battery from Ionic     Materials. Image source: Ionic Materials.Have you readThe Powerhouse, Steve Levine's epic tale of scientists at the Argonne National   Laboratory working to invent a new battery that will make   electric cars lighter, and let them drive farther, at half the   price of car batteries today?Or perhaps you caughtNOVA'sFeb. 1 episode, which offered a slightly different take on   America's ""search for the super battery"" that will power our   smartphones, our laptops, and even our cars in the future?If so, you may have noticed: All of a sudden,battery science is cool.Building a better TeslaIf you've been following the story of Elon Musk and the   Gigafactory thatTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is building in the Nevada desert, you may be under   the impression that Musk's ""18650"" lithium-ion batteries are   currently the height of battery technology. Well, they are and   they aren't.Lithium-ion batteries were first commercialized bySony(NYSE: SNE) back in 1991. And, yes, if you pack enough of them   onto a car chassis, you can make a Tesla drive 200, 250, or even   300 miles on a single charge, and yes, that's a greater range   than most other electric cars offer today. But even the 18650s   that the high-tech Gigafactory will churn out employ the same   basic lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum chemistry that's been in use   for more than a decade.Employing a liquid electrolyte to shuttle lithium ions between   anode and cathode, 18650 batteries still carry at least a (small)   risk of incurring a catastrophic meltdown, such as the incidents   thatsunk Samsung stocklast year. And relying on a limited volume of lithium ions (about   2% of the battery's volume), intercalated within a graphite   anode, 18650s still provide less power than you could get from a   pure lithium metal anode -- the aforementioned ""holy grail.""Luckily for electric-car enthusiasts and ""green power""   afficionados, there's a better battery on the way.Introducing Ionic MaterialsIt's called the solid polymer lithium metal battery, and it   was invented in 2011 by Tufts professor and former Bell Labs   researcher Mike Zimmerman, who's now working to   commercialize the prototype for mass production through his new   company, Ionic Materials.Instead of a liquid electrolyte, Ionic uses a solid polymer (a   plasticlike material) to allow lithium ions to flow from anode to   cathode and back again. According to Ionic, this novel type of   electrolyte::offers the ability to function as the cathode     electrolyteexhibits high conductivity at room temperaturehas high voltage stabilityis non-flammableis conducive to high-volume manufacturing techniques.Ionic also uses a lithium metal battery, so there are more   lithium ions to move. That means Ionic's battery packs a   whole lot more punch than the lithium-ion batteries in use today.   Oh, and because it's basically a piece of plastic, it's almost   infinitely malleable and can be manufactured in form factors   conducive to different uses -- long, wide, and flat for powering   tablets or cylindrical to power flashlights. Why, it could even   be molded to fit where needed within a car chassis.As a bonus, it's worlds away from today's lithium-ion   batteries in terms of safety. On last month'sNOVAepisode, host David Pogue attacked Ionic's battery with a   vengeance, piercing it with a screwdriver and snipping off bits   with scissors. Not only did the solid polymer lithium metal   battery not explode (as any other lithium-ion battery would   have), it actually kept working, powering an iPad even as it was   hacked to pieces.When will it arrive?No, you cannot buy one, at least not right away.Ionic Materials was recently awarded a $3 million Advanced   Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) grant from the   Department of Energy. Funding will begin early this year, which   will help to get the ball rolling, but Ionic's battery is not yet   available commercially.The company is ""actively discussing potential partnerships   with leading multi-national materials companies, battery   manufacturers and device OEMs."" But Ionic has released no details   on its potential partnerships as of yet -- meaning we don't yet   knowhow   to investin the technology.That said, Ionic Materials says it expects to find a partner   and begin manufacturing its polymer super-battery as early as   next year.

Here's the notable   segment from the filing:In December 2016, we entered into a Production Pricing     Agreement: Phases 1-3 ... with Panasonic Corporation, Panasonic     Corporation of North America and Sanyo Electronic Co., Ltd     (collectively, Panasonic). This agreement provides that     Panasonic will manufacture custom photovoltaic (PV) cells and     modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and that we will     purchase certain amounts of PV cells and modules [from]     Panasonic during the 10-year term, with the intent to produce     PV cells and modules totaling approximately 1 gigawatt annually     beginning in 2019.It's also worth noting that Tesla said Silevo won't meet its   last two milestones associated with the acquisition -- related to   reaching target efficiencies and manufacturing volume and cost --   and recorded an $84 million gain as a result of the contingent   payouts that will now not be made, an amount which was recorded   as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses.The solar manufacturing situation at Tesla appears to be a   complete mess, and with Silevo out, Panasonic is nothing more   than a traditional supplier. It's hard to see how that will lead   to lower costs or higher efficiency than just buying solar panels   on the open market.SunPower has more big plans in ChinaWord trickled out this week thatSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR)  has signed a deal with Tianjin Zhonghaun   Semiconductor (TZS) and China Eastern Electric Group (Dongfang   Electric Corp.) to create 5 GW of P-Series manufacturing in   China. The agreement was actually reached last week, but   interestingly, management is keeping the deal low-key; it hasn't   made an official announcement yet.The joint venture will reportedly have the two Chinese   companies each owning 10% and SunPower owning 80%. It is the   second big move for SunPower into China after it tried to produce   the C7 concentrator product, which hasn't taken off as planned.   This deal is intended to leverage domestic cell supply to create   solar panels that are slightly more efficient than   competitors'.If this joint venture does create 5 GW of solar panels, it   could be transformative for SunPower. The company would enter a   new level of scale in the solar industry, with a product more   competitive in the utility market than its high-efficiency panels   have been. Time will tell if the agreement works out as   planned.Image source: Getty Images.Update on the solar policy fightThere were two major policy decisions this week that will   impact the solar industry. The first is the EU Commission   extending solar trade duties on Chinese solar cells and modules   for another 18 months. This is notable becauseCanadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) ,Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) , andJA Solar Holdings(NASDAQ: JASO) have alldropped out of a minimum price schemein Europe and are now paying a tariff that's around 50% of the   cost of a solar panel, depending on the manufacturer. The tariff   will put a damper on demand in Europe, but given the cost   advantages these companies have in China, falling prices   make the impact less and less meaningful.Solar companies and electric company Arizona Public Service   (APS) have settled a contentious rate-design dispute that will   give residential solar a little life in the state. APS won't be   implementing demand charges for all residential and commercial   customers, and will instead give customers the option of a   demand-based rate or time-of-use rate. New rooftop-solar   customers would have to pay a grid access fee but would be   compensated for energy exported to the grid, albeit not at the   same rate as net metering. It's not a perfect solution for solar   companies, but it'll keep the industry from collapsing   overnight.Earnings that slipped through the cracksThere were two notable solar-related earnings reports this   week, fromPattern Energy Group(NASDAQ: PEGI) andNRG Yield(NYSE: NYLD) , that showed some improvement in the yieldco   space.Pattern Energy said that gigawatt-hours sold jumped 33% in the   fourth quarter to 6,806 GWh, revenue was up 7% to $354.1 million,   and cash available for distribution jumped 44% to $133.0 million.   The company also announced a 1.4% increase in the dividend this   quarter, to $0.41375 per share.NRG Yield's results were fairly mixed, with adjusted EBITDA   (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)   rising from $189 million a year ago to $207 million in the recent   fourth quarter. But the company also swung from a quarterly net   income of $12 million last year to a net loss of $126 million.   These losses aren't necessarily an indication of fundamental   weakness, given that most were impairment losses, which are   non-cash charges and don't impact operations.Check back next week for another recap of what's sure to be   another busy week in solar energy.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla, Inc. Sales in China More Than Tripled in 2016;3/3/2017;"AsTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) prepared to begin deliveries in China in 2014,   management was particularly bullish on the market. Indeed,   Tesla's former China operations chief Veronica Wu estimated sales   in the country would quickly grow to represent a third of the   automaker's deliveries globally. But Tesla's initial predictions   for the market proved to be far too optimistic. Sales in the   market accounted for just 15% of total revenue in 2014 and fell   to 8% of revenue in 2015.In 2016, however, Tesla hit a major turning point in the   country. Tesla revenue in China surged higher in 2016, more than   tripling compared to revenue in the market during 2015, according   to Tesla's most recent 10-K filing (as pointed out byElectrek).Tesla vehicles. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();An unimpressive startAfter beginning deliveries in China in October 2014, hype   surrounding Tesla's expansion to the market faded quickly. Tesla   realized a substantial portion of initial demand was driven by   scalpers, and it dealt with some public relations missteps   related to misperceptions about the difficulty of charging its   electric vehicles in the country.""I'd say that China was certainly a lot weaker than expected,""   Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an interview at the Automotive News   World Congress in January 2015.Despite initial challenges in the market, Tesla remained   confident in the market's long-term potential, and Musk said he   believed the company's situation in the country was   temporary.Tesla spent 2015 working on its image in China, including a   massive expansion of its Supercharger locations. Between the   beginning of December in 2014 and the beginning of January in   2015, Tesla added 16 new Supercharger locations in just 30 days,   bringing total Supercharger locations in China to 56 in early   2015.Supercharger. Image source: author.Tesla's aggressive investments in China continued. Today,   Tesla has 114 Supercharger locations in China. Further, Tesla has   dramatically expanded its footprint of stores and service   centers. Tesla now has an impressive 23 stores and 9 service   centers in China.From $319 million to $1 billionTesla started to see signs of a recovery in the second half of   2015. After orders for Model S nearly doubled between Q1 and Q2,   Tesla said Model S orders ""increased substantially"" in Q3   compared to Q2. And management indicated this growth was poised   to continue.""We expect order growth in China to remain strong with more   store openings and the recent policy changes in Beijing and other   major cities that allow buyers of Tesla vehicles to bypass   license plate restrictions,"" Tesla said in its Nov. 3   third-quarter update.Tesla's predictions for sustained order growth in China have   proved accurate, as Tesla's revenue in China surged from $319   million in 2015, or 8% of revenue, to about $1.1 billion in 2016,   or 15% of revenue.China has undoubtedly proved to be a key catalyst for Tesla.

Ahead of Model 3 Production, Tesla Inc.'s Spending Is About to Soar;3/3/2017;"Even though 2016 was a big year of growth forTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , as revenue and vehicle deliveries soared, the   electric-car maker's capital expenditures during the year   declined impressively compared with 2015. But Tesla investors   shouldn't get comfortable with this lower level of spending:   Management expects capital expenditures to jump during the first   half of 2017.A temporary pullbackTesla's pullback in capital spending last year was certainly   notable. Capital expenditures declined from $1.6 billion in 2015   to $1.3 billion in 2016. Even more, expenditures were far below   the $2.25 billion threshold Tesla said it expected to hit by the   end of the year.Tesla factory. Image source: Author.makeArticleAd();However, despite a slowdown in capital spending during 2016,   Tesla still managed to grow its business substantially:Revenue and deliveries soared 73% and 51%, respectively,     year over year.Between July and the end of the year, Tesla's Gigafactory     grew from 1.9 million operational square feet on its multiple     levels to4.9 million square feet.Production of battery cells began at the Gigafactory.Global store and service center locations increased     26%.Supercharger connections increased by 46%.Tesla ramped up Model X production from a few hundred units a   quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015 to nearly 10,000 a quarter   by the end of 2016.Meanwhile, Tesla emphasized throughout the year that its less   substantial capital spending in 2016 didn't mean the company   wasn't hitting its milestones for its capital plan. The lower   level of spending, management explained, was simply a byproduct   of careful expense management, capital efficiency, and more   favorable payment terms with suppliers.Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler explained how the company has been   able to stretch out payables longer than expected in the   company's fourth-quarter earnings call:I think this is one of the benefits of having a very     successful run over the last couple of years. We have developed     a lot of trust with our suppliers ... to sum it up, we're     making great progress in stretching out our payables, and we're     doing that in a way that I think is productive and healthy with     the relationships with our suppliers and members.Tesla's capital efficiency and progress on payment terms in   2016 was an impressive feat.Big spending is already underwayHowever, while this year-over-year decrease in capital   expenditures highlights Tesla's careful expense management and   capital efficiency, it doesn't diminish just how   capital-intensive it will be for Tesla to launch its Model 3 in   the second half of 2017 and to ramp up production from a run rate   of 100,000 Model S and X units today to management's expected   annual production of 500,000 units for Model S, X, and 3 combined   in 2018. Tesla still expects a significant jump in capital   spending -- and the sharp increase is already getting   started.Tesla's under-construction Gigafactory. Image source:     Author.As Tesla readies Model 3 to come to the assembly line in July,   management expects to invest between $2 billion and $2.5 billion   in capital expenditures in the first half of 2017 -- an   approximately 190% increase from capital spending in the second   half of 2016.Tesla has already begun demonstrating a ramp-up in capital   spending. In its fourth quarter, Tesla invested $522 million in   capital expenditures, up from $248 million in Q3.Increasing production capacity fivefold isn't going to be   cheap. And investors are about to get a taste of just how   capital-intensive the auto business is.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com, Inc.: How to Buy AMZN Stock at a Much-Needed Discount;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's more than OK to like purchasing fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). But if you're looking to buy AMZN stock, it may be smarter to delay that buy decision. That's because you can wrap up a discount using the proper technique.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs most consumers know by now, there's a lot to like about shopping at Amazon. There's also a lot to like these days about AMZN stock. A month ago, the online retailing gianttrumped profit viewsby nearly 12.5% in delivering earnings of $1.54 per share.Sales for Q4 did come in a tad light, but the sheer size of Amazon's $43.7 billion in revenues for the holiday quarter, can't in our opinion, be discounted too much without looking like the Grinch. After all, sales grew by a nothing-to-sneeze at 27% to $136 billion for the full year, powering a three-fold increase in profits over 2015.Cash flow also jumped 38% to $16.4 billion, and the company's latest growth engine, Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivered a solid 47% in its quarterly sales.So, what'snotto like about AMZN stock right now?Management did trim, to put it mildly, its profit outlook for 2017 with a range of $250 million to $900 million versus the Street's forecast of $1.33 billion.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The good news is Amazon's warning isn't nearly as damaging as it looks on first inspection. The ""weak"" guidance factors in aggressive investments in media, fulfillment and India. And as proof, after an initial and apparently short-sighted ""sell, sell, sell!"" by investors - Amazon stock has delivered the gift of fresh all-time-highs just last week.But are Amazon shares offering you something worth buying right now?AMZN Stock ChartLooking at Amazon's chart, the question ""Is it, or isn't it?"" comes to mind as shares flirt with a multiday test of its prior highs from October.Click to EnlargeWith a substantial corrective move wedged between the former high of $847.21 and price action over the past week or two, AMZN stock has put together either a bullish cup-with-handle or potentially bearish variation on the classic double-top pattern.Which side holds the directional edge moving forward? My best estimate is there's some likely pressure in Amazon's near future.First off, one warning is that Amazon shares officially broke out on Feb. 21 but have had difficulty going higher. Also worrisome is Amazon's ability to rally strongly past the breakout level, which has been accompanied by less-than-terrific volume and a lack of support from stochastics.We expect modest profit-taking, so if you're interested in buying AMZN, there are better times - and ways - to enter.How to Trade AMZN StockFor investors that do wish to eventually purchase AMZN stock at slightly more advantageous prices or maybe a much larger discount and get paid to wait it out-a credit put spread looks attractive.Reviewing Amazon's options and given our view of shares prone to at least a modest pullback, the Weeklys 07' April $815 / $810 put spread is priced for $1.00 with AMZN stock at $847.60.Is the Reversal in Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock a Buying Opportunity?The real disadvantage with this strategy is if our forecast is wrong and shares of Amazon rally higher by a meaningful amount. Were that to occur, the trader's $1.00 in profits will look like a poor decision relative to buying AMZN stock today.But if AMZN sits or simply fails to drop below $815 or nearly 4% over the next five weeks, the full credit is captured and the trader will be sitting pretty compared to a more bullish trader that simply purchased stock.Even better, if more aggressive profit-taking does happen, ultimately the vertical limits the investor's risk to $4.00 regardless of how low AMZN stock might go during the spread's holding period. And opportunistically, if the investor is still inclined to be a buyer of Amazon shares, that can work out to a very sizable discount.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla Inc (TSLA);3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeadlines and oversold stocks take the lead on today's three big stock charts, as we take a look at the charts forCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT),Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) to determine whether one or all of these are ready to offer traders bullish opportunities as they potentially regain their recent highs.makeArticleAd();Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)Caterpillar shares plummeted on Thursday as news thatfederal agencies had raided some of their corporate offices. The stock's dive was stopped by the 100-day moving average. This trendline has now served as support for Caterpillar shares three times since October 2016.Typically, a headline-driven selling day like this can be hard to step in on, but a few other things didn't happen that would have served as warning of greater declines.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowFirst, CAT stock did not break below its lower Bollinger band, signaling that, as volatile as yesterday's move was, it still fell within a somewhat normal distribution for the stock. Second, the stock didn't move far enough away from its 50-day to imagine that we couldn't see it move back above this key trendline today.These two points, along with the fact that yesterday's selling volume suggests that investors may have rushed out of CAT stock too quickly, leaving a vacuum that may be easily filled by buyers, now leads us to take a short-term bullish trade outlook on Caterpillar shares.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)Say it ain't so! Could this be it for the long-term bullish run in Nvidia shares? The stock broke through the psychologically important $100 level earlier this week and has seen an acceleration in selling since then. Now, shares are trading at $96.65 and looking helpless. Well, not exactly.Nvidia is getting ready to hit potential support at its 200-day moving average. This is the same line that the stock came close to grabbing support from last week before a short-term bounce. In addition, Nvidia shares are also touching down to oversold reading of their RSI, indicating that the selling pressure that has been moving the stock lower may start running thin.That said, what would a bullish trade look like on Nvidia? Well, we want to see support at $94.35 hold, as NVDA hits these oversold readings. This should be enough to trigger a short-term rally. From there, we want to see NVDA take out the 50-day moving average, which is currently at $107.63 (of course, after breaking above $100 again). This would put shares back into rally mode.The risk? A break below $94, or rejection at $100 on a short-term rally, will likely open the path to another selloff that could see NVDA shares break to $80. This one is well worth keeping an eye on.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Ahead of Tesla's earnings we talked about the ""buy the rumor"" rally that signaled us to stay on the sidelines with the stock for the report. Well, the ""sell the news"" action took the stock back to its 50-day moving average where things are beginning to look more attractive for Tesla from a trading perspective.The stock shed 13% after the report to hit its 50-day trendline at $240. Conveniently, the $240 has also showed some signs of round-numbered support and resistance in the past on the Tesla chart.While shares did not hit an oversold reading on the RSI, they did work their way out of an extremely overbought situation that had developed ahead of earnings. This means that the stock would be moving against less of a headwind to rally higher from this point.Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Is Fundamentally Strong, Which Is Why I'm Shorting ItOur scoring system continues to rank Tesla shares as a ""buy"" based on the strong technical and fundamental results of the company with targets that are nearing the $300 level. The latest round of technical support should clear way for traders to take the stock back to its short-term highs at $280 over the next few weeks.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in March7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Caterpillar Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales Ever;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs last year's holiday sales were ramping up,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) faced claims that its Apple Watch was in trouble. Smartwatch sales were down - with AAPL doing worse than most - and some analysts were calling for a miserable Q4. Apple CEO Tim Cook even took the unusual measure of speaking to the press to claim Apple Watch sales were actually off the charts.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleHowever, IDC just released its numbers for Q4 wearables, and it looks like Apple was right. It booked its best Apple Watch Q4 numbers to date.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), on the other hand, didn't do so well.The IDC Numbers on Q4 2016 Wearables SalesIDC just released itsnumbers for Q4 2016 wearables sales. This covers both fitness trackers and smartwatches. Overall sales were up 16.9% year-over-year with 102.4 million wearable devices being shipped during the quarter, worldwide.The firm noted a continuing trend toward smartwatch makers adopting an activity tracking approach, while traditional fitness tracker makers - like Fitbit - scrambled to add features, becoming multi-use devices.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Moving Markets - LiterallyThe results for the quarter show that Apple's strategy of making its second generation smartwatch even more fitness focused paid off, with record Apple Watch sales.IDC had this to say:""AppleWatch Series 1 and Series 2 proved to be a magnificent success for the company as it was the company's best quarter ever in the wearables market. The lower entry price point and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2 along with a completely revamped user interface have helped the company grow its presence. Apple is one of the few companies that has been able to quickly refocus its watch to gain traction in the consumer market and has also been leading the charge on introducing the smartwatch category to the commercial segment.""Fitbit, on the other hand, had a miserable quarter. Its smart wearables like the Blaze weren't enough to fend off the Apple Watch.The U.S. market (where its marketing is focused) is approaching saturation for basic fitness trackers. China'sXiaomicranked out cheap fitness trackers and added new more upscale models with features like heart rate tracking.As a result, for Q4 Apple Watch sales were up 13% (to 4.6 million units for the quarter) and Xiaomi was up 96.2% (5.2 million units). Fitbit maintained its first-place position, but sold just 6.5 million units, a 22.7% drop compared to last year.Q4 Smartwatch Sales Show AAPL's Fitness Focus Paying OffThe IDC numbers vindicate Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments in December. Speaking in response to a a report (from IDC, ironically) that suggested the smartwatch category was in trouble and the Apple Watch would face ""muted"" success,Cook responded:""Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.""That comment was looked at with some suspicion at the time. It seemed a little defensive and vague.Is the Reversal in Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock a Buying Opportunity?The Apple Watch series 2, launched in September, featured a renewed focus on fitness and activity, including a built-in GPS that freed it from the smartwatch for running. A partnership withNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) resulted in theApple Watch Nike+aimed offered sports enthusiasts.At the same time, Apple tweaked the performance of the Apple Watch and has continually improved its watchOS operating system.With record Q4 Apple Watch sales that exceeded the numbers from its launch year -when excitement about the all new smartwatch was running high- AAPL's strategy is clearly paying off. And contrary to that earlier IDC report from last year, the Apple Watch is enjoying better than ""muted"" success.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Buying Snap Today Could Be Like Buying Apple 35 Years Ago;3/3/2017;"Snapchat (Shutterstock photo)Many on Wall Street are comparing Snap Inc. (SNAP) to Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR) and for now, that's okay. All three can be considered social networks, rely on daily active users and generate the majority of their revenue from advertising.In the future, however, Snap may wind up being more like another Silicon Valley giant than the aforementioned ones -- Apple (AAPL).makeArticleAd();Buying stock in Snap today is a bet on CEO Evan Spiegel more than it is on the company's prowess as an advertising behemoth. Spiegel, 26, is a product visionary the world has not seen seen Apple's Steve Jobs and to some extent, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.There are similarities between Jobs and Spiegel, both starting their companies after dropping out of college, are wonderful salesmen and marketers, but the similarities go further than that.Jobs is Spiegel's idol; he has a portrait of the legendary Apple co-founder hanging in his office. When unveiling Spectacles toThe Wall Street Journalthis past fall, he even used Jobs-ian language, saying ""You wanna see it?"" as he took off the towel covering the product. This mentality plays to the culture of secrecy at both companies, not releasing products until they are ready to be talked about.And unlike other technology companies, neither Snap or Apple have ""beta"" products. There is no group of early adopters buying and using a product so the companies can get an idea of how users are interacting with it and then continue to refine. Every meticulous detail is thought out and obsessed over and is not released until it's perfect.Aegis Capital analyst Victor Anthony said the company's most valuable asset is its demographic, with 13-24 year olds comprising nearly 60% of its user base. While these are highly coveted by advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others, Spiegel is the company's most valuable asset. The ability to know what people want before they want or see it is an invaluable trait that very few executives have. It can not be measured or valued, but it's something that investors need to keenly aware of when looking at where to put their investing dollars.Snap has positioned and sold itself as a camera company, having mentioned that multiple times in its S-1. This can allow them to expand into everything and anything that has a camera.Despite the optimism surrounding Spiegel, the stickiness of Snapchat (engagement levels are shockingly high) and the coveted user base, it's not all roses for Snap at this stage.There are concerns about the company's financial picture, as it still generates the majority of its revenue from advertising. Going up against Facebook and Google, which have mountains of user data that advertisers love, can be a daunting task (just ask Twitter).Issues surrounding slowing user growth, the ability for competitors to copy product features, lack of data analytics, no voting control with Class A shares are all valid reasons to be wary of Snap, especially at a $35 billion valuation.But again, it comes down to be at the forefront of an area that's only going to expand with a product visionary for a CEO.Images, whether it's augmented reality, virtual reality, moving or static, are humanity's future. All you have to do is just look at the popularity of Instagram to see why. Snap, with Snapchat, its burgeoning hardware portfolio and most importantly Spiegel, is poised to be at the forefront of this trend for many years to come."

He will bereplaced by Deepak Ahuja, who retired in 2015 after seven years at the company.""I Told You So"" MomentTesla critics, who have been skeptical of the company's financial position and itsrate of cash burn, took Wheeler's departure as the ""I told you so"" moment. Indeed, this is a critical time for Tesla and TSLA stock, particularly as the company aims to compete withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral MotorsCompany(NYSE:GM) in vehicle mass-market production.But while Wheeler's departure after 14 months might seem discouraging, it's not the death blow to Tesla stock that the recent decline might suggest.What's more important is how Tesla can deliver on Model 3 production estimates and boost demand for the Model S and Model X in the quarters ahead. Plus, Ahuja, who will replace Wheeler, is described as a ""very thoughtful"" CFO who understands the inner workings of the company, according to Consumer Edge Research senior analystJames Albertine.Ahuja's appointment could also be a sign that Tesla is maturing and will begin to focus more on profitability and growing its margins,Activate CEO Michael Wolfsaid in an interview with BloombergTV.Because of increased Model 3 production costs, among other growing expenses, Tesla's gross margins showed a significant decline to 19.1% in the fourth quarter from 27.7% in the third quarter. Though the Model 3 is reported ago have a start price of $35,000, Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each car.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beats the OddsAs such, Ahuja's main job coming in will be to convince a jittery market that Tesla won't lose money on each car it manufactures, which appears to be the current trend.Bottom Line for TSLA StockAhuja will rejoin the company in March ahead of Wheeler's April departure in order to ""ensure a smooth transition,"" CEO Elon Musk said during Wednesday's conference call.Betting on Tesla is a wager on Ahuja and a belief that Musk can deliver on his promises. With TSLA stock still down double digits from its all-time high, placing a long-term bet here could pay off.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowNetflix, Inc.

Tesla's Guidance for Model S and X Deliveries: What Investors Should Know;3/2/2017;"InTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management   understandably refrained from providing guidance beyond the first   half of 2017. Given that the second half of the year is expected   to include the unpredictable production ramp of Tesla's upcoming   higher-volume Model 3, guidance for such an uncertain outcome   could do more harm than good for investors.But what's interesting about the guidance for vehicle   deliveries Tesla did provide is that it's not nearly as ambitious   as it looks at first glance.Model S (left) and Model X (right). Image source:     Author.makeArticleAd();Understanding Tesla's guidanceFor its expectations for deliveries before Model 3 debuts   during the second half of the year, Tesla said it expects to   ""deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined   in the first half of 2017, representing vehicle delivery growth   of 61% to 71% compared with the same period last year.""This is some big growth, right? It depends on how you look at   it. On a year-over-year basis, this growth is an acceleration   from the 27% year-over-year growth Tesla posted in its fourth   quarter. But when investors zoom out and look at what this means   for the trajectory of Tesla's combined Model S and X units on a   sequential basis, Tesla isn't expecting much growth at all.   Compared to combined Model S and X deliveries in the second half   of 2016, 47,000 to 50,000 deliveries in the first half of 2017   would be up just 0% to 6%.And assuming Tesla's late 2015-introduced Model X continues to   account for a larger percentage of the electric-car maker's sales   over the next few quarters as the company ramps up production of   the newer vehicle, this guidance may mean management expects its   Model S sales to decline. In fact, Model S sales have already   turned downward. In Tesla's fourth quarter of 2016, Model S sales   were down 21% sequentially and 26% year over year.Still a successOf course, if Tesla's combined Model S and X deliveries do   level off at the 100,000-unit run rate they're at today, this   would still be an impressive volume for two luxury models priced   between $68,000 and $168,000. Indeed, Model S is already the   best-selling large luxury sedan in this price range in the U.S.   by a long shot. And Tesla's Model X SUV already accounts for   about 6% of U.S. large luxury SUV sales.Furthermore, based on Tesla's update on demand for Model S and   X in the company's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, a   meaningful decline in combined Model S and X sales in the coming   quarters looks highly unlikely.""Model S and X net order growth remains strong, as we are   continually evolving our products by elevating performance,   convenience, and safety,"" management explained. Tesla also said   Model S and X orders hit a record high during the quarter and   were up 49% year over year.Finally, it's worth noting that abrupt pauses in Tesla's   sequential growth have occurred in the past on several occasions.   Indeed, in 2016, combined Model S and X deliveries declined 15%   and 3% sequentially in Q1 and Q2, respectively, before they   skyrocketed 72% sequentially in Q3.Model X. Image source: Author.It's fair to say, therefore, that year-over-year growth has   proved to be the best way for investors to see the bigger picture   when it comes to Tesla's ability to grow sales. And despite   Tesla's expectations for flat sales going into the first half of   2017 compared to the second half of 2016, it would likely serve   investors well to still take a moment to acknowledge just how   sharp Tesla's year-over-year growth remains.Sure, this doesn't mean Tesla can continue growing Model S and   Model X sales sharply or even at all. But Tesla's continued   ability to increase sales at 50%-plus rates annually since Model   S was first launched demonstrates Tesla's consistent execution on   its growth plans on a year-over-year basis, and it bodes well for   the company's ambitious growth outlook for Model 3.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Auto Stock Roundup: US Sales Decline, AutoZone Misses Q2 Earnings, Takata to Cough Up $1B;3/2/2017;"The auto sector has seen a couple of disappointing events in the past week, with some of the companies' stock price movement reflecting the same.Among the slew of negative developments, light vehicle sales in the U.S. declined on a year-over-year basis in Feb 2017.AutoZone, Inc.AZOreported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results that missed expectations.Tesla, Inc.'sTSLArevenues from China increased over three-fold in 2016, while trade unions claim Ford Motor Co.Fmay cut jobs at its Wales, U.K. plant.Further, Takata has pleaded guilty to criminal charges leveled against it and has agreed to pay $1 billion in relation to its faulty airbags.(Read the previous roundup here:Auto Stock Roundup for Feb 23, 2017)Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories1. U.S. light-vehicle sales fell 1.1% year over year to 1.33 million units in Feb 2017. Per Autodata Corp., the demand for cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks inched down to an annualized pace of 17.6 million vehicles in February, from 17.7 million recorded a year ago.2. AutoZone reported 8.8% year-over-year growth in earnings per share to $8.08 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Feb 11, 2017) from $7.43 in the year-ago quarter. However, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.20.Quarterly revenues improved 1.4% year over year to $2.29 billion in the reported quarter.

Earlier this week, Takata pleaded guilty to criminal wrong-doing in a Detroit federal court case in relation to the faulty airbags supplied by it. The company has agreed to pay $1 billion in penalties, of which it will pay $25 million as criminal fine, $125 million to injured consumers or those who could be affected and $850 million to auto manufacturers currently facing the recall costs. Automakers are in the process of recalling about 42 million affected vehicles.In a separate court filing, the auto makers have been accused of using Takata airbags to save costs in spite of being aware of the risks. Honda, Ford, Toyota, Nissan and BMW AG have been particularly charged.4. Ford plans to cut 1,100 jobs at its Wales, U.K. engine plant, as per trade unions GMB and Unite. However, the company has dismissed the claim, stating that it had no immediate plan for cuts and did not confirm any future plan regarding the same. Last year, Ford had decided to lower investments in Britain due to lack of demand but did not announce any job retrenchment plans.Conversely, the union company heads stated that 1,100 will be laid off, leaving 600 employees at the site, over the next five years. Both the unions have decided to consult their members and a strike is probable. Ford, alternately, proposed that a joint working party be set up with both unions, to identify the future business needs.Ford carries a Zacks Rank #3.5. Tesla's sales in China for 2016 were significantly higher in comparison to 2015. The company's revenues grew to $1.07 billion from $318.5 million earned in the previous year. The company had initially faced concerns in the country, including slow deliveries and apprehensions regarding charging.Tesla also reported 12,243 employees at SolarCity, down 19.8% year over year owing to its target to preserve cash and reduce expenses.

Why Tesla Had to Lay Off 3,000 SolarCity Employees;3/2/2017;"CEO Elon Musk called it ""a dirty word"": synergies.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) acquisition of sister company SolarCity last   year was an incredibly contentious and polarizing deal. Some saw   it as a bailout, while others bought into Musk's vision of a   vertically integrated sustainable energy company. Independent of   which side of the fence you're on, Tesla did commit itself to   realizing $150 million in direct cost synergies within the first   full year after closing. Those cost synergies were largely   comprised of ""sales and marketing efficiencies"" as well as   general corporate and overhead savings.But ""efficiencies"" almost always translates into layoffs when   it comes to mergers and synergies, which is why Tesla had to lay   off 3,000 SolarCity employees last year.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Sales and marketing expectedly took the biggest hitBoth Tesla and SolarCity filed their respective 10-Ks   yesterday, and total headcount saw a 20% reduction to 12,243   employees. That represents a little over 3,000 employees that   were let go, with sales and marketing receiving the most   cuts.Job Function20152016Change (YOY)Operations, installations, and manufacturing6,8735,332(22%)Sales and marketing5,6614,155(27%)R&D and general and administrative2,7392,7560.1%Total15,27312,243(20%)Data source: SEC filings.Last year marks the first time that SolarCity's total   headcount posted an annual decline. Some of this was already   known, although the degree of which was previously unclear. The   company had a high-profile exit from Nevada following an   unfavorable regulatory ruling regarding net metering, which   severely impacted the economic viability of solar systems within   the state.In August 2016, SolarCity alsodisclosedthat it would be working on reducing operating expenses ""to match   the Company's reduced guidance"" on installations, as SolarCity   began shifting its focus away from growth and emphasizing a more   sustainable cost structure. At the time, SolarCity said it would   incur $3 million to $5 million in restructuring charges, while   co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive both dropped their   annual salaries down to $1.The other half of the equationIt's important to distinguish between cost synergies and   revenue synergies. While the $150 million in cost synergies that   Tesla is targeting is important, revenue synergies are just as --   if not more -- important since Tesla hopes to transform the way   that people purchase solar systems. Instead of labor-intensive   channels like door-to-door sales or retail lead generation, Tesla   hopes to create a one-stop shop where customers can purchase a   fully integrated system that includes an electric vehicle, solar   system, and battery storage -- a transaction that could easily be   $70,000 or more.It remains unclear if this vision will resonate with consumers   or if it will prove to be cost-effective, but it certainly has   the potential. Much like with electric cars, solar sales have a   steep educational curve, which is partially why the existing   distribution methods are so labor-intensive. Revamping sales   channels combined with needing to generate cost synergies is a   recipe for layoffs.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If …;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAndroid, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.That's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - which runs its own store and hasits own browser and search engine- Google's take is a mere fraction.What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?Controlling AndroidWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Google's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to getback into Chinathrough its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).Still, Google has its work cut out for itself.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android andstill developing the ""O"" version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be throughAndromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.Over the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago,they were nearly level, but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing ""other bets"" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.Still, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.If assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Stock Is a Falling Machete. Catch It!;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPalo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) reported earnings on Tuesday evening, and the stock market is reacting violently Wednesday morning to the news. PANW stock is down 20% today, and while I'm usually not one to risk my fingers trying to catch falling knives, I find myself interested in today's action.makeArticleAd();Besides, using the options markets, I can structure a trade that would allow me to start long with room for error.Yes, Palo Alto Networks' revenues missed, but fundamentally - very, very broadly fundamentally - not much has changed. As the world becomes more digitally dependent, it will need cyber security more than ever. PANW is a major provider, so it's a matter of going back to better execution on its management plans.Usually, investors will give a company a few passes on bad earnings. Unless specifically stated, the assumption is that it was a temporary bad situation that caused the quarter's disappointment.PANW stock is no stranger to bad earnings reactions - previous drops were entry opportunities that rewarded those who stepped in on red days.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteToday's drop brings Palo Alto stock price close to a level that was defended well since the market lows of February 2016. Furthermore, shares emphatically broke out of the $120 area in 2014. PANW should require a complete breakdown in the story to relinquish it to the bears again.Click to EnlargeMy last trade on PANW was a 2016 winning iron condor between $156 per share and $90. I sold risk against both these levels and was lucky enough to expire both sides for max gains. This is a fast-moving stock, so selling risk could be difficult to manage. When dealing with momentum stocks, I find it best to use longer-dated options.Today, instead of selling a range, I will sell downside risk. The goal: Profiting on a stabilization and partial bounce in Palo Alto shares.How to Trade PANW Stock Right NowThe Bet:Sell the Jan 2018 $75 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $2.5 per contract to open. The 35% price buffer gives this trade a 85% theoretical chance of success. I need PANW stock to close above my sold risk to win. It is important to note that if the drop today is almost equal to the price buffer of this trade. So I have to be ready and willing to own Palo Alto at $85 should price falls below it.Not everyone is open to selling naked risk. I can restructure this trade to better suit milder risk profiles. This trade would also be a better fit for smaller accounts.Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Won't Stop Growing Anytime SoonThe Alternate:Sell the Jan 2018 $85/$80 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 90 cents per contract to open. The 28% price buffer gives this trade an 80% theoretical chance of success. If PANW stock closes above my sold risk, I stand to gain over 20% yield on risk.Usually I like to sell opposite risk to balance my trade. In this case, I will refrain from doing so since the drop is too big and I would be selling the upside risk at a severe discount.Instead, I chose longer-dated options which usually allow for easier risk management should the price action continues to go against me. I am not required to hold my options trades open through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

3 Catalysts That Will Propel Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) remains a strong brand that is backed by some of the biggest names in sports, including Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Jordan Spieth and many more.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, a disconnect exists between the Under Armour brand and UAA stock, as the company'sfourth-quarter reportmade it clear that investors had expected too much. Management, too, was equally guilty of inflated expectations.Long-term investors are certainly feeling the pain as Under Armour stock trades near multi-year lows while the markets trade at all-time highs. Better days are ahead, though, and I have three convincing arguments as to why.UAA Stock Catalyst: Expectations Are ResetNow that the damage to UAA stock has been done, step one of the rebound is to exceed the now-lowered expectations. Let's take a look at what the Street is modeling in the near-term. According to data compiled by Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street analysts expect Under Armour's Q1 revenue to be $1.11 billion, which represents roughly a 6% year-over-year growth, but a sequential decline from $1.3 billion in the most recently announced quarter.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Is this achievable? Based on recent history, the answer is a clear yes. In Q4, Under Armour's year-over-year revenue rose 12%, Q3 it rose 22%, Q2 it rose 28% and in the first quarter, it rose 30%.So 6% year-over-year growth is well below the company's historical trend. The easy setup heading into the first-quarter earnings report could represent the first major catalyst that could jolt shares back higher.Baby steps are key here to reestablishing faith in the company.UAA Stock Catalyst: Lapsing of a Major HeadwindUnder Armour is still feeling the pain from Sports Authority's bankruptcy. Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at The NPD Group,toldForbesthat SA's bankruptcy could still haunt UA through Q1, ""but after that the drag should be over and trend should return to normal.""What Powell left out is that Under Armour's products are now sold inKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS) stores, which presents the company with a new distribution expansion opportunity. This also represents a catalyst which peers likeNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) realized years, if not decades, ago. If Under Armour achieves success in Kohl's stores, it could prompt the company to expand into other retail chains. The company'sArmoury shop-in-shop conceptat Champs also serves as a sign of its dedication toward promoting its brand in the mall.Here's a crazy thought - maybe Under Armour can occupy a presence outside of its core sporting goods channel and build up a strong presence at stores like Famous Footwear, which is owned byCaleres Inc(NYSE:CAL). After all, it does sell a compelling set of basketball shoes backed by one of the hottest NBA stars - Steph Curry.UAA Stock Catalyst: New CFO to the Rescue?Under Armour's sales growth has been accompanied with a similar growth in SG&A spend. But since sales are no longer growing at the same pace as previously expected, management would be wise to cut back on spending initiatives (without compromising on the necessary investments to support the brand, such as product innovation and supply chain.)This can be done. For starters, no more acquisitions. No more spending hundreds of millions of dollars for fitness apps - the category is a nightmare - justlook atFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) - so it can cut back here. Also, management can focus on promoting and supporting existing stores without opening new ones and also scale back on marketing expenses.Ironically enough, Under Armour is still searching for a new CFO. So naturally, the announcement of a new executive whose first order of business is cutting spending would be met with cheers.Bottom Line on Under Armour IncAdidas AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:ADDYY) has proven that a down-and-out athletic brand can make a comeback. The global athletic wear market is valued at around $300 billion, which means it is certainly large enough for Under Armour to continue growing and, bit by bit, steal share from the big boys.Elon Musk Is Drilling a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockNo one is saying that Under Armour is the next Nike, but it has proven itself very capable of growing over time. Now that expectations have been completely reset, it is reasonable to believe that UAA can, at the very least, beat the low bar and send UAA stock soaring.As of this writing, Jayson Derrick did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 MLPs to Buy With High (And Growing!)

Best Buy Inc Co (BBY) Stock Dives Into the Retail Dumpster;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBest Buy(NYSE:BBY) announced slightly lower same-store sales during the holiday season, and investors dumped BBY stock in a hurry.makeArticleAd();Source:Austin Kirk via FlickrThe drop was minor, less than 1%. But it was unexpected, and missed analyst estimates of a top-line gain of 0.5%.For the quarter, Best Buy reported earnings of $607 million ($1.91 per share) on revenue of $13.48 billion. This compared with earnings of just $479 million ($1.40) but revenue of $13.62 billion a year earlier. More importantly, while adjusted profits of $1.95 per share easily beat estimates of $1.67, revenues fell short of analysts' expectations, also for $13.62 billion.The revenue shortfall meant analysts threw Best Buy stock into the dumpster with retailers such asMacy's Inc.(NYSE:M), with shares down almost 5% early Wednesday, to $42.40. During the Christmas season, on Dec. 8, the shares traded as high as $49.31.Were the analysts right, or did they just offer smart investors a bargain? IsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) about to kill all retailers, or is this just a case of Moore's Law in action?Great Expectations for Best BuyBest Buy even trounced the higher earnings whisper number of $1.66 per share. But actual estimateswere all over the map, with some very bearish about the company's ability to cut costs and others bullish on margins.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The Zacks Metric Model noted that BBY stock had beaten estimates for four quarters, and that shareholders had been rewarded with a 36% gain. In particular, Best Buy was posting big gains in online sales - the so-called ""omni-channel"" approach - and Zacks was expecting an upside surprise.On the bottom line, of course, Best Buy delivered one. And considering the sizable beat, BBY shares should've rocketed higher.But something else is at play … and that something is Moore's Law.Moore's Law Hits the Top LineMoore's Law, which turned 50 in 2015, was described byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) co-founder Gordon Moore as an expected increase in circuit density on silicon, doubling every 18 months ago as far as he could see, in 1966.But, as I have been writing for many years now, Moore's Law alsoturned traditional economics on its head. Moore's Law is deflationary, and the deflationary impact grows with time, as integrated circuits are incorporated into more and more things, and as the impact is compounded by its use in various ways.In the case of Best Buy, this means the products it sells lose value as soon as they leave the factory, and the retailer is under enormous pressure to get them out the door before their value disappears. This isn't new, but in 2016 it hit one of the company's primary growth sectors: big-screen TVs.A TV that would have been unaffordable just a few years ago - 5 feet wide on the diagonal - is now available at Best Buy forjust $600. More important, flat-screen sets just don't break. I still have one from 2001.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?Best Buy still makes money on that 60-inch set, but the price point is lower, and this is true for all consumer electronics. Whole categories that used to represent big profits, like back-up drives, DVD players and packaged software, have disappeared as consumers find they can get and save files to cloud services.Bottom Line on BBY StockThe new administration wants to whip deflation now and, by allowing price hikes on oil and other resources, they could achieve the goal. China, too, seems dedicated to fighting deflation, giving raises to many workers in a more competitive market.This should mean good news for Best Buy, which is focusing more on products like ovens and washing machines that have mechanical parts which sometimes break. A new round of high-end phones should also help the top line.Bottom line? At a price-to-earnings multiple of under 14, and a dividend yielding 2.5% (that the company is in a great position to raise), BBY stock might be Best Buy's best bargain.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) buysMacy's Inc(NYSE:M). It's a crazy idea, right? AMZN stock has barely budged over the past couple of weeks sincereportssurfaced that Canada'sHudson's Bay Co(OTCMKTS:HBAYF) was in talks to buy America's largest seller of apparel. Clearly, investors aren't holding their breath.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe media, on the other hand, has been busy speculating on the odds of a company like Amazon getting into a bidding war with the iconic Canadian retailer that is run by an American and also ownsSaks IncandLord & Taylor.Opinions vary on whether Amazon boss Jeff Bezos would make such a move, but let me assure you, it won't be for the real estate.No, if AMZN does make a play for Macy's it will be for other, more-sensible business reasons. In fact, you could say Amazon would be taking a page out of the playbook ofBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY), one of Amazon's biggest rivals in electronics retail.How's that, you say? Let me explain.AMZN Apparel Market ShareIn case you missed it, Amazon has been slowly entering the apparel businesssince debutingits own private-label brands in early 2016 with 1,800 products available for sale under names such as Scout and Ro, Franklin and Freeman, and Society New York.Essentially, it's trying to fill the gaps not covered by its third-party sellers. However, a bigger attraction of doing its own thing isn't lost on investors of AMZN stock, which is that you make more selling your own stuff than you do somebody else's.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAccording to Cowen & Co., Amazon is expected to pass Macy's in 2017 as America's top apparel seller and by 2022 should have16.2% market share.While it could do most of this through its websites, having brick-and-mortar stores has always been on the minds of analysts and retail experts alike.""We believe this deal could address some of (Amazon's) major consumer pain points,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen in a recent report discussing the possibility of it buying Macy's. ""Amazon needs better brands, a more curated assortment, a physical place to return items, and customers could use help with ensuring fit - Macy's would also give Amazon greater credibility in curation and fashion authority.""That last part's a bit of stretch. I'm pretty sure if Amazon knocked on your door and you're a private label apparel manufacturer, you'd let them in.Real EstateTo take full advantage of its private label expansion, real estate is going to become an important part of the equation as AMZN expands into brick-and-mortar locations. It's not a matter of if Amazon will do this, in my opinion, but when.Right now there is an abundance of retail real estate coming on stream through all the various store closings across America, including68 Macy's stores- part of the bigger 100 store closings announcement from last summer - in 2017, so finding space isn't going to be a problem for AMZN.If you remember what happened toTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) in Canada, buying all those leases in one big deal ultimately was its undoing because it put way too much pressure on its employees to execute such a big undertaking.So, there is the argument that Amazon could expand one target market at a time until it has stores across the U.S. Unfortunately, that would take a decade or longer to execute. If it really wants to open retail stores this isn't an appropriate solution for a growth company like AMZN.Why Best Buy?Business wasn't looking good for the Minneapolis-based electronics retailer until CEO Hubert Joly turned the company upside down in 2012 implementing its infamous ""Renew Blue"" turnaround plan that turned physical store locations into local distribution hubs for its e-commerce business.Former CFO Sharon McCollamcalled the ship-from-storeinitiative in February 2016 ""one of the most important and strategic decisions in (Best Buy's) history.""The numbers don't lie. In November, Best Buydelivered strongstrong Q3 2017 results that included continued growth for its e-commerce business along with positive same-store sales growth. It's taken multi-channel retail to the next level.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company""Best Buy's third quarter online growth of over 24% results in a very solid quarter, and continues to validate the company's multi-channel transformation,"" Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Sheasaid in November.Renew Blue's been such a success that retail expert Walter Loeb named Joly his 2016 Retailer of the Year.Bottom Line on AMZN StockBy acquiring Macy's, AMZN would be able to push its products onto the store floors where it could learn more about what apparel shoppers want, while seriously lowering its shipping expenses by implementing a ship-from-store initiative much like Best Buy.Yes, it's already invested billions in warehouses across the country, but getting closer to the customer is never a bad thing; buying Macy's might not happen but if it does, it's got nothing to do with owning real estate and everything to do with AMZN owning the customer.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceElon Musk Is Drilling a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Rally Is Nearing Its End7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The postCould Amazon.com, Inc.

While Q4 results were mixed, trends in the wireless business pointed towards stabilization in terms of the subscriber base and the churn rate.Market participants also appear to be satisfied with AT&T's strategic moves like the DirectTV purchase and the pending Time Warner deal even as Verizon's path seems muddled. That said, there is no shortage of issues facing the company, like a saturated wireless market where spectrum crunch is a big issue, persistent losses in access lines, and stringent regulatory mandates.

The company's first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings easily outpaced expectations.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market is making new highs seemingly every day. TheS&P 500,Nasdaq Compositeand other major indices are in uncharted territory, and the stock that value investors doubted is following suit.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is now worth $720 billion by market capitalization. And improbably, the $1 trillion mark - at $189 per share for AAPL stock, that's still a lofty 40% away - is at least in the realm of possibility now.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlso improbably, Apple stock, at around 16 times earnings, is somewhere between undervalued and fairly valued. Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) still believes in the value proposition, adding AAPL shares in the most recent quarter, according to Berkshire's13-F filing.Morgan Stanley has raised its target price on AAPL stock to $154. UBS says Apple shares are worth $138. So the analysts are on board too.But $189?How Can Apple Hit $1 Trillion?If Apple traded at $189 per share without any of its financials changing, that would assume a P/E that has climbed to about 22 times earnings. That higher multiple would have to reflect investor expectations that iPhone 7 sales are growing, though more likely, that the iPhone 8 will be a smash hit.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017That's plausible, considering the woes ofSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, not to mention strong first-quarter iPhone sales.Another way to look at it is through the revenue lens.Looking ahead, Apple projects second-quarter revenue of between $51.5 billion-$53.5 billion and gross margin in the range of 38%-39%. The $1 trillion market cap would value the stock at 4 times sales, up from 3.3 times. And it seems unlikely that investors would trade Apple to those kinds of multiples without anything else happening.Apple needs iPhone sales to grow more than the 5% year-over-year figure last quarter. It certainly needs iPads to reverse a 19% YOY drop in revenue. Services, though, is a huge bright spot, growing revenue from 18% YOY, and the segment is accelerating to become a bigger piece of the revenue pie. Continuing that track would certainly help AAPL's chances.iPhone 8 ReleaseThe biggest continuous headline this year is Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone release, believed to be called either the iPhone 8 or theiPhone X.Currently, while the market is optimistic about AAPL stock, it's not pricing in the potential for double-digit revenue growth in iPhone sales on the back of iPhone 8. That would also include reversing the iPhone's slowing sales in China.Anything's possible in China right now, though.Xiaomi was the leader in Chinese smartphone market share in China in Q1 of 2015. In 2016, Huawei and Oppo took the first and second spot, respectively, in China. Apple's position dropped sharply to thefifth spot. However, cutting prices of the iPhone 7 and promoting that particular model in the region could help AAPL compete more effectively.Another Note About ValuationEven if Apple doesn't blow the doors off with iPhone 8 sales, the market isn't against rewarding gigantic tech titans without them boasting breakneck growth.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a P/E of 30 and P/S of 6. P/E and 6x sales (price/sales). Still, Microsoft is expected to grow earnings by about 7% compared to Apple's 7.6% expected growth this year, and next year the disparity expands, with analysts projecting 13.5% profit growth from Apple but just 9.4% from Microsoft.Speaking of corporate software titans, Apple has partnered withInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) to develop corporate software. In time, Apple will generate more meaningful revenue from this space.Bottom LineLastly, we'll discuss Apple's giant war chest. AAPL has $246 billion in cash, or around $30 a share in net cash. Assuming a 15% repatriation tax (which in theory could go away with aTrump repatriation tax holiday), AAPL will have $23 per share in cash.This is the company's buyback activity last quarter:""We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares.""Apple currently yields a modest 1.7%. Combined with regular buybacks and debt reduction, AAPL stock holders are getting plenty of value out of Apple's cash as it is.The Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Rally Is Nearing Its EndI expect Apple to continue moving higher for all of the above reasons, especially if the broader market continues to melt higher.A lot needs to happen for AAPL stock to gain 40% and reach a trillion dollars in market cap, especially within the next year, but a blowout iPhone 8 release could very well get it done.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

United Rentals, Inc. (URI) Stock Is a Donald Trump Buy;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofUnited Rentals, Inc.(NYSE:URI) are higher by about 20% so far in 2017, and a cool 70% higher since November's election. However, over the past five weeks or so, URI stock has largely trotted sideways - but it has done so in a manner that, through the lens of technical analysis, puts the odds in favor of another leg higher in the not-too-distant future.makeArticleAd();United Rentals is in the business of equipment rental such as forklifts, trucks, diggers for construction of many varieties. That puts URI straight in the crosshairs of the new administration.One of the focal points of President Donald Trump since he's been in office, and in fact since he's been on the campaign trail, has been the ""rebuilding of America"" - specifically as it relates to infrastructure. The promise of spending on the rebuilding of bridges, airports and much more is primarily looked at in two ways:Supporters of the ""plan"" argue that not only is this rebuilding necessary but that it would also bring about a wave of new jobs, which in turn would lead to more economic prosperity.Skeptics of the infrastructure spending point to the financing side of the equation, which would result in a heap of new debt and thus likely difficulty to balance the budget any time soon.I can only say what I think, which is viewed through the lens of probable price action. When it comes to URI stock and other infrastructure plays, while shares have already done heavy lifting in recent months, the path of least resistance remains higher.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Let's look at the charts.URI Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that after bottoming out in early 2016 along with the broader stock market, United Rentals has continually pushed higher.Click to EnlargeFollowing the November election results, URI stock began a steep rally that, earlier this year, ultimately led to a breakout above its 2014 highs and into uncharted territory.Last November, URI also broke past the purple dotted diagonal line of resistance that had been firmly in place since 2014. As a result of this multimonth rally, we also note that the 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (yellow, blue and red lines, respectively) also have begun to curl higher in a more meaningful way.In late January, URI stock gapped higher following its latest earnings results, but then quickly began a multiweek sideways move.Click to EnlargeUnited Rentals has largely been rangebound in recent weeks between $122 on the lower end and $130 on the upper end.Last week, URI announced it was raising more debt in part to finance an acquisition. The company is offering $250 million worth of its 5.875% senior notes due 2026.Elon Musk Is Drilling a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe stock dipped for exactly one day before buyers stepped back in, pushing the stock back to the upper end of this trading range.From here, if URI stock can push and hold above the $130 mark, the next upside target lies closer to the $140 area. Any notable one-day bearish reversal is best to be respected as a stop-loss signal from a swing trading perspective.Like what you see?

Make No Mistake: Tesla Inc Looks To Be Winding Down SolarCity's Ambitious Plans;2/28/2017;"WhenTesla Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought SolarCity for $2.6 billion late in 2016, a   lot of people (including myself) called the deal a bailout of Elon Musk's high-profile solar   company. The deal didn't seem to do anything to advance Tesla's   electric vehicle (EV) business, it will be a drain on cash, and   it was a huge distraction given the business-model change and   manufacturing expansion SolarCity had undertaken.Fourth-quarter results from Tesla released after the market   closed on Wednesday didn't do a lot to change the narrative that   SolarCity and Tesla are still a strange fit together. In fact, it   could be argued that Tesla is winding down some of SolarCity's   business. Here's how to look at Tesla's solar results last   quarter.Tesla's solar roof is under development at the same time     SolarCity's business is shrinking. Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();The shrinking solar ambitions of TeslaSolarCity has been reducing its installation guidance for a   year now, so it shouldn't be shocking that Tesla's results fell   way short of expectations. At the start of 2016, SolarCity   expected to install 1,250 MW of solar in 2016. By the end of the   third quarter, the company had reduced guidance to 900 MW,   implying about 300 MW of installations in the fourth quarter.In reality, SolarCity and Tesla installed 201 MW in the fourth   quarter and hit just 803 MW of installations for 2016. This is an   incredibly disappointing result and the fourth quarter is   traditionally a peak for the company as people try to get   year-end tax incentives.The move to sales from leases is good, right?Tesla touted the $77 million in cash generated during the   final six weeks of the year and the sale of 28% of solar systems,   rather than capital-intensive leases. And on the surface both   look good, but that may not be the case.The cash generation includes tax equity funds being raised   that will be lumpy from quarter to quarter, so it isn't as if you   can extrapolate $77 million in cash generated during those six   weeks into a cash flow projection for the year. In fact,   management said on the conference call that SolarCity's leasing   business would hopefully have no impact on its cash position this   year.What's more concerning is that the energy generation and   storage line item on the income statement showed just $3.6   million in gross margin for the quarter to $131.4 million in   revenue, or a 2.7% gross margin. By comparison, SolarCity   generated a 35.7% gross margin for the third quarter of 2016.   This could tell us that slow sales didn't offset higher costs,   energy storage margins are low or negative, or that solar system   sales are incredibly low margin. No matter what the cause, a   margin that bad can't be good.The move to sales will also come with more competition. A   customer may be more likely to shop around to find the best price   if Tesla is selling systems for cash, which will likely lead to   lower margins.Remember that SolarCity came with over $1 billion in run rate   annual operating expenses, which have to be paid for with the   gross profits from running the business. If profit margins are   terrible, it could lead to the solar business being a cash sink   for Tesla long-term.Is SolarCity's installation arm in trouble?Tesla is talking a lot about turning the solar business into a   more sales-focused business and getting away from leases (more of   a necessity than a choice, in reality). If Tesla is going to move   to a more opportunistic sales model through its retail stores, it   would make more sense to contract installation through local   contractors that will be the boots on the ground, leaving Tesla   to act as a sales and engineering company. This isn't uncommon,   like whenHome DepotorLowe'ssell a kitchen setup orToll Brothersbuilds a house, they use local companies to do the actual   work.But that could entail Tesla laying off thousands of installers   and salespeople who were once at the heart of the business. But   it looks like that's what Tesla is setting up to do, and when you   look at the $1 billion in operating costs, it's the thousands of   workers that SolarCity had on the payroll that add a ton of risk   to Tesla's operations.Tesla hasn't made any announcements yet, but with the scaling   back of solar ambitions and the move to start selling solar   systems through Tesla stores, it would make sense to jettison the   installation arm. And the slowdown in installations last quarter   may be in anticipation of the change.Powerwall. Image source: Tesla.What is Tesla doing with solar manufacturing?Musk and Co. talked a lot about solar manufacturing on   Wednesday and dubbed the Buffalo solar plant Gigafactory 2. Time   will tell if Tesla will be able to make solar panels   cost-effectively, but even if it can, the low output and   potential transition of installations might be a problem for the   plant.When the state of New York gave SolarCity a$750 million subsidy to build the Buffalo   plant, it came with a requirement to ""employ 1,460 high-tech jobs for   the manufacturing operation"" as well as ""employ at least 2,000   other personnel in the State of New York to support downstream   solar panel sales and installation for five years."" This is on   top of 1,440 support and contractor jobs that SolarCity was   supposed to indirectly provide. Tesla may have a hard time   hitting that commitment if it scales back on its installation   fleet.On a more fundamental level, Tesla's move into solar   manufacturing is confusing and disappointing. I don't know why   the company would want to be in the highly competitive solar   manufacturing business, where dozens of companies have gone   bankrupt. And the company's Silevo acquisition, which drove the   move into manufacturing, happened in June of 2014, and we still   haven't seen any sort of manufacturing at scale. There are   promises that the second half of the year will see solar panels   with Panasonic technology start rolling out along with the solar   roof, but until we see product, spec sheets, and pricing,   investors should be skeptical.Tesla isn't making a big bet on solarWith all of these factors considered, it's safe to say that   Tesla is scaling back SolarCity's solar growth ambitions and may   even be shrinking the business altogether. And long-term, that   might be the right move given the tough economics in residential   solar.Investors should keep an eye on the transition Tesla is making   to more cash solar sales and solar at retail stores to see how   strong the investment in solar really is -- and what the returns   are. It may just be a bolt-on product made to make electric cars   look cooler, which may not be the worst thing at the end of the   day, all things considered.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

In our estimation, however, it may be time to buckle up and take a test drive in TSLA stock using a modified spread that will keep investors safer than the competition can. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();It almost appeared TSLA stock knew how to do just one thing this year: drag the Tesla shorts higher and higher, as shares powered forward by nearly 26% in under two months at last week's highs.Tesla's strong rally came despite the company having its share of insults and threats. From cash burn, worries of another secondary, increased risk under a less-subsidy friendly Trump administration and auto competitors gaining traction in the EV car market, investors ignored or shook off a good deal of potentially bearish catalysts.Then came earnings; TSLA stock skidded lower by roughly 6.5% in the report's immediate aftermath. A wider-than-expected loss of 69 cents per share, surprise departure by Tesla's CFO and failure to ramp up deliverables guidance all contributed to investors' less carefree outlook.Building over the past couple sessions despite assurances by management, there's also increased speculation Tesla will delay its Model 3 rollout. The much-anticipated launch is supposed to challengeGeneral Motors Company's(NYSE:GM) electric vehicle Chevy Bolt, which was recently named""Car of the Year""at the Detroit Auto Show.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightNow, there's also Goldman Sachs'downgrade of TSLA stock.The investment bank cut shares to 'sell' from 'neutral,' citing most all the negatives already outlined and estimates Tesla has skewed risk to the downside. Having said that, Goldman isn't always spot-on when it comes totimely recommendationson TSLA stock.Tesla Stock Weekly ChartClick to EnlargeSo is it time to apply the brakes to Tesla's bump in the road or take a backseat behind Goldman?As the weekly chart of TSLA stock shows, shares have entered an area of potential technical support and offer a lower-risk spot to buy shares. However, there are no guarantees when it comes to buying stock and exiting gracefully.Currently, Tesla has seen a common corrective move of 16% that's testing the 38% retracement level, as well as a couple support lines I've drawn on the price chart. The pullback looks more meaningful as it's also challenging the recent key breakout point on the weekly chart, which I wrote about back onJan. 11.Less favorable, the stochastic indicator isn't confirming a bottom and has just turned lower from an overbought condition. The lack of support, though, isn't entirely surprising given the sturdy price run before earnings and quick decline. Yet, it is still viewed as a modest negative for buying into Tesla stock with greater conviction.TSLA Stock Modified Bullish Condor SpreadGiven what's been said and the situation surrounding Tesla since earnings, I don't mind giving away some out-of-the-money upside potential to help reduce the risk associated with paying for a limited-risk spread. My view is that Tesla can rally from here, but new highs in the near-term would likely prove challenging. At the same time, I want to cover my ""you know what"" in the event Tesla stock fails to hold support on the price chart.One modified spread that fits these parameters nicely is the April $250/$260/$270/$275 call condor. With shares at $246.23, the packaged $10 bull call spread and tighter $5 bear vertical costs around $2.70.The breakeven at April expiration is $252.70 and requires TSLA to be modestly higher by about 2.6%. Above $260 and all the way up to $270, the max profit from the bull vertical translates into a profit of $7.30. Below $250, the entire debit will be forfeited.Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back NorthFrom $270 to $275 the smaller $5 bear spread begins to eat into those gains dollar-for-dollar, but ultimately would leave this trader with $2.30 in net profits above $275 in Tesla stock.Bottom line, the imposed limitation on upside is squarely in TSLA stock's pre-earnings and more euphoric price action. And in our view, it's a nice trade-off for helping reduce downside risk during the life of this spread.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

While Q4 results were mixed, trends in the wireless business pointed towards stabilization in terms of the subscriber base and the churn rate.Market participants also appear to be satisfied with AT&T's strategic moves like the DirectTV purchase and the pending Time Warner deal even as Verizon's path seems muddled. That said, there is no shortage of issues facing the company, like a saturated wireless market where spectrum crunch is a big issue, persistent losses in access lines, and stringent regulatory mandates.

The company's first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings easily outpaced expectations. Results were aided by the acquisition of Visa Europe and solid growth in payments volume as well as processed transactions. The analyst likes the company's strategic acquisitions and alliances, technology upgrades and effective marketing efforts. (You canread the full research report onVisahere.)Biogenshares initially gained from the post-election rally, but have since underperformed the broader pharma space as the macro issues plaguing the space still continue. These issues notwithstanding, the analyst likes the stock's strong position in the multiple sclerosis market primarily due to a wide range of products.

Moreover, the upcoming spin-off of the hemophilia business will allow Biogen to focus on the neurology segment, its key area of expertise.

BP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Ride Out Low Oil Prices, But …;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) is among several oil stocks having a difficult time in 2017. The price of oil has moved up and down as investors try to discern demand for oil against the supply that energy producers bring to market. Presently, there appears to be plenty of supply, and this is depressing prices - including in BP stock, which is off 9% this year.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrOil prices have recently rallied to nearly $55 per barrel. A recent report detailed that the inventory of crude oil in the U.S. dropped to 512.7 million barrels, and OPEC, the large international oil cartel that essentially controls the overall level of oil and gas production in the world, is trying to reduce supply.Unfortunately, both oil and natural gas prices remain depressed. Oil is a far cry from the $100 per barrel it traded at just a couple of years ago. At a current price nearly half that high, the largest players in the industry - such as BP stock - are struggling to turn a profit and generate enough cash flow to sustain paying dividends while continuing to explore for even more oil.The key problem with investing in oil and gas stocks is the difficulty in predicting where oil prices are heading. This uncertainty has hit the share prices of the industry's largest companies. I have been covering industry giantExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) insome detaillately and have found that its high dividend yield is great consolation as management comes to terms with the fact that oil and gas prices are depressed, and are likely to remain low for some time.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsExxon's current dividend yield is 3.68%, and XOM stock is hovering close to its low point over the past year. But, since we're getting paid to wait, why not gun for a competitor with an even higher yield?BP is a competing energy giant with a current dividend yield of 7.06%. Shares are also bumping against 52-week lows, and BP stock trades at a reasonable forward P/E near 15x.In contrast, Exxon stock trades closer to 19 times earnings estimates for this year.BP Has a Cash Flow ProblemBP's predicament is similar to Exxon's, in that it's currently spending more than it makes. Back in February, management reported 2016 results. Operating cash flow was $10.7 billion, but the company spent $16.7 billion to explore for and produce oil and gas (the upstream business), as well as refine it into chemicals and related commodities (the downstream business).Further, BP sold assets and businesses to bring in approximately $2.6 billion, but still didn't generate enough cash to support its shareholder dividend. Last year, it paid out $4.7 billion in dividends, which was well below the $6.7 billion paid in 2015.Management plans to continue straightening out the company's finances this year. BP plans to cut capex to nearly $16 billion and expects to raise as much as $5.5 billion by selling more assets and businesses.However, the company still has to pay out billions related to the Deepwater Horizon debacle in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2017, the payouts should range between $4.5 billion-$5.5 billion.For investors concerned about BP's cash flow predicament, consider that the company can likely ride out any extended period of low oil and gas prices. Sales this year should exceed $233 billion, and the company boasts total assets north of $263 billion. BP's bonds are investment grade, and there's always the chance that energy commodity prices will rally.Bottom Line on BP StockFor the price of BP stock to rally from current levels, the sooner cash flow breaks even, the better. There could also be positive developments on the Deepwater Horizon front, including additional settlements or reductions in future payments.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Should Keep an Eye on Tesla Inc (TSLA)Of course, if oil prices do rally above $60, BP stock will move upward in sympathy. Few strategists expect this to happen any time soon, but very few predicted oil would drop precipitously from $100 in late 2014 and bottom out at close to $30 per barrel in early 2016.A basket approach, or investing in a handful of the largest energy players in the world, makes sense in today's environment. Exxon still has a reputation as one of the best capital allocators. BP is also up there, and though its oil spill liabilities remain a huge headache, it still has the financial strength to support one of the highest dividend yields in the industry.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBoeing Co (BA) Stock Is Soaring on Trump's CoattailsTarget Corporation (TGT) Stock Is Even Worse Than Q4 Earnings Suggest7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedThe postBP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Ride Out Low Oil Prices, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Boeing Co (BA) Stock Is Soaring on Trump’s Coattails;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince the November election,Boeing Co(NYSE:BA) is up 26%. The earnings don't justify the bullishness in BA stock. The December quarter numbers, released Jan. 25, showed less revenue than in the previous quarter, and lower earnings, mainly because military orders were down.makeArticleAd();Source:WikimediaFinancial analysts may claim that a 30% hike in Boeing's dividend and an increase in the company's stock buyback program,announced in December, justify a much higher price for Boeing stock. Bulls will also point to a rosy outlook from CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who expects earnings of approximately $9.30 per share this year, a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19, close to that of the market.But, the timing of the march in BA stock - it is up 10% since those earnings came out - point to a different cause for its rise: Donald Trump.Trump's Favorite ManufacturerMuilenburg and Trump have developed something of a bromance since January. Muilenburg hasechoed the Trump line on tax reform, and Trump has put his thumb on the scale for Boeing's F/A 18 Hornet fighter jet.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightTrump also attended the roll-out of Boeing's latest commercial jet, which the company considered a very big deal. It seems ""Trumponomics"" will make or break Boeing.Boeing is also in line with Trump foreign policy.As Trump turns to India, a counterweight to Chinese power in Asia, Boeing is dramatically increasing its activity there, creating a new defense business unit, hinting at an acquisition spree,integrating with that country's supply chain.Trump likes England post-Brexit, soBoeing likes England post-Brexit. Trump likes South Carolina,Boeing loves South Carolina.Presidents serve four-year terms, and getting in line with each new President's priorities makes sense for any military contractor. BA Stock just represents an extreme case.Do the Numbers Add Up?There are financial arguments to be made both ways on Boeing, which is whyInvestorPlace'sSam Collins recently called BA stock his ""trade of the day""while Vince Martin wrote, just one week earlier, thatthe Boeing stock rally was out of gas.Boeing's asset base has fallen in recent years, from nearly $95 billion to less than $90 billion, while the long-term debt load on those assets has increased by nearly $1 billion. Boeing's revenue peaked in 2015, falling last year by approximately $500 million, with earnings per share rising only because buybacks cut the float from 695 million shares to 642.8 million.But, you don't buy or sell stocks based on yesterday - you buy or sell them based on tomorrow. You can argue that tomorrow looks very good for Boeing stock, with increased nationalism leading to more military orders, the increased efficiency of new jets leading to more domestic orders, and the increased support of the Trump Administration leading to more profit.Boeing also faces a growing, albeit competitive market in outer space, where it hopes toautomate the production of satellitesand compete with start-ups likeSpaceX, with shorter production cycles.Should You Buy BA Stock?Analysts are divided on Boeing stock, with10 calling it a buy and 9 calling it a hold, while 3 now call it a sell.My own view is that, while the upside on BA stock may be limited - even our own Sam Collins is just looking for a 10% bump to $200 from here - income investors should be very interested, as the new dividend of $1.42 per share is a 3.21% yield at current prices.Leave Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock to the SavagesWhat you think of Boeing, in other words, depends less on what you think of Trump than what you want for yourself. If you are looking for big growth, look elsewhere, but if you need retirement income, Boeing stock looks like a good bet (at least for the next four years).Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Why Tesla's Model 3 Production Plans Could Go Awry;2/28/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is gearing up to put its first true mass-market   product, the Model 3 sedan, into production. If all goes well,   the first production Model 3s will roll down a brand-new assembly   line in July.It's a huge step for the Silicon Valley automaker. The Model 3   will be produced in much higher volumes than anything that Tesla   has tried to build so far. And because it's a mass-market   product, the quality expectations will be extraordinarily   high.We know that Tesla has been spending heavily on an elaborate   revamp of its Fremont, California factory as it gears up to put   the Model 3 into production. Last week, CEO Elon Musk gave us a   look into how the company plans to ramp up its production   line.makeArticleAd();Tesla's upcoming Model 3 sedan, shown in concept form last     year. Image source: Tesla.A gradual ramp-up through the first three months of   production""I feel pretty confident that we should get there by the end   of this year, to 5,000 a week,"" Musk told analysts during Tesla's   fourth-quarter earnings call. Musk went on to outline the   production schedule that Tesla has given its parts suppliers:1,000 per week in July;2,000 per week in August;4,000 per week in September;5,000 per week by the end of the year.Keep in mind that that schedule is for parts deliveries to   Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. As Musk pointed out, it   will take time to turn those parts into finished cars as Tesla   works to get its brand-new assembly line running -- and it'll   take more time to deliver those cars to customers.The ""term-paper problem"" that could throw off the   scheduleBut even factoring in those assumptions, Musk warned that the   Model 3 ramp-up could be slowed further by what he called the   ""term-paper problem"":I was a teaching assistant in college, and no matter what     date we set the exam paper for, when the term paper was due,     it's always like there are people that are late. It's just the     way it goes. People are sometimes -- and I'm guilty of this too     -- too optimistic about the timing, or they get unlucky.Tesla has set strict delivery dates with its suppliers, but   Musk said that he knows that some number of them might well be   late. Even if it's just 1%, those late parts could throw a big   wrench into Tesla's ambitious production ramp-up schedule. Tesla   would either have to wait for the supplier to deliver the parts,   pay (a lot) extra for a rush order from another supplier, or try   to make the parts itself, in-house. Any solution other than   waiting for the original supplier risks introducing quality   concerns -- something that Teslareally can't afford with the Model 3.So does Tesla stand a chance of making its numbers?It does stand a chance of making its numbers. But it's   important to remember that there's a whole lot that can go wrong,   and some of that probably will.Like any automaker, Tesla depends on hundreds of different   suppliers for thousands of different parts. Things happen:   Sometimes, the first batches of parts for a brand-new model don't   fit exactly right. Specifications and tooling are adjusted, and   the supplier sends a better-fitting batch -- but that takes   time.The production line for Tesla's Model 3 will have much more     automation than its current lines, Musk said. Image source:     Daniel Sparks/The Motley Fool.Remember also that Tesla's production line for the Model 3   will be brand-new, and it will incorporate much more automation   than Tesla's existing line for the Model S and Model X. That   presents more opportunities for snags that might cost a day or   two here or there, all of which can add up.Most of this will probably be sorted out before Tesla   officially begins production of Model 3s for delivery to   customers. But ""most"" isn't all, and Tesla's investors -- and   customers -- will probably need to be patient as the company   works through the process.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Rio Tinto, Dillard's, Tesla and Goldman Sachs highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/28/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 28, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsRio Tinto(NYSE:RIO-Free Report)as the Bull of the DayDillard's Inc. (NYSE:DDS-Free Report)as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)andGoldman Sachs(NYSE:GS-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Rio Tinto(NYSE:RIO-Free Report)is a global industrial metal & mineral mining conglomerate headquartered in London. They employ about 55,000 people in more than 40 countries across six continents.The miner has strong presence in Australia and North America, and significant businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America. They have five product groups - Aluminum, Copper & Diamonds, Energy & Minerals, Iron Ore and Growth & Innovation.They have benefited immensely from the recent rebound in commodity prices. Additionally, the mining giant has also taken a number of measures of late to improve productivity, which have started bearing fruit now.Impressive ResultsThe miner returned to profitability last year. Earnings grew 12% in 2016, thanks mainly to the recovery in commodity prices and cost cutting. They generated strong operating cash flow of $8.5 billion and underlying earnings of $5.1 billion.Consolidated sales for 2016 were $33.8 billion, down from $34.8 billion a year ago. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower average commodity prices and reduced market premium for aluminum.Returning Capital to ShareholdersWith solid results, they announced a much higher-than-expected dividend to $1.70 per share and a $500 million of share buyback plan. During 2016, they returned $3.6 billion to shareholders, representing about 70% of underlying earnings.Rising EstimatesEstimates have surged after results, sending the stock to a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY 2017 is now $4.95 per share, up from $3.75 per share, before the results.Bear of the Day:It has been a very challenging environment for mall based retailers due to declining traffic, rising trend for online shopping and increasing competition from off-price fashion chains. Of late, concerns regarding the impact of border adjustment tax on retailers are also making investors nervous.Founded in 1938,Dillard's Inc. (NYSE:DDS-Free Report)is a large departmental store chain featuring fashion apparel, cosmetics and home furnishings. The company went public in 1969 and it currently operated about 300 stores across 29 states. Their merchandise includes both national and exclusive brands.Disappointing ResultsThe retailer reported disappointing results for Q4, with both sales and earnings missing estimates and also declining year over year.Adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share were significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34 and down about 17.8% year-over-year.""Our operating results reflect another quarter of mall traffic declines from continued retail industry challenges,"" said the CEO.Falling EstimatesAnalysts have been cutting their estimates for the company after quarterly results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next fiscal year are now $4.36 per share and $4.17 per share respectively, down from $5.00 per share and $4.77 per share respectively, before the results. Declining estimates sent the stock back to Zacks Rank # 5 last week.The company has missed Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of the last four quarters, with an average quarterly surprise of 5.4%.The Bottom LineDeclining store traffic and rising trend towards online shopping to present challenges for retailers. The Zacks industry rank for Retail-Regional Department Stores is currently 251 out of 265 (Bottom 5%).There is no Zacks Rank #1 or #2 stock in this industry as of now.More Stocks to Sell. Now.Beyond our Bear Stock of the Day, today's list of 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand even more urgent attention. If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List, they should be removed immediately. Many appear to be sound investments but, since 1988, such stocks have actually performed more than 11X worse than the S&P 500.Additional content:Here's Why Shares of Tesla (TSLA) Tumbled MondayOn Monday, shares of storied electric car makerTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)are tumbling, down around 4.5% in morning trading to $245.42 per share after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS-Free Report) downgraded the automaker's stock. Analyst David Tamberrino turned negative, cutting TSLA to Sell from Neutral and slashing his six-month price target to $185 from $190.""While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM (original-equipment market) peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs,"" Tamberrino said in a note to clients.Goldman is already expecting Tesla's launch of its low-cost, mass-market Model 3 to be delayed, despite reassurance from the company in its earnings report last week that the vehicle is on schedule to arrive in July. The firm also believes Tesla will be forced to issue $1.7 billion in shares in the upcoming third quarter to fund its capital-spending plans.The electric car maker's fourth quarter earnings were mixed, with strong revenues despite a significant net loss. It was a fairly normal report for Tesla, filled with inconsistencies and ambitious goals made by CEO Elon Musk.

(ETF)(NYSEARCA:IYT) - have rallied about 1.6% between last Friday and yesterday, Monday, Feb. 27. This might not seem like much, but it does matter when considering the fates of transport stockUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS).makeArticleAd();Yes, 1.6% isn't much in percentage terms. However, considering the relative weakness which this group of stocks exhibited versus the broader stock market, this new-found friskiness is a welcome change and could in the near-term lead to higher prices still.UPS stock, at about 6.8% currently, is the fourth largest holding of the IYT ETF. Since its late-January earnings report, UPS has badly lagged the broader group of transportation stocks as represented on the first chart.Click to EnlargeNote the steep relative underperformance since the relative strength high in the summer of 2016. While through this lens, this relative weakness still looks to be in free fall, let's also note that this ratio chart is once again reaching the relative weakness lows from March 2015 as denoted by the two orange bubbles.While this alone is a far cry from a bullish signal, let's keep this chart in mind as we work through the rest of the analysis below.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowWhen I last discussed UPS stock onNov. 8, 2016- the day prior to the U.S. election results - I offered that the stock looked promising for a rally once we got the initial post-election price reaction out of the way. Sure enough, the stock held up after the election results and hit my price target (in the $115-$116 range) a few short weeks later.UPS Stock ChartsLooking at the multiyear weekly chart, we see that after topping out in mid-December, UPS stock began a corrective phase that measured nearly 15% at the Jan. 31 lows following the earnings report.Click to EnlargeOn this chart, we see that the area around $104-$105 (the January lows) matches up with horizontal support, as represented by the blue box and the 100-week simple moving average (also blue).On the daily chart, we see that these January lows - which on Friday, Feb. 24, received a marginal retest - also lined up with the black diagonal line of former resistance that could now turn into support.Click to EnlargeFrom a momentum perspective, note that the MACD oscillator in recent weeks became very oversold and is now showing signs of potential recovery.Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back NorthLastly, on Monday, Feb. 27, my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator flashed a swing trading buy signal as represented  by the green up-arrow.

Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back North;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) initially rose after hours following an earnings report that raised as many questions as it answered. However, TSLA stock then succumbed to selling pressures and ultimately fell some 7% across the week.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)AGoldman Sachs downgradeyesterday added another 5% to the recent slide to close at $246.23, with shares of Tesla stock now 12% off the recent highs at the $280 level.With the faith in TSLA stock now broken, the $235 level looms as an important area to hold.Certainly the ongoing questions surrounding Tesla continue to remain unanswered. The most pertinent question involves the likelihood of an additional capital raise for Tesla, especially on the heels of theSolarCityacquisition and the ever alarming free cash flow burn rate. While TSLA appears to have more than adequate liquidity in the short-term, eventually, a dilutive secondary offering appears to be almost virtually certain.Tesla also faces uncertainty surrounding the critical Model 3 launch. Yes, Tesla management is fully confident of their projections … but many analysts are expressing doubts. Certainly, TSLA's past history of Tesla - over-promising and under-delivering - likely weighed on analyst opinion. James Brumley does a superb job ofdrilling down deeplyon some of these very notions.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowWhile faith in Tesla may be difficult to gauge, it is not all that difficult to see from a technical perspective.Tesla Stock ChartsIn my most recent post on TSLA stock, I pointed to an over-abundance of faith in the company at the $270 level and suggested a short-term bearish trade, which proved to be prescient. With shares now approaching the $235 support level, my view on Tesla is decidedly less bearish.Why? Because pricedoesmatter.Click to EnlargeUsing a somewhat simplistic 9-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) methodology has proven to be quite effective in identifying short-term tops and bottoms in Tesla stock.

(AMD) Stock Is Going to Stumble SoonSo while I'm decidedly not a Tesla bull for a long-term investment, as a trader, I've switched to a more bullish short-term posture given the recent drubbing in shares.

The maximum gain is $50 per spread with maximum risk of $200 per spread. Return on risk is 25%.The short $230 strike provides a 6.5% downside cushion to the $246.23 closing price of Tesla shares and is also well below the $235 support level.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock or Twilio Inc (TWLO): Which Is a Better Buy?The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postPlay Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Before It Swings Back Northappeared first onInvestorPlace."

It's Official: These Are the 3 Most Ludicrously Overvalued Stocks on the Market;2/28/2017;"The stock market is, for lack of a better word, imperfect.   While we as investors would love for things to be entirely   rational (for example, earnings growth translating into orderly   stock-buying and the subsequent appreciation of stock   valuations), that's not always what happens.A number of factors, including emotions and even X factors   that can't be foreseen ahead of time, can influence stock   valuations. Sometimes these ancillary factors can push stock   valuations exceptionally low, which presents an intriguing buying   opportunity for Wall Street and investors. On the other side of   the coin, emotions and X factors can also push stock valuations   into the stratosphere, well beyond the point where any rational   fundamental theorist would dare go. At any given time, there are   almost always going to be a few stocks that fall into the latter   category of being ludicrously overvalued.Three companies that'll have fundamental investors saying     ""No thanks!"" Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Though valuation is an entirely arbitrary process for each   investor, the following three companies stand out for their   frightening valuations compared to what they bring to the   table.Tesla Inc.It may not be a popular opinion, but one stock I'd crown as   overvalued -- ludicrously so -- is electric-vehicle and   solar-panel-installation companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .What I will give Tesla is this: It's the first car company in   decades to really build itself from the ground up and disrupt   Detroit's big three automakers. The demand for Tesla's Model S   and X, as well as initial orders for its cheaper Model 3 sedan,   have been phenomenal and demonstrate the desire of Americans to   own cleaner vehicles.But what looks to be a good idea on paper has yet to translate   into profits. Just days ago Tesla reported a 79% increase in   automotive fourth-quarter revenue, but it still delivered an   adjusted net loss of $106.6 million. Sure, that was a 60%   narrower adjusted net loss from the prior-year quarter, but it's   still a loss. In fact, the company burned through more than $448   million in cash flow during Q4 as it continued to ramp up the   Gigafactory in preparation for the Model 3. Tesla ended the year   with $3.39 billion in cash and cash equivalents, but has plans to   spend $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2017.   In other words, yet another cash raise may be in order.The Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla Inc.Tesla's solar business -- it acquired SolarCity less than two   months ago -- also languished. Tesla reported 201 MW of solar   installation in Q4, which was almost 100 MW lower than what   SolarCity had previously guided for. It's no secret that solar   has been weak, but these figures are exceptionally weak.A simple comparison ofGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) and Tesla really shows how out in left field Tesla's   valuation is at the moment. In 2016, General Motors sold nearly   10 million vehicles and generated nearly $9.12 billion in profit.   In fact, it's currently valued at roughly six times its trailing   12-month earnings. By comparison, Tesla produced only around   90,000 vehicles and is losing money hand over fist, and its $41   billion valuation implies a market value of almost $500,000 per   car! GM's $56 billion valuation and annual production of 10   million implies a valuation of approximately $5,600 per car   produced. That difference is insane. Even with the two companies   having very different business models, I don't see why any   fundamental investors in their right minds would choose Tesla   over GM.Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.Just because a stock has a small-cap valuation doesn't mean it   can't still be ludicrously overvalued. Next on the list is highly   volatile developmental-stage mining companyNorthern Dynasty Minerals(NYSEMKT: NAK) .In recent months, Northern Dynasty Minerals' shares have   caught fire with the expectation that the Trump administration   would ease rules set in place by the Environment Protection   Agency, possibly allowing the company to be permitted for the   Pebble Project in Alaska. In theory, Pebble has enough assets in   the ground to keep a mining company busy for upwards of 100   years. Gold andsilver   pricesare also up nicely over the past two months.Image source: Getty Images.Unfortunately, Northern Dynasty's dream of development seems   to be more of a fairy tale. One of the bigger issues with Pebble   is that the inferred assets in the ground are spread out. While   abundant, many of these assets just haven't appeared to be   economically feasible to recover. What's more, Northern Dynasty   has already spent hundreds of millions just to get to the point   where it's trying to determine if there are economically viable   areas to mine in Pebble. Don't believe me? Here's a direct   statement from the company's third-quarter report:The Group's continuing operations and underlying value and     recoverability of the amount shown for the Group's mineral     property interests, is entirely dependent upon the existence of     economically recoverable mineral reserves.Making matters worse, Northern Dynasty Minerals has nowhere   near the capitalization required to develop Pebble into a   commercially viable operation (assuming recovery is even   economically feasible). At the end of the third quarter, the   company had less than $6 million in cash and cash equivalents   left, although it did generate more than $32 million from a   secondary offering in January 2017. Even so, this is laughably   far off from the years and billions of dollars it would seemingly   take to get Pebble up to commercial production.Having been previously abandoned before by companies with   pocketbooks that were far deeper than Northern Dynasty Minerals',   Pebble is likely a dead duck, and Northern Dynasty's stock is   potentially worthless.Snap Inc.Finally, even though it's not even officially public yet,   Snapchat parentSnap Inc.(NYSE: SNAP) gets my vote for being ludicrously overvalued.On one hand, I can understand the allure of a company like   Snap considering how wellFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) has performed since it went public. In just three   years, Snap has essentially tripled its daily active users from   around 50 million to 158 million, and with the somewhat recent   addition of advertising revenue, Snap's top line is surging. It   generated $404.5 million in sales in 2016 after just $58 million   in revenue in 2015. If Snap can use innovative new ad-targeting   tools to reach a rapidly growing number of users, itcouldbe Facebook 2.0, or so some pundits suggest.Image source: Snap Inc.However, as has been the theme here, I'd like to disagree.   Snap's expected IPO price range, according to the company, values   it as aggressively as $22 billion. At $22 billion, Snap is being   valued at 54.4 times its total sales. I'm going to go ahead and   repeat that for you who are skimming. That's 54 (fifty-four!) times sales. By comparison, Facebook andTwitterare currently valued at 14.2 and 4.5 times sales,   respectively.What's more, companies like Facebook have alternative revenue   channels. Snap only began generating revenue from advertising two   years ago, so it's entirely reliant on ads to generate its   sales.Of course, the coup de grace for Snap is that in spite of   $404.5 million in sales, it wound up losing $514.6 million in   2016. This harks back to the dot-com bubble days, when companies   simply spent every ounce of capital they had and assumed the   economy and internet growth would buffer their risk-taking. At   some point Wall Street is going to again shun companies that   can't turn a profit (ahem, Tesla!), and I certainly wouldn't want   any part of Snap when that day comes.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Big Factor That Will Help Tesla's Model 3 Launch;2/27/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is gearing up for maybe its biggest moment yet:   the start of production of its first true mass-market model, the   Model 3.It's a moment that is fraught with challenges. The Model 3 is   all-new and different from earlier Teslas, and it's going to be   built on an all-new assembly line that incorporates much more   automation than anything Tesla has tried to date.A lot rides on Tesla's ability todeliver high-quality Model 3s, and there are a lot of things that could go wrong. But as CEO   Elon Musk explained during Tesla's earnings call last week, Tesla   has an important new factor working in its favor: its   suppliers.makeArticleAd();Tesla's upcoming Model 3 sedan, shown in concept form last     year. Image source: Tesla.Tesla is reaping the benefits of its growth with   suppliersAll automakers, big or small, are heavily dependent on   suppliers. In particular, suppliers that specialize in certain   types of parts -- whether circuit boards or seats -- can produce   parts to a higher level of quality much less expensively than an   automaker could do on its own.Musk said that in Tesla's early days, it was hard to get the   attention of the established auto-industry suppliers. Those   suppliers are used to thinking in terms of production runs that   will go into six or seven figures of volume -- and few in the   auto industry thought Tesla's Model S would end up selling in the   tens of thousands every year.But now that Tesla has proven that it can (and will) build and   sell cars in volume, the suppliers are much more interested in   winning its business. Musk explained:We're able to get usually the A team at the A supplier for     Model 3. It's rare that we're not able to get that. Whereas,     particularly for Model S and to some degree for Model X, when     we were trying to get suppliers for Model S, a lot of the     top-tier suppliers wouldn't even work with us. They didn't     believe in the car. They thought we'd go bankrupt.Having shown the results of the Model S and the Model X, the     interest from suppliers went from basically getting like the     worst team on second-tier suppliers to getting the best team on     first-tier suppliers. It's really a big difference.It should make a huge difference in some of the details of the   finished product. Think of things like the fit and finish of   interior panels, or the comfort of the seats, or the quality of   the glass used in the windshield. These are all things that drew   some criticism in the earlier Teslas, and they're all things that   can be improved by having the A-list suppliers giving their best   efforts.If the Model 3's launch is smooth, suppliers will be a big   reasonThere's a lot -- awholelot -- that can go wrong with Tesla's ramp-up to full production   of the Model S. Some things will go wrong: A few suppliers will   be late, a few early batches of parts won't fit properly, a robot   or tool on Tesla's brand-new production line won't work as   designed.These things happen to all automakers. They're more likely to   happen to Tesla with the Model 3, simply because this is the   company's first-ever attempt at a high-volume production car.Analysts have looked to the problem-plagued launch of Tesla's   Model X for clues as to how the Model 3 launch might unfold (and   have downgraded their near-term expectations accordingly). But   the fact that Tesla has been able to significantly upgrade its   relationships with suppliers since the X's launch might make that   a misleading comparison.Long story short: I think the Model 3 launch could go more   smoothly than many expect. If so, suppliers will be a big reason   why.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Tesla, AmTrust Financial Services, and Horizon Pharma Slumped Today;2/27/2017;"The stock market kept performing well on Monday, and theDow Jones Industrialsposted its 12th straight all-time record high. Market sentiment   was sunny following the release of Warren Buffett's annual   shareholder letter over the weekend, and the Oracle of Omaha made   positive comments about the sustainability of the current bull   market, which was able to overcome early declines in the major   market benchmarks. However, some stocks didn't fare as well as   the overall market, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,AmTrust Financial Services(NASDAQ: AFSI) , andHorizon Pharma(NASDAQ: HZNP) were among the worst performers on the day. Below,   we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did   so poorly.Tesla gets a poor reviewShares of Tesla fell 4% after the electric car manufacturer   received a downgrade from analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Wall   Street giant cut its rating on Tesla from neutral to sell, citing   concerns about the company's ability to launch its Model 3   mass-market sedan, execute on the strategy behind its acquisition   of solar specialist SolarCity, and deal with the need to tap the   capital markets to raise cash. Yet even the bearish analysts   admit that Tesla has a competitive advantage over rival   automakers with respect to the technology and architecture of its   electric vehicles, and Tesla's efforts to boost battery   production appear to be working. Nevertheless, the question   facing investors is whether Tesla can execute well on the huge   opportunity it has in front of it, and at least in Goldman's   eyes, that could prove more difficult than initially thought.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();AmTrust deals with a potential problemAmTrust Financial Services' stock plunged 19% in the wake of   the company's fourth-quarter financial report. The insurance   provider said that results for the quarter looked solid, with   substantial rises in premium volume and service and fee income,   as well as a pickup in net income of nearly two-thirds compared   to the year-ago quarter. However, investors appeared nervous   about AmTrust's comments about the timing of its annual report   filing, which included a statement that the company expects to   disclose ""material weaknesses in in its internal control over   financial reporting"" that existed as of the end of 2016. Until   AmTrust reveals exactly how material the impacts might be and how   it expects to fix them going forward, shareholders are likely to   remain cautious.Horizon disappoints investorsFinally, shares of Horizon Pharma fell 6%. The   biopharmaceutical company said that sales were up 27% from   year-ago levels, but it posted a net loss of $130.5 million. Even   after adjusting for various extraordinary items, Horizon's   bottom-line growth was limited to less than 1%, resulting in flat   adjusted earnings per share from the year-earlier period. Yet   even expectations of 19% to 23% top-line growth in 2017 with 12%   to 22% increases in pre-tax operating profit weren't enough to   satisfy shareholders. Nevertheless, Horizon CEO Tim Walbert   remained optimistic, noting that ""continued commercial execution   and the completion of two transformative acquisitions [will]   bolster our rapidly expanding rare disease business.""Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

NVDA stock, which soared a massive 55.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, has been a popular momentum play because of its exposure to exciting and fast-growing areas such as machine learning, virtual reality/augmented reality and autonomous transportation.makeArticleAd();But after reporting better-than-expected results on both its top and bottom lines, as well solid forward guidance, investors had a powerful sell-the-news response in Nvidia stock. Shares pushed below their 50-day moving average for the first time in more than a year.What should investors watch for in NVDA stock now?Looking back at its results, the growth is undeniable: Revenues surged nearly 55% from the year prior thanks to a 66.4% jump in gaming sales to $1.35 billion, responsible for about two-thirds of the company's overall take. The auto segment, which specializes in self-driving systems used byTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) and others, saw revenue grow 37.6% to $128 million.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowBut, if you look hard, there are early signs that expectations could cool. You can see it in the OEM & IP segment, where revenue fell 11.1% to $176 million last quarter. This could be a sign of a slowdown in graphics card sales after the very successful launch of the GTX 1000 series in 2016.Needham analysts believe gaming revenue growth will slow to an 11% annual rate. Stifel is worried that both seasonality and a high revenue base will also limit gaming revenue growth going forward. Valuations have been a concern as well, resulting in a downgrade of NVDA stock at BMO Capital Markets.Technically, double-top resistance near $120 will be difficult to overcome despite Goldman Sachsdefending the stockand suggesting a buy-the-weakness approach.Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of theEdgeandEdge Proinvestment advisory newsletters.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is Going to Stumble Soon;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rebound inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is one heck of a story. Just one year ago the stock was trading below $2 and appeared to be on the brink of extinction. Then, suddenly, it turned itself around. Now AMD stock has powered through $15 for the first time since 2007.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrThis sort of parabolic momentum was commonplace for tech companies back in the late 1990s - AMD experienced similar spikes in 1999-2000 and 2003-05, each followed by a crash in the years ahead - but this is a very rare occurrence in today's environment.AMD stock is up more than 600% in the last year, with new products primarily driving the growth. However, you also have to keep fundamentals in mind, and I believe there is reason to be cautious here.While Advanced Micro Devices is set to once againreport positive earnings in 2017 and even more robust growth in the coming years, there's no question that AMD stock is overvalued.Looking ahead to 2020, the 20 analysts currently covering this stock anticipate earnings will grow to 60 cents per share. A 25X multiple on that expectation would put AMD at $15, which isn't far from where it's trading today. And based on 2017 EPS expectations of 6 cents, the shares currently boast a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 237.AMD Stock ChartsSpeaking from a pure technical standpoint, AMD has been one of the best stocks in the market over the last year with its methodical series of higher highs and higher lows.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowHowever, today the stock is overbought and due for a near-term pullback.If the trend were to continue, AMD stock would pull back and successfully test support around $12.60. On the other hand, a break below that level would compromise the uptrend.As a result, I wouldn't be a buyer at current levels.But if we do see some near-term weakness and a bounce off $12.60, AMD could be a buy around $13 for a purely technical swing trade.Matthew McCall is founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm.

Why Does Honda's Electric Car Have Just 80 Miles of Range?;2/27/2017;"The upcoming battery-electric Clarity sedan fromHonda(NYSE: HMC) will come with a big surprise, according to a new   report: a range of just 80 miles.That's the word from trade publicationAutomotive Newsin a report that was more or less confirmed by Honda   officials.That seems woefully inadequate by 2017 standards. What is   Honda thinking?makeArticleAd();The upcoming Honda Clarity Electric is expected to look very     similar to the 2017 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell sedan released late     last year. Image source: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.Why such a short range?At an expected starting price of around $35,000, the Clarity   Electric will be in direct competition (in terms of price, at   least) withGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt EV andTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) upcoming Model 3 sedan. But the Bolt has an   EPA-rated range of 238 miles, and the Model 3's range is expected   to be in the same ballpark. Why didn't the Clarity's range at   least come close to its rivals?Honda executives told Automotive News that the Clarity   Electric's short range was a byproduct of the company's decision   to base it on the platform of the midsize Clarity Fuel Cell,introduced last year. The Clarity Fuel Cell is a midsize sedan, about the size of   Honda's Accord. It's considerably bigger than the Bolt.The size and design of the Clarity platform, which will also   be shared with a plug-in hybrid version, didn't leave room   (physically or financially) for a larger, longer-range battery   pack without a hefty cost increase, they said.Why Honda committed to a three-Clarity strategyHonda explained last year that the idea behind theClarity's three-drivetrain strategyis that it will give Honda flexibility to vary the production mix   as the market and infrastructure evolves. It also allows Honda's   customers to choose their preferred path to an ""ultra-low carbon   vehicle that meets their lifestyle needs,"" in Honda's words.I think the business decision flow probably looked like   this:After years of building tiny numbers of fuel-cell vehicles     for test markets, Hondawantedto do a fuel-cell car that could be marketed to a somewhat     wider audience.Under pressure from investors (and maybe its dealers),     Honda felt itneededto offer a midsize battery-electric car -- if only to show that     it could be competitive in that realm.Honda thendecidedto add a plug-in hybrid version that was likely to sell in much     greater numbers than either of the other versions, in order to     give the Clarity a better chance of turning a profit.The problem is, when you design one car around three very   different drivetrains, a lot of compromises have to be made. And   the Clarity Electric's rivals are much less compromised   designs.The cost of compromising on a battery-electric carTesla has shown the world what can be done when a car is   designed from the ground up around a battery-electric drivetrain.   A vehicle designed from the start around electric motors and a   big battery pack can have plenty of range, good handling, a roomy   interior, and lots of cargo space.The Chevy Bolt doesn't look like a Tesla, but like the Teslas,   it was designed from the start as a battery-electric vehicle. It   doesn't have the range or speed of the big Teslas, but it has   something else enabled by its battery-electric packaging: A   surprisingly roomy interior enclosed in a small, nimble vehicle   perfect for city driving.It's no coincidence that the Teslas and the Bolt are the   current gold standard of battery-electric vehicles. And it's sad   that Honda, which has spent years building up its green-car   credibility, has settled for a compromised design with the   Clarity Electric.But will it sell?Some folks say range doesn't matter all that much, and the   Clarity Electric will find buyers attracted to its size and   Honda's reputation for quality and durability. I'm skeptical: I   think the plug-in hybrid version of the Clarity -- or an Accord   Hybrid -- is likely to win over most of the green-minded Honda   loyalists who might have taken a chance on a Clarity Electric   with greater range.It's likely Honda will share more details about the Clarity   Electric at the New York International Auto Show in April.

Get Paid to Trade International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have not been a fan ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) for a long time. It is my opinion that management was slow to shift cash cows. They lost their way and have yet to recover. They have been trying to carve a niche in artificial intelligence, but that story has been over a decade in the making. To use a poker term, they are pot-committed to AI.makeArticleAd();Luckily, artificial intelligence has seen a recent resurgence in popularity so the wait may actually pay off to IBM longs.Experts are in awe of what Watson can do. Unfortunately, its profit stream is taking too long to develop. IBM is no longer the sure long-term bet it once was. To me, it more resembles a startup with a cool product still finding its way.Click to EnlargeUsually, I like to sell longer-dated risk in companies that I believe are long-term winners likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) orApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). In this case, I am putting my trust in the IBM price action more so than its fundamentals.The Bet:Sell the IBM Oct $130 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.40 per contract to open. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. This sounds like a great idea now, but it comes with risk. By selling the put naked, I am committing to buying the stock at $130 per share if IBM falls below it. Anything below $128.60 per share would accrue losses for me.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsSelling naked puts is not suited for most investors, so I can modify the trade to make it more attainable.The Alternate:Sell IBM $140/$135 credit put spread. This also is a bullish trade, but one with a finite risk profile. I collect 40 cents per contract to open. The 22% price buffer is smaller than that of selling the $130 naked put but for the finite risk profile advantage.While 40 cents may sound too little, it would represent an 8% yield on money risked and for the high chance of success it carries it should elate most investors.I chose longer-dated risk so I don't have to fret the short-term gyrations. I find that longer-dated options risk is easier to manage. Also, I can close either of these trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Should Keep an Eye on Tesla Inc (TSLA);2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) stock is down 9.65% year to date; the company has had a rough start to 2017. First, a $2 billion asset impairment charge on gas assets in the Rocky Mountains clouded XOM's fourth-quarter earnings call on Jan. 31.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Then, on Feb. 22 , XOM announced that it had to write off 3.3 billion barrels of oil in reserves at the end of 2016. With oil prices in the mid $50s, getting oil from some of XOM's Canadian oil sands is no longer profitable.This represents a massive destruction of value for holders of Exxon stock. A decade ago, XOM invested approximately  $20 billion in these Canadian oil sands amid concern over peak oil. Unless oil prices rise, those billions will have been wasted.There could be more such downside surprises in store for Exxon as well. Further developments in clean energy could wipe billions more off the balance sheets of oil companies like XOM.XOM's Rosy View of Oil's FutureUnlikeRoyal Dutch Shell plc (ADR)(NYSE:RDS.A), whose CFO said thatoil demand could peak as soon as 2020, XOM expects oil to dominate past the year 2040 .The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsMcKinsey & Co. expects oil demand topeak by 2030, with electric vehicles representing 30% of new vehicles sold that year. XOM, on the other hand, doesn't see electric vehicles passing 10% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. until 2040 .Could XOM be underestimating the threat of electric cars and alternative energy? A new study by the Carbon Tracker Initiative and Imperial College London suggests that the answer could be yes. This study found that the adoption of electric vehicles could displace2 million barrels of oil per dayin demand by 2025.Oil companies like XOM may be doing straight line extrapolations when the adoption of new technologiesactually follows an S-curve. Initially, progress is slow for many years, as only a few adopt a new technology. Eventually, however, usage of the technology jumps and it goes mainstream before growth tapers off.Advancements in battery technology may be reducing use of gasoline, another form of energy storage. Recently, gasoline consumption in the U.S. plummeted and the country experienced theworst gasoline glut since 1990.Is this temporary, or could this be a sign of oil demand peaking?Tesla's Threat to Oil Companies Like XOMWith its recent acquisition of SolarCity,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is on its way to becoming an alternative energy powerhouse. Tesla brings solar, electric vehicles and energy storage together under one roof (pun intended). TSLA wants to beginsolar roof installationslater this year.Renewable energy depends on energy storage technology in order to compete with fossil fuels. Fossil fuels can be burned day and night, while the sun doesn't shine at night. Some of the energy captured during the day must be stored for nighttime use.For renewables to replace fossil fuels in transportation (28% of energy usein the U.S.), batteries must replace gasoline as the method of storing energy in a car.  With cheaper batteries, we can expect greater investments in renewable energy.Further, global energy storage is set to take off. Bloomberg New Energy Finance expects global energy storage capacity toincrease by a factor of 15by 2024. Developing countries can expect even larger increases; the World Bank Group predicted a40-fold growth in energy storage capacityby 2025.Catch Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock While It's Under PressureBattery costs have declined 40% since 2014, and this will continue. In January, Tesla opened its $5 billiongigafactory, which will double the world's production capacity of lithium-ion batteries. Costs are sure to come down as TSLA scales up.And, Tesla isn't finished, yet; CEO Elon Musk wants to open up three more such gigafactories.Tesla's newPowerpack battery, revealed in October, packs twice the power capacity of the original, and Musk thinks TSLA can meet its goal of selling  500,000 electric cars per year as early as 2018.Clean energy could be nearing an inflection point, with dire implications for oil companies like XOM.Mitigating FactorsLow energy prices, like we are seeing now, could have a silver lining for oil companies - and for XOM stock. While low oil prices will reduce XOM's profitability, they also will ensure steady demand growth and slow the adoption of new energy-saving technologies. Musk said last year that cheap oil would be bad for EV makers like Tesla.Also, oil companies may now have a friend in the White House. President Donald Trump seems skeptical of climate change and more comfortable with smokestack industries than Barack Obama. And, Trump picked Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, which couldbenefit XOM stockas well.As of this writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right Now7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashWarren Buffett Still Loves Bank of America Corp (BAC) StockThe postExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Should Keep an Eye on Tesla Inc (TSLA)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Analyst David Tamberrino turned negative, cutting TSLA to Sell from Neutral and slashing his six-month price target to $185 from $190.""While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM (original-equipment market) peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs,"" Tamberrino said in a note to clients.Goldman is already expecting Tesla's launch of its low-cost, mass-market Model 3 to be delayed, despite reassurance from the company in its earnings report last week that the vehicle is on schedule to arrive in July. The firm also believes Tesla will be forced to issue $1.7 billion in shares in the upcoming third quarter to fund its capital-spending plans.The electric car maker's fourth quarter earnings were mixed, with strong revenues despite a significant net loss.

Warren Buffett Still Loves Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) have risen as much as 10% since I last issuedmy buy recommendationon Jan. 24, during which I predicted BAC stock will reach $28 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 25% returns.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrNow, though, it's possible that target might be underestimating Bank of America's real potential.As of Friday's close, BAC stock has improved by about 10% year-to-date, fueling most of a 16% run over the past three months. On Saturday, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, CEO ofBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), applauded Bank of America's decision to buy back stock:""Many of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite aggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.)""When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.""According toBuffett's letter, Berkshire owns $5 billion of preferred Bank of America stock, which pays Berkshire $300 million annually. The ownership stake also carries a warrant that expires Sept. 2, 2021, which grants Berkshire the right to buy 700 million BAC common shares for $5 billion. According to Buffett's letter, the ability to exercise the warrant could net Berkshire a profit of $10.5 billion at the end of this year.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingAnd Buffett says Berkshire could easily pay the $5 billion for the 700 million BAC common shares by using its preferred shares. As such, it would make perfect sense to exercise the warrant, especially given the dividend Berkshire collects.In that regard, Buffett noted that Bank of America's annual dividend, currently at 30 cents, could rise some 50% before 2021 (when the warrant expires), topping 44 cents per share.Bottom Line for BAC StockAll told, Warren Buffett and Berkshire are in a win-win situation. What's more, from a valuation perspective, BAC stock - which is priced less-than 12 times fiscal 2018 estimates of 1$2.09 per share - still looks like a bargain compared to peersJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) andWells Fargo & Company(NYSE:WFC).Combined with Bank of America's cost-cutting strategy and measures to grow revenue on the back of higher interest rates, BAC stock looks like a no-brainer among financials.That's something Buffett - who said ""undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions"" - hinted at in his letter.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCatch Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock While It's Under PressureThe 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThe postWarren Buffett Still Loves Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Its users can put money in Yuebao, a money market fund, and invest inZhao Cai Bao, where they can loan money directly to businesses.Paytm's Threat to BanksBanks in both countries are threatened by this disruption. Ant's Yuebao offers depositors higher interest rates than banks andinstant withdrawals. Technology companies don't have to maintain as many employees at branches as banks do, and can link borrowers and savers directly. Their asset-light model is simply more efficient than that of existing banks, which have to use their own capital, and are burdened by legacy systems and regulation.Banks earn a profit on the spread, the difference between the rate at which they lend and the rates they offer depositors. Platforms that connect borrowers and lenders and cut out the middleman can exert pressure on this. And because Paytm and Ant Financial are branchless, they have lower overhead costs, and can offer lower fees than banks.Paytm will be both a friend and a potential enemy to banks. It will help them drum up business by cross-selling their services to its users. But Paytm will probably be the front-end in customer interactions and relegate the banks to the back end .Banks risk becoming ""dumb pipes."" As I mentioned inmy articlelast year, the front-end generally gives banks a higher return on equity than the back. AMcKinsey & Companystudy found that banks earn a 22% return on equity from sales and origination, but only 6% from the extension of credit.Protectionism RisksAll of this doesn't mean that the success of Alibaba, Ant and Paytm is guaranteed. Some risks still stand in the way.First, protectionist sentiment is rising in India asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andUberclobber their Indian rivals. Indian startups such as Flipkart, Snapdeal (in which BABA is an investor), and Ola have had their valuations repeatedly marked down over the past year. Now some are asking for protection against supposedly unfair foreign competition. Indian venture capitalist Vani Kola of Kalaari Capital called for such measures, followed bysimilar sentimentfrom the founders of e-commerce player Flipkart and Ola, viewed as India's home-grown Uber) .Since Paytm is an Indian company, why would this be a concern? While Paytm is Indian, its largest shareholders are Chinese, Alibaba and Ant. Would India want such a company controlling something as critical as its payments infrastructure? Experts have raised concerns overPaytm user dataending up in servers outside of India.Pointing to Paytm's Chinese ties, the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee accused the prime minister ofcompromising national security. The Sino-Indian relationship is contentious; the two countries went to war as recently as 1962 over a border dispute.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Q4 Earnings: What to ExpectFor Paytm to work, users must see it as secure and reliable. Without trust, Paytm cannot succeed. However, in December the Paytm server was down for an hour, leaving users unable to make payments.Paytm's customer service also is a weak spot, with many rating it as bad. Also, the recent user increase may be temporary. After March 13, Paytm may lose as much as 30% of its offline customers once cash withdrawal limits end.Bottom Line on Alibaba StockEven if Paytm and BABA succeed, however, buying Alibaba stock is notwithout risks.Alibaba is a variable interest entity, which means American shareholders own shares in a Cayman Islands-based entity. Chinese law forbids foreign ownership in Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, so this structure is a way around it.But the Chinese government's position isn't clear, and it could always change its mind, at the expense of BABA stock holders.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 Surprise7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedThe postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate Indiaappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Ever;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLost in the collapse ofUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UA) stock over the past year is an odd divergence between two classes of stock. Shares of UAA stock (Class A) have traded at a substantial premium to UA stock (Class C). The difference is about 10% at the moment, in fact.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat gap makes little sense. Class C UA stock has no voting rights. Class A UAA stock does have voting rights of one vote per share. But those rights don't have much value. CEO and founder Kevin Plank owns all of the non-trading Class B shares, which have 10 votes each, giving Plank 65% of the voting power as of December 2016.UAA shareholders are paying a premium for votes which are largely symbolic. And it's not as if other considerations justify that gap. The market is figuring out the divergence, as the 10% premium has narrowed of late. But there's still time for easy profits in shorting UAA and going long UA.As for investors bullish on Under Armour, there's basically no reason to pay up for the UAA stock.No, UAA Stock Isn't Worth More Than UA StockAs seen in the chart below, the gap between UA and UAA has narrowed of late, after peaking in November.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAt one point in late November - less than a year after the Class C UA stock was issued - the gap was over 20%, a huge number. In dollars, the difference has dropped to near $2 per share from as high as $7 - but some of that compression has come from the fact that Under Armour stock has declined precipitously after two disappointing earnings reports.With the largely symbolic voting rights not likely to change anytime soon, there's simply very little reason for UA to trade above UAA.According to theregistration statementfiled by Under Armour with the SEC, Class C holders of Under Armour stock are entitled to the same dividends. The only way for Class A shareholders to gain some sort of majority voting power would be for Plank to be terminated for cause or to give up his shares.Neither outcome seems particularly likely given that the CEO is 42 years old, intensely competitive, and intent on turning around his beloved Under Armour himself.Liquidity doesn't justify the different prices for Under Armour stock, either, with one possible exception.There was a notable divergence in equity volume a few months ago. UA stock had an average volume under 1 million shares per day in October, roughly 20% of UAA stock. But volume over the past month is almost equal: 6.5 million shares a day for UA and 6.9 million for UAA. The increase in UA volume probably has something to do with the narrowing premium and implies that the spread will continue to tighten.How To Play Under Armour StockThere is one notable difference between UA and UAA: options volume. For instance, open interest in the UA Jan 2018 $20 puts is just over 400. In contrast, there are more than 11,000 UAA Jan 2018 $20 calls open at the moment.That difference is not enough to justify a 10% premium, however, particularly for smaller investors. And it seems the market is figuring that out. But the gap remains wide enough that there's still room to make what should be close to risk-free profits by going long UA and short UAA.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA): Amazing Company, Not-So-Good Stock ... For NowAny major event - like an acquisition, as unlikely as that seems at the moment - will treat shareholders equally. Any dividend payments will be the same. The only difference between UA and UAA is the opportunity to vote even though those votes have no practical impact.So an arbitrage trade still looks like it has some upside. Voting rights between classes at other stocks usually are below 5%, meaning a long UA/short UAA trade could make another $1 per share with very low risk.For investors who still think Under Armour stock is a better opportunity, then Class C UA stock is the right choice. The premium for UAA stock simply doesn't make a lot of sense - and it's still wide enough to profit from.The author is long UA and short UAA.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 SurpriseThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postUnder Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Everappeared first onInvestorPlace."

These 2 Big-Brand Dividend Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap;2/26/2017;"It's getting harder and harder to find value in the stock   market. But there are still a few sectors that Mr. Market seems   to have overlooked. One big one: auto stocks.Not all auto stocks have been overlooked, of course. Silicon   Valley's electric-car darling,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , gets alotof attention from investors. It's obvious why: Tesla's story is   arguably the future of autos, unfolding here in the present.   Investors love that.The thing is, Tesla isn't the only company moving the auto   industry from the gas-guzzling present to a connected,   electrified future. A few of the old automakers are right in the   cutting-edge mix, making smart, aggressive moves to thrive and   profit as the industry transforms.makeArticleAd();To some extent, those stories are happening a bit below Wall   Street's radar. Investors haven't yet caught on, in part because   Tesla's story has overshadowed the others.That's a prime recipe for value. Here are two big-name   automakers that are well-positioned for the future, available   today at value prices -- both sporting dividend yields over   4%.Ford Motor Company: Using pickup profits to transformWhen you think ofFord Motor Company(NYSE: F) , you might think about huge-selling pickup trucks, or   Ford's dramatic turnaround a few years ago.You probably aren't thinking about electric cars,   self-driving, or new concepts of personal mobility that don't   involve selling cars to individuals. But CEO Mark Fields and his   team, all battle-tested veterans of that turnaround, are doing a   lot of thinking about all of those things these days.Ford's super-profitable pickups are helping to fund electric     cars and new high-tech businesses as the Blue Oval transforms.     Image source: Ford Motor Company.In fact, they're doing more than thinking. Last fall, Ford   explained how it's transforming itself into an ""automotive and   mobility company."" In a nutshell, Ford is making major moves to   optimize the profitability of its current business while   simultaneously making biginvestmentsinself-driving,electric vehicles, and newtechnology-enabled conceptsof ""mobility,"" ortransportation as a service. (Click on each to learn more.)Ford is already solidly profitable. It postedoperating profit of $10.4 billion in 2016(its second-best ever) with a 6.7% operating profit margin in its   auto-related business. Ford's near-term goal is to get that   margin up to a sustainable 8% by investing in its strengths   (including all thoseextremely profitable pickup trucks) and boosting the profitability of its weaker lines of business,   likesmall carsand theresurgent Lincoln luxury brand.Ford plans to begin mass-producing self-driving cars for     fleet use in 2021. It may also sell its self-driving system to     other automakers. Image source: Ford Motor Company.That margin boost will in turn help fund Ford's new lines of   business. Those will be even more profitable: Ford is targetingoperating margin of 20% or betterin each.Long story short: Ford's bottom line is primed for significant   growth over the next few years, much of it driven by technology.   But right now, it's trading at just 7 times its adjusted 2016   earnings, while paying avery sustainable4.8% dividend.General Motors: Jumping ahead of Silicon ValleyI've listedGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) second only because investors have started to catch on   to its great story. While Ford's stock price hasn't done much   over the last year, GM's is up almost 28%. But as I'll explain,   at just 6.1 times 2016 earnings, GM's stock is still a very good   value given the story that's unfolding.GMdata byYChartsIn a lot of ways, GM's story is like Ford's. GM is making big   moves to boost the profitability of its core business while   investing in new technology-enabled businesses that will help it   thrive and profit instead of being ""disrupted"" as the industry   transforms.But GM is arguably farther along. GM beat everyone, even   Tesla, to market with anaffordable 200-plus-mile electric car. It's gearing up for ahuge test of ""thousands"" of self-driving   vehicleswith ride-hailing start-up Lyft, of which GMowns 9%. GM's car-sharing business, Maven, is afast-growing high-tech rival to Zipcar-- and as with GM's partnership with Lyft, Maven is introducing   lots of young urban folks to GM's best new models.The electric Chevy Bolt is GM's platform for future tech --     and the first of a whole line of electric GM vehicles. Image     source: General Motors.Meanwhile, GM's core business is already performing at a level   few could have imagined a decade ago. Itearned $12.5 billion in operating profitlast year, with a margin of 7.5%, on all-time record revenue of   $166.4 billion. CEO Mary Barra thinks GM can do better: Several   initiatives are under way to push that margin up into the 8% to   10% range over the next few years.GM'sdividend is deliberately conservative, to ensure that it's sustainable through a downturn. But even   so, and despite the run-up in GM's stock price over the last   year, it's still yielding about 4.1%. Rather than raising the   dividend to levels it might not be able to sustain, GM is   returning cash to its owners with share buybacks --$14 billion worthsince early 2015.Long story short, here's what you get with GM today: profit   growth, cutting-edge technology, a strong and steady dividend, an   ongoing share-buyback program, and a value price.10 stocks we like even better than Ford and General   MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

ETFs in Focus on Tesla???s Mixed Q4 Results;2/26/2017;"Tesla Inc.released its fourth-quarter 2016 results after market hours on February 22, 2017,posting revenues of $2.28 billion, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.201 billion.  However, the company reported a loss of $1.25 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.19 per share.  This number excludes 47 cents from non-recurring items. Concurrent with the release, Tesla also announced that CFO,Jason Wheelerwill be resigning in April 2017.OutlookInitial production of the company's Model 3 is on track to begin this July while volume production is expected by September. Tesla expects capital expenditure between  $2 billion and $2.5 billion ahead of the start of Model 3 production. Tesla expects to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined in the first half of 2017, which represents vehicle delivery growth of 61% to 71% compared with the year-ago period.Currently, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  The stock was up 1.52% to $277.67 in after-hours trading following the earnings release owing to the revenue beat.Given the earnings report and investors' reaction, we have selected the following ETFs that are heavily invested in the company. If the stock gains traction ahead on the rollout of the Model 3 electric sedan, positions in these funds can be beneficial for investors (see:all the Alternative Energy ETFs here).VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF(GEX)This ETF tracks the Ardour Global Index, focusing on companies that are primarily engaged in the business of alternative energy.

The fund has an average daily volume of about 2,500 shares. Tesla Motors occupies the top position in the basket with about 12.3% allocation.In terms of country exposure, the fund is skewed toward the U.S. with 51% share while Denmark also has a double-digit allocation with 12%. The fund has added about 8.9% so far this year (as of February 22, 2017) (read:Future of Clean Energy ETFs in Trump Era).ARK Industrial Innovation ETF(ARKQ)This fund does not track any index in particular as it is an actively managed ETF seeking long-term capital appreciation by looking for companies that stand to gain from the development of new products or services, technological improvement and advancements in scientific research related to robotics, energy storage, innovative materials, alternative energy sources, infrastructure development, space exploration, autonomous vehicles and 3D printing.As such, the fund's top rank holder is Tesla with an 11.1% holding. The fund has 34 holdings with an AUM of approximately $17.5 million and charges a fee of 75 bps.  Average daily volume is about 8,200 shares. With more than 80% exposure to the U.S. equity market, it provides good diversification across large, medium and small cap companies.

Just Wait: Better Batteries Are Going to Turn the Energy Industry Upside Down;2/26/2017;"Sometimes it's hard to see innovation happening until one day,   you wake up and realize everything has changed. A decade ago,   smartphones were the stuff of science fiction, cheap solar energy   was a pipe dream, and Elon Musk was still struggling to keep his   electric car startup alive. Today, all three are huge growth   stories.The underlying technologies that drove the innovative products   in smartphones, solar, and EVs were present in 2007, but most   people just didn't see how they could be practically adapted to   revolutionize the world in such a short time.Today, improvements in battery technology are on the cusp of   changing everything we know about energy in transportation and   electricity. The groundwork has already been laid, and a decade   from now, we'll look back and think about how obvious the   transformation should have been ahead of time.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Batteries are the new solar panelsBefore we dive into how batteries will change everything, I   think it's important to frame what's going on today. The future   of growing battery use and falling cost has some precedent in the   energy industry. When I started writing for The Motley Fool in   2010, the solar power industry was small, andthe cost to manufacture a solar panel was about   $1.10 per watt, meaning buying a panel on the open market would cost you around   $1.60 per watt. In 2017, solar panel prices hit $0.40 per watt on   the spot market, a quarter of their cost just seven years   earlier, and a much faster cost reduction than anyone had   predicted. It's no coincidence that between 2010 and 2016 solar   installations globally nearly quintupled from 16 GW to74 GW.The same dynamic is happening in the battery market today,   with massive capacity additions, cost reductions, and technology   improvements happening at multiple companies simultaneously   around the world.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Gigafactory gets a lot of attention, and Musk   has said a 35% reduction in battery costs could be coming. Worth   noting that he claimed his costs were below $190 per kWh early   last year.By 2020, the forecasts have battery costs falling to below   $100 per kWh, with manufacturersSamsung,Panasonic, andLG Chemleading the way. LG Chem is the supplier for the recently   launched Chevy Bolt, which reportedly got battery cells for just   $145 per kWH.On top of these cost reductions, industry sources say that   energy density has doubled, allowing more energy to be packed   into a smaller space. And as space constraints fall and costs   come down, the potential for batteries to disrupt the energy   sector increases.Changing everything we thought we knew about     transportationWhen electric vehicles started to emerge on the scene, battery   cost alone was a deterrent to manufacturing or buying them. When   batteries were $400 per kWh a few years ago, that meant that by   itself, the 65 kWh battery that powered a Tesla cost $26,000. But   with $100 per kWh pricing on the horizon, a 100 kWh battery would   cost just $10,000 and provide a car over 300 miles in range per   charge, making EVs a much more palatable choice.It's no coincidence thatGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) ,BMW, Tesla, and many others are accelerating their EV development   now. Batteries themselves are no longer a hurdle for the industry   to get over; soon, they will be a cost advantage over   conventional vehicles.I'm also becoming more convinced that transportation can be   disrupted on a larger scale. Electric buses built by companies   likeProterraare now cost competitive with diesel powered models,Mercedes-Benzis testing urban e-trucks, and new companies likeNicola Oneare launching electric semi-tractors.The market growth of electric vehicles of all sizes is like a   ball rolling down a hill -- we just don't know how fast it's   rolling or where it's going to land. But with battery prices   dropping, we can be assured that the disruption in the   transportation industry is just beginning.Electricity will never be the sameWhile batteries in vehicles will be a highly visible   application, power storage may be just as important to the energy   industry overall. Batteries can store energy to make the grid   more reliable, to offset the intermittence of renewable energy   sources like wind and solar, and even justify delaying or   cancelling the construction of ""peaker plants"" that come online   only during periods of high demand.The incredible innovation better, cheaper batteries allow is   the ability to think of electricity as more than a constant   supply-and-demand equation. Since the grid was built, generators   had to match their production capacity with peak demand, no   matter what that demand was. Now, we can move excess supply from   one time of a day to another, and begin to start using energy   more efficiently.Batteries can also be installed in homes, at businesses, or by   grid operators. When a customer can react to price signals at a   moment's notice or can cheaply and easily store the energy from   their rooftop solar panels for use at night, it changes the   electricity business forever.Batteries are going to change everythingThe rapid cost reductions and improving technology in the   battery industry are going to change a lot of what we thought we   knew about energy. And as these products get more cost effective   they'll become more common and soon they'll be commonplace.A decade from now, it won't be strange to drive an electric   car, or take an electric bus, home from work, and flip on lights   that are powered by solar or wind-generated electricity stored in   your battery system. The revolution is clearly happening, and   investors should make sure they're on the right side of the   disruption so they don't get run over.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla, Fitbit and Square;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday, I'd like to take a look at three stocks -Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) andSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ) - that caused the biggest reactions this week.makeArticleAd();Source:FamZoo Staff via Flickr (Modified)It's fun to dig into quarterly numbers, but it's equally fun watching investors react to those very numbers and sometimes exaggerate even the slightest deviation from the models.So much hope is already leveraged in every tick on these charts that a penny can create or destroy billions in market cap - and when many high-multiple names report simultaneously, the fireworks get intense.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThis week, the fireworks were intense.High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla Inc (TSLA)Source: ShutterstockTesla probably has the biggest cult on Wall Street right now, producing just 83,000 cars a year to justify a $45 billion valuation.The key, as always, is growth: According to Elon Musk's conference call last night, the assembly line should accelerate 500% this year and then double again in 2018. News that sales last quarter ramped up 30% year-over-year supports the still-hypothetical timeline and it even brings it incrementally closer.Beyond that all-important ramp, TSLA is still bleeding cash, which is far from surprising. While the burn rate is narrowing, Musk is still going to be burning capital for at least another year.Until then, the market feels comfortable moving Tesla Inc shares around at roughly 4.4x trailing sales - and this quarter at least, Musk gave us a reason to keep cheering in the long-term.High-Impact Tech Earnings: Fitbit Inc (FIT)Source:Via FitbitFitbit, on the other hand, may be bouncing now, but the fallen star is still staring down the gun of declining sales and it has little concrete comfort to give investors wondering whether to hang around a few years for the product mix to turn around.That may never happen. FIT sales in the key holiday quarter came in a little below Wall Street's already heavily discounted forecasts. A few months ago, the bulls were counting on this quarter to bring year-over-year growth back, but it's clear that just didn't happen.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverNow that the final numbers are on the table, sales actually declined nearly 20% from last year, which pushes the recovery window back to 2019, if not beyond. That's a long time to run at a loss, and in the meantime, Fitbit Inc's research and development investment lags entrenched would-be competitors who want the wearable computing market for themselves.High-Impact Tech Earnings: Square Inc (SQ)Source:Via SquareSquare showed us the biggest fireworks. The stock was geared for 20% top-line growth, while Wall Street wanted confirmation that revenue would clear $2 billion across the current year in order to keep that growth ramp - and we got it.What has earned the company a standing ovation is management's success when it comes to reducing the quarterly cash burn. SQ should actually break even on an adjusted basis in its next earnings report and earn as much as $0.19 a share for all of 2017 once all the ""adjustments"" are made.If so, we're a lot closer to GAAP profitability than many people thought. Inflection points like that do great things to stock valuations, which is why people are piling in on Square Inc now while they can.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Netflix, Inc.: How to Buy NFLX Stock on the Cheap;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's far from a unique viewing experience -Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has forged a massive post-election rally to all-time-highs. But given the exaggerated level of overall market optimism, I think a scary picture could show up in a pricey NFLX stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)For investors looking to pick up shares while there's blood in the streets, Netflix stock is offerign that kind of opportunity today.If you're a Netflix bull, it probably has to do with the company's sizable advantage in the SVOD or streaming video on demand? Or maybe you enjoy Netflix's original and top-notch content likeHouse of Cards,Stranger Things,Orange is the New BlackorTheCrown?Bullish investors might also begawking over Netflix's earnings beat last monthand the company's unexpectedly strong international subscriber growth which easily topped forecasts. At the end of the day, Netflix deserves credit for its accomplishments.The bad news is if you're an NFLX stock holder right now, you're paying dearly those successes. Netflix is expensive by most any measure and ultimately will require a good deal of things to continue to go right.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteBottom line: Competition and the rising cost to do business to remain top dog aren't going away anytime soon. But that's not to say Netflix can't remain expensive, or that it won't continue to dominate the SVOD space. Growth stocks like Netflix historically have a knack of keeping shares beyond the reach of value investors during their greatest periods of price appreciation. And for quite a few years, NFLX stock has been a poster child of this phenomenon.Personally, I subscribe both literally and figuratively to Netflix's largess, and overall, its product as a consumer. Netflix isn't perfect, but I am happily willing to pay for it. That said, I think NFLX could be ready to hit the rewind button. And that means it's not time to outright purchase shares.But …NFLX Stock ChartClick to EnlargeNetflix has gained 30% since a post-election low near $111. Prior pivot resistance and the 62% retracement level offered technical support.As part of those gains, shares broke out from a weekly handle and then its all-time-highs of $133.27 as a large corrective cup pattern was cleared. Given the size and duration of the chart formation, Netflix's breakout move of around 10% above the cup isn't considered technically extended.That's the good news.The bad news is the overall market's less stingy behavior, Netflix's overbought stochastics and the stock's rich market multiple. I think a test of the prior highs will develop, and NFLX stock will offer a better entry point.How to Trade NFLX StockRight now, I like the 24 Mar $134/$130 put spread. With shares of Netflix sitting around $143, the out-of-the-money vertical is priced for a credit of 50 cents mid-market. If NFLX stock is above $134 at expiration, the sold premium amounts to a return of 14% for the one-month holding period. This allows for a decline or margin of safety of more than 6%.A breakeven of $133.50 fits in very nicely with our anticipated test of prior highs discussed above. But if NFLX moves lower and fails to hold support, ultimately this vertical limits the investor's risk to $3.50 no matter how low shares might sink.Why Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Plunged, And Why You Should BuyIf investors fail to capture the credit and are faced with a loss, and they're still a fan of Netflix stock, they can receive shares through assignment or close the spread and purchase stock instead.If you do want to buy NFLX stock, the most you would pay is $133.50. What's more, this ensures that an effective entry price is never more than $3.50 above the current share price.That's good news, just in case.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

However, theDirexion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust(NYSEARCA:NUGT) options allow me to structure trades around the miners. But remember: NUGT is a leveraged vehicle that trades on gold miners, so caution is always warranted.makeArticleAd();Source:Jeremy Vohwinkle via Flickr (Modified)I'll point out that I just booked profits long theSPDR Gold Trust (ETF)(NYSEARCA:GLD). There could be more upside in my technical breakout, but GLD is facing recently difficult levels.Fundamentally, I prefer going long GLD than NUGT, but in this ube- bullish equity market, gold miner companies should catch bids.

It could be triggered around $13.7 per share and could carry it to $16 per share or higher.How to Trade NUGT Right NowThe Bet:Sell NUGT Apr $8/$7 credit put spread for 20 cents per contract to open. I am basically betting that NUGT won't revisit the extreme lows of December 2016. My reward if successful would be 25% on money risked.

In this case I want to sell upside risk against my bullish NUGT position.The Hedge (Optional):Sell NUGT Jun $20/$21 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect 20 cents per contract to open. If successful, this trade would yield 25% on money risked. This trade also carries a 85% theoretical chance of success based on current conditions.Taking both trades won't make it a perfect iron condor, but it would be the spirit of one. I have a total of 40 cents per contract in potential profit, but the timing is staggered. This would allow for easier trade management in leveraged tickers like NUGT.Ideally, I want this ETF's price to be rangebound between both sold spreads for it to expire worthless for maximum gains.I am not required to hold my options trades through expiration. I can close any position at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Why Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Plunged, And Why You Should Buy;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWall Street is a fickle beast. All you need to confirm that isTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The company reported a fourth-quarter loss that narrowed to 69 cents per share from $2.02 a year ago, and revenues that nearly doubled from to $2.28 billion from $1.21 billion. And yet, TSLA stock plunged roughly 6.4% following the report.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat even ignored Tesla's announcement that Model 3 production was on pace with expectations and that it would deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles in the first quarter compared to just 76,000 vehicles in all of 2016.What gives?Well, there are several reasons that the financial media are floating for the drop in Tesla stock.Earnings missed expectationsfor a loss of only 43 cents per share (even though revenue bested Wall Street's forecast for $2.19 billion).There is also the narrative that margins and revenue are cloudy due to the SolarCity acquisition.Finally, the prevailing story for the knee-jerk selloff in TSLA stock is thatCEO Elon Musk hintedthat the company could issue more shares to raise capital for Model 3 production.All of these are valid reasons for a selloff.The problem is that Wall Street and investors knew about all of these factors prior to Tesla's quarterly earnings report.  In fact, afterOppenheimer said on Feb. 14that investors should expect Tesla to take advantage of its recent highs to issue new stock to raise funds for Model 3 production, TSLA stock went on a two-day 4% rally to a new all-time high.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowWhich brings us to the real reason Tesla stock is down following earnings: profit taking.What's Going on With Tesla?Click to EnlargeShares are up an impressive 32% since the November elections, with most of those gains coming since the start of 2017. As a result, TSLA was considerably overbought, and traders are taking this opportunity to use previously known issues to take profits off the table.If you're in holding TSLA stock for the long-term, don't panic. According to Tesla's quarterly report, the Model 3 is still on track for full production in July, and deliveries are ramping up in fine style (remember 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles in the first quarter compared to just 76,000 vehicles in all of 2016?)  And that's not to mention the opportunities that Tesla is working on outside of is electric vehicle operations.In fact, with Tesla trading at a discount near $255 on Friday, TSLA stock is a buy.The problem isn't whether shares will bounce back, it's a matter of how to pick them up amid the current market volatility.The answer is options.Looking out over the short-term, March TSLA options implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 7% heading into expiration. As a result, the upper bound lies at about $269, while the lower bound rests near $234.With key support near $250, I would be extremely surprised to see TSLA stock trade near $235, and the upper bound of $269 rests well shy of the stock's recent all-time highs, leaving plenty of room for a rebound run higher.2 Trades for TSLA StockMarried Put:On way to buy Tesla at current levels and ensure you have peace of mind in your portfolio is to enter what is called a ""married put."" In this strategy, traders buy to open one front-month at-the-money or out-of-the-money TSLA put for every 100 shares purchased.The strike of the purchased put should reflect your risk tolerance. So, a March $250 put offers nearly full protection at current levels, with losses limited to about the cost of the put and brokerage fees. An out-of-the-money March $245 put would allow for TSLA to dip a bit further before the ""insurance"" kicked in.Buy Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock While the World Hates ItAt last check, the TSLA March $250 put was offered at $6.78, or $678 per contract, while the stock position would total $roughly $252 at pre-open levels. If TSLA closes below $250 when March options expire, you would be able to exit the position and avoid any additional losses by exercising the put.Finally, if Tesla holds above $200 through March expiration, you can roll the $250 put forward into April if you feel you still need the protection.Put Sell:You'll usually see me recommend put sell positions as a way to capture premium on a stock, but you can also use these options as a way to essentially name the price you want to pay for a stock. If you want to own TSLA stock, but want to wait for it to dip below $250, you could sell the March $250 put for $6.78, or $678 per contract, collect the premium, and wait for the shares to pull back.If Tesla doesn't trade below $250, you still keep the premium and can roll your target out to the next contract month and try again. The downside here is that if TSLA never hits your target, you never own the shares at the price you want to pay.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Making a Money GrabAmazon.com, Inc.

JPMorgan Fund Boosts Retirement Accounts With Hot Stocks;2/24/2017;"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund   (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned   into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon   for investors holding the fund inretirement accountsand other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going   into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked   by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the   fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its   peers.makeArticleAd();The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmakerBroadcom(AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of theIBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE:Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally     acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry     Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial     breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this     level,so investors may want to consider locking-in     some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more     conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking     profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmakerTesla(TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On   Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its   mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car-   and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per   share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts.   Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its   battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the   stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback   left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and   mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook(FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was   another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which   the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this   year.Facebookis ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has   a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax   margin is 60%.Amazon(AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a   so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds   from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a   row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the   company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of   Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those includedUnitedHealth Group(UNH),Southwest Airlines(LUV),MercadoLibra(MELI),Morgan Stanley(MS) andFedEx(FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The   others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has   posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames.   It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group,   thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining   EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter.   Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And   its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1   e-commerce company. It is often referred to as theeBay(EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's   Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four   consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No.   1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group.   Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected   to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its   industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS   growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the   past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth   rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual   EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names likeApple(AAPL) andMasterCard(MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the   80s and 90s, includingHome Depot(HD),Nvidia(NVDA) andComcast(CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99   Comp Rating - the highest possible - and six straight   quarters of EPS growth acceleration. Sales shot up 55% last   quarter.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap     Growth FundWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock     Gains In 2017"

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM) Stock: Profit From the Pain;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis tech stock rally has been one for the ages. But now is not the time for bulls to rest on their laurels. Overbought conditions in theNasdaq Compositecoupled with Thursday's down day make now the perfect time to get defensive. And what better way to do that then add some bearish plays to the portfolio?Akamai Technologies, Inc.(NASDAQ:AKAM) is looking particularly vulnerable, so let's see what kind of trade we can drum up in AKAM stock.makeArticleAd();All was going swell with Akamai until this month's earnings announcement. The cloud services provider was perched near 52-week highs heading into the quarterly dance. And then, AKAM dared to disappoint the Street. Note that Akamai recorded beats on both the top and bottom lines - but apparently those beats simply weren't enough.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixMercy was thrown out the window, and sellers took AKAM stock down 10% by day's end. Since then, the stock has been drifting lower in bearish fashion.Though the 200-day moving average is still pointing higher, the 20-day and 50-day averages have rolled over. And that means any and all rallies in Akamai stock are suspect.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe level to watch moving forward is $62. A break of this support zone could lead to a gap-fill carrying shares down to $59.The Trade on AKAM StockTo capitalize on continued bearish behavior, consider selling April bear call spreads. The strategy enables you to profit from the passage of time. One of the biggest benefits to the bear call spread is its high probability of profit. We can create a wide profit zone that generates modest rewards if Akamai does anything but rally significantly.Sell the Apr $65/$67.50 call spread for 64 cents. The position consists of selling to open the $65 call while buying to open the $67.50 call. Your reward will be limited to the 64 cents which will be captured if AKAM stock sits below $65 at expiration.Don't Pay for Square Inc (SQ) Stock, Get It for Free!The risk is limited to the distance between strikes minus the net credit, or $1.86, and will be forfeited if AKAM rallies above $67.50 by expiration.If you're looking for more downside confirmation before entering the trade, consider waiting for a break of the previously mentioned $62 support level.As of this writing, Tyler Craig had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceChesapeake Energy: Catch This Falling KnifeAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Making a Money GrabTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryThe postAkamai Technologies, Inc.

Chesapeake Energy: Catch This Falling Knife;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChesapeake Energy Corporation(NYSE:CHK) reported earnings on Thursday, and Wall Street sold CHK stock down 3%. Chesapeake beat expectations for the most part, but traders found offsetting reasons to worry.makeArticleAd();Source:Philadelphia 76ers Via FlickrFundamentally, Chesapeake Energy is not on solid footing. It has internal issues with regards to production and high debt. The company also faces the ongoing hurdles in the energy arena. So to say that CHK stock is a sure bet for longs would be a stretch.It is noteworthy that most analysts already are realistic with regards to Chesapeake Energy Corporation's prospects. Most ratings have it as a hold. So the threat of downgrades is low.Technically, having just lost an important neckline, CHK stock is at risk of further downside even past $5 per share. Trying to catch this falling machete could cost me a few fingers.Click to EnlargeLuckily, the options markets allow me to set cautious long CHK positions. The trick is to find levels that are relatively safe and that won't be breached. The underlying assumption to this trade setup is that the company will survive.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsI don't need Chesapeake Energy to rally; I just need it to not fall more than 30% this year.How to Trade CHK Stock HereThe Bet:Sell the Jan 2018 $4 put for 50 cents per contract to open. The 30% buffer from current price gives this trade a 70% theoretical chance of success. Usually I like bigger starting buffers for leaps, but in this case, I am banking on the aforementioned assumption holding true.Selling naked puts is risky and therefore is not appropriate for all investors. I can modify the trade into a spread instead to limit the risk and thereby rendering it more conducive to conservative traders.The Alternate:Sell the Jan 2018 $4/$3.50 credit put spread. This still is a bullish trade and I still need CHK stock to stay above the same strike sold. But here my risk is finite. I collect 15 cents per contract to open. If successful, the trade would yield 40% on money risked. Both trades have the same theoretical chances of success.Chesapeake Energy (CHK) Stock Is the Right Way to Play OPECUsually I like to balance my trade by selling opposing risk. In this case, I will refrain from doing so at this time. I don't like selling call spreads after a sharp drop as I end up selling the trade at a discount.

Don’t Pay for Square Inc (SQ) Stock, Get It for Free!;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ) stock, unlike that ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), is flying high. One can argue that Jack Dorsey is spending more time running SQ and not enough time tending to the struggling Twitter.makeArticleAd();Source:Via SquareBoth companies reported earnings recently, with TWTR falling 12% or so whereas SQ stock spiked 14% on the news.I rarely chase spikes of this size, but in relation to its initial offering, SQ stock could be headed much higher in the long term. The company seems to be doing all the right things to keep Wall Street interested in owning its stock.Fundamentally, Square has formidable competitors, but I think they managed to carve a great niche. Yes, they have to battle giants likePaypal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL), but to me they don't seem like comparable in my portfolio.Before you call me stupid for uttering those words, I am only interested in the stock price perspective. I see Square stock as a faster runner with more momentum aback the ""hopium"" of exciting innovation that is yet to come. I use PayPal often and have never used Square … but perception is all that matters for price action.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThe Bet:Buy the SQ Jun $18/$19 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade that costs 35 cents per contract to open. If SQ stock rallies past my spread by mid-June, then I stand to double my money. There are hundreds of other ways I can use options to accomplish this.Usually I like to hedge my bets. In this case, I will sell downside risk to negate my out-of-pocket expense into my long trade.The Bank:Sell the SQ Jan 2018 $12 put. I collect 70 cents per contract to open. The buffer from current price gives me an 85% theoretical chance of success.Selling naked puts is risky because I am committing to buying the stock at my sold strike if SQ stock falls below it. So my thesis better hold up or I could be exposed to losses below $11.30 per share. Conversely, if SQ stock stays above my sold puts, any premium I capture from selling my long call position is pure profit. So I don't really need SQ to rally much to profit.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowI am not required to hold the any options trades through expiration.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Making a Money Grab;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt first blush, the purchase byAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) ofMoneygram International Inc(NASDAQ:MGI) doesn't seem like a huge deal for BABA stock. Alibaba affiliateAntFinancialis paying $880 million for MGI, after all. Yet, Alibaba stock is worth nearly $250 billion - almost 300 times the acquisition price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI wouldn't dismiss the deal as ""minor"" so quickly, however. While the purchase price isn't high, and the near-term impact on BABA stock is likely minimal, Moneygram highlights the long-term strategy and potential for Alibaba.The bull case for Alibaba stock has two major pillars: First, the company can move beyond China to being a worldwide player and a legitimate competitor toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Second, like Amazon, Alibaba can move from its e-commerce roots into all sort of profitable efforts.The Moneygram acquisition scores well on both counts. Alibaba continues its push into the West. And, through the tie-up of Ant Financial and Moneygram, it continues its entry into the potentially lucrative digital banking and payment services markets.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowStrategically, the deal lays the groundwork for further growth of BABA stock - and at a very reasonable price. Investors shouldn't dismiss the deal simply because the price doesn't seem high enough to matter.Alibaba Stock Needs International GrowthAt the moment, Alibaba's business still relies on Chinese e-commerce. In the company's third quarter (ending Dec. 31), China commerce generated 80% of revenue, with ~96% of that figure coming from retail. Other businesses, including cloud computing and entertainment, make up the other 20%. But, those businesses remain unprofitable; Alibaba earnings remain dependent on Chinese commerce. That's a bit of risk on its own, given concerns about the Chinese economy.Ant Financial isn't consolidated onto Alibaba's P&L, and at the moment, BABA has a profit-sharing agreement and could take up to one-third of Ant's equity in an IPO. But, even that minority ownership means Alibaba can use Ant Financial as an entrance into international markets, and that's where Moneygram fits nicely.To begin, Ant can target Chinese expatriates in the U.S. and elsewhere. Ant already has joint ventures and partnerships worldwide, and Moneygram further supports its payment infrastructure. Plus, Alibaba's other offerings such as e-commerce, entertainment and even cloud services, can follow Ant's lead.At a valuation of nearly $250 billion, Alibaba stock probably can't hold up on the Chinese market alone, considering the sheer size of that market. There are too many concerns about the macro environment in that country. Internet and e-commerce penetration is increasing, but still low relative to developed countries. Every step Alibaba takes toward becoming a legitimate international presence - and a real competitor to Amazon - supports the bull case for BABA stock.The Moneygram purchase is actually a big step in that direction.Alibaba Isn't Just a RetailerIt's hard to imagine what Amazon.com might look like had the company decided to be ""only"" an e-commerce retailer. It's almost certain that AMZN stock would trade well below its current levels of approximately $840 per share.Alibaba has certainly learned lessons from its American peer. It's moved into cloud as well, where the companyhas built a viable businesswith worldwide aspirations. Now, Alibaba is looking to Hollywood for growth.Further, the company has the infrastructure for a worldwide payments business, at a time when the future of that industry is in serious flux. That's a significant opportunity for BABA stock, even for a company the size of Alibaba's, and even with the company owning only a portion of Ant Financial.Paypal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) is worth more than $50 billion. Combined,Visa Inc(NYSE:V),Mastercard Inc(NYSE:MA) andAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) are valued around $400 billion.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThat's not to suggest that Ant is the next Visa, or even the next Paypal. But, Ant's efforts in payment services can move the needle for Alibaba stock, even given BABA's $250 billion valuation. Plus, Visa and Mastercard don't have the added luxury of using a payment services platform to grow retail sales.All told, I continue to believe that BABA stock is undervalued. I don't know that the Moneygram acquisition changes that dramatically in the near term, but it highlights the potential of the long-term strategy here. Owning a Chinese e-commerce retailer might seem to have a lot risk at the moment, but Alibaba isn't just a Chinese e-commerce retailer anymore - and that's good news for BABA stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryApple Inc.

TheS&P 500 Indexposted a gain of a fraction of a percentage, theDow Jones Industrial Averagegained 0.2% and theNasdaq Compositelost 0.4%.makeArticleAd();It was another busy earnings day that included mixed results from several companies, includingAcacia Communications, Inc.(NASDAQ:ACIA),Baidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) andNordstrom, Inc.(NYSE:JWN).Here's what you should know:Acacia Communications, Inc. (ACIA)Acacia Communications shares were hammered in the evening as the company released a forecastthat underwhelmed. The company reported earnings of $64.5 million, or $1.55 per share for its latest three-month period. Adjusted for stock-based compensations, Acacia posted earnings of 94 cents per share, well ahead of the 90 cents per share that analysts expected.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsRevenue was also better than what the consensus estimate called for as the company raked in $142.4 million. This figure was $2.7 million higher than the $139.7 million that Wall Street was calling for.However, ACIA stock took a massive hit as the company released a first-quarter forecast that will be about 70 cents per share.

Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN) Stock Looks Great After Q4 Earnings;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNordstrom, Inc.(NYSE:JWN) tumbled ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report Thursday, but JWN stock is headed in the right direction once more after a better-than-expected result.makeArticleAd();Source:Phillip Pessar via Flickr (Modified)The short story: Profits looked good, revenues are still going, margins are showing signs of stabilization and cash flows are about to get a nice boost. Yet the valuation of JWN shares remains depressed, leading me to believe that Nordstrom stock is going to head higher.A lot higher.The Margin Story Is Getting BetterFirst, the headline numbers: Nordstrom earnings for Q4 came to $1.37 per share, easily beating estimates of $.122 per share. Revenues of $4.2 billion were up 2.4% year-over-year, but did fall shy of estimates for $4.37 billion.On the margin side, though, the story keeps getting better.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowSimilar toMacy's Inc.(NYSE:M) andKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS), JWN saw gross margins expand healthily in the quarter. Nordstrom, though, is significantly outperforming its mall peers. Retail gross profit rate increased more than 100 basis points in the quarter, versus 90 basis points at Macy's and 33 basis points and Kohl's. This is due to management's strong execution.Firstly, JWN is getting a handle on inventories. Sales growth outpaced inventory growth at Nordstrom by 500 basis points in Q4. Secondly, the company is putting an emphasis on private label brands. This provides a shield against mall-wide promotional activity. Going forward, gross margins should begin to experience some level of stabilization and maybe even steadily expand.Operating expense growth also really came down this year. Because the transition to a multi-channel business model required significant investment, JWN's operating expenses grew at 9% per year from 2010 to 2015. The investments paid off, and Nordstrom's e-commerce business now represents a fourth of overall sales (versus 8% in 2010).More importantly, though, this early digital success has been followed by less aggressive spend. Operating expenses only grew 4% this year. JWN management implied opex would grow at a lower rate over the next several years.In other words, the ""big"" spending era seems to be over. That means we might start to see some opex leverage over the next several years. Opex leverage plus buybacks would flow into earnings growth greatly in excess of 3 to 4% per year.Again, that isn't bad considering that JWN stock is trading at less than 15 times earnings.The Nordstrom BrandThe Nordstrom brand continues to underperform while Nordstrom Rack continues to outperform. This underscores the price sensitivity of the average JWN customer. That isn't great against the backdrop of intense price competition from other retailers.There are, though, several near-term catalysts which could re-spark growth in the full-priced business.Nordstrom is rolling out a new ""reserve merchandise"" mobile feature in 2017 to help drive full-priced sales. The Seattle pilot had tremendous success at a select few JWN stores, so there is upside for sales in 2017 behind greater mobile commerce engagement.Nordstrom's buy-online, pick-up-in-store program had a great 2016 with sales volume growth of 45%.The Canada business is only at $300 million in sales out of a $1 billion opportunity.JWN experienced 55% year-over-year growth this year in its Rewards member base to 7.8 million customers.Overall, JWN management is guiding for 3 to 4% revenue growth this year. That is an appropriate multiyear compounded growth rate. In other words, Nordstrom should be able to grow revenues around 3% to 4% per year over the next several years.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryThat isn't bad for a ""going-out-business"" department store. Especially considering that JWN stock trades at less than 15 times trailing earnings.Bright Cash Flow FutureThe end of the ""big"" spending era is also a significant boost to JWN cash flows. Despite margin compression and slower revenue growth, JWN posted exceptional cash flow metrics in 2016. Nordstrom's operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, far above the trailing 5-year average of $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, free cash flow was $550 million, also significantly higher than the trailing 5-year average.There are a couple things at play here.To adjust to lower sales growth, JWN management is keeping inventories down. This is significantly boosting operating cash flows. Moreover, Nordstrom decreased capital expenditures by 20% year-over-year. Both of these cash flow tailwinds are here to stay. JWN management is committed to tight inventory control, and capex will equal 4% of sales over the next several years versus 5% historically.All together, the company is positioned to see a strong boost in cash flows over the next five years.Bottom Line on JWN StockNordstrom sports a 3.3% dividend yield and only trades at 14.5 times trailing earnings. Revenue growth is positive, and will remain positive into the foreseeable future given robust e-commerce growth. Margins will stabilize in the near future, and earnings have a promising growth trajectory. Most importantly, the company is set to return more cash to shareholders than ever before.Drop Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Before It Drops YouThe stock traded around $60 per share just 2 months ago. The story today is a lot stronger than it was two months ago. From an investor standpoint, this is a good set-up for significant share price appreciation over the next several months.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock Is Just Dying to Take Flight;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSeveral airline stocks that look interesting based on their charts, but there is one that particularly looks interesting to me as an options trader. That stock isUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMaybe I'm biased on UAL stock because I just booked a flight from Chicago to Miami on United. Or maybe it's just that airlines - includingAmerican Airlines Group Inc(NASDAQ:AAL) andDelta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) - have made double-digit gains since the beginning of November. There are several possible reasons behind this, including President Donald Trump promising to upgrade the air traffic control system and recent interest in the airlines from Warren Buffett.For those reasons and more, I like United stock, particularly via the trade idea below.The Trade SetupThe rationale: Taking a look at the chart below, United shares moved higher throughout the month of November before settling in and trading between about $70 and $76 since the beginning of December.Click to EnlargeIn addition, UAL stock has made several attempts to move through the $76 level, including several times this week. So far it has not been able to do so.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowI will be keeping an eye out for it in case it does for a bullish directional trade.How to Trade UAL Stock HereThe trade:Sell the UAL Mar $68/$70 put credit spread (selling the Mar $70 put and buying the $68 put) for 30 cents or better.The strategy:The maximum potential profit for this trade is 30 cents if UAL stock is trading at or above $70 at Mar expiration. The maximum loss is $1.70 ($2 - $0.30) or whatever credit was received for the spread if UAL stock is trading at or below $70 at Mar expiration. Breakeven is $69.70 at expiration based on a 30-cent credit.With all out-of-the-money (OTM) credit spreads like this trade, the risk is greater than the reward. The reason for this is because of the likelihood of profit. Essentially this trade has three out of four ways to profit. The stock can move higher, trade sideways or just stay above the breakeven point at expiration.For this trade idea to be successful and finish at max profit, the stock needs to stay above the $70 level by March monthly expiration. The low end of the channel needs to act as support like it has done since early December.Adding to the potential support for this trade, the 50-day simple moving average has moved up to the $74 area, and the stock is currently trading above that level.Apple Inc. Fesses Up to iPhone 6 Battery Issue, Releases FixWhat also makes this trade idea intriguing from an options perspective is the current implied volatility of the options. The current IV is above the historical volatility (HV) levels which may indicate the current premiums may be a little inflated.This is perfect for a credit trade on UAL stock.John Kmiecik is the head options instructor for Market Taker Mentoring, and co-author of the eBook 3 Secrets to Making Money in Any Market.

Friday’s Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Facebook Inc (FB) and United States Steel Corporation (X);2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trading broadly lower this morning as Wall Street grows uneasy about the recent string of all-time highs from the major market indices. Yesterday, theDow Jones Industrial Averagehit its 10th straight record closing high, and traders this morning appear to be taking profits following the impressive run. On the economic front, new-home sales for January and consumer sentiment for February will both hit the Street this morning.makeArticleAd();Against this nervous backdrop, futures on the Dow have dropped 0.45%, withS&P 500futures down 0.5% andNasdaq-100futures falling 0.6%.On the options front, volume rebounded somewhat on Thursday, though the roughly 15.4 million calls and 14.4 million puts traded were still below average. Turning to the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose slightly to 0.62, while the 10-day moving average halted its recent decline at 0.60.Turning to Thursday's volume leaders,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) saw mixed options activity after NVDA stock was smacked with a trio of downgrades. Meanwhile,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) call options were hot yesterday following reports that the company was pursuing an MLB streaming deal. Finally,United States Steel Corporation(NYSE:X) nosedived on news that President Donald Trump could delay his infrastructure spending plans until 2018.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)With analysts getting nervous about record highs across the board on Wall Street, downgrades were bound to arrive sooner or later. NVDA stock, one of the best performing tech stocks of 2016, emerged as the whipping boy, withInstinet,BMO Capital and Nomuraall downgrading the shares due to valuation concerns.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashNomura and Instinet both set a price target of $90, while BMO went further and set a target of $85. All three noted that while growth potential in the automotive and data center markets remained strong, it didn't justify Nvidia's current valuation.NVDA stock fell nearly 9.3% as a result, and the shares are off another 4% in premarket trading this morning.Options traders appeared shaken by the news, with calls dropping to only 55% of the more than 729,000 contracts traded on NVDA stock yesterday - a near-term low for daily call activity for the shares. NVDA is now trading well below all major March call open interest accumulations, and has even breached peak March put OI of 10,000-plus contracts at $100. The $95 strike is the next potential area of options-related support, with 7,700 puts in residence at this strike.Facebook Inc (FB)WhatTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) did with the NFL, Facebook is looking to do with Major League Baseball. The social media giant is exploring adeal to stream one MLB game a weekon its website as part of a push to expand its video offerings. Facebook has experience streaming live events after streaming Mexican soccer games in English via a previous deal withUnivision.Options traders were quick to speculate on the deal, sending 397,000 contracts across the tape on Thursday. What's more, calls made up 69% of the day's take. The short-term options outlook for FB stock continues to lean bullish, as the March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.78. Peak call OI for the series numbers more than 56,000 contracts at the $135 strike, which will trade out-of-the-money this morning if pre-market losses carry over into the open.United States Steel Corporation (X)U.S. Steel stock has surged more than 80% since the election on promises of $1 trillion in infrastructure spending from President Donald Trump. However, a report released yesterday indicated thatTrump may delay his infrastructure planuntil 2018, giving many investors in infrastructure reason to worry. As a result, X stock plunged more than 7.8% on Thursday and the shares are off another 2% in premarket action this morning.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryOptions activity was nearly divided on the shares, with calls eking out 54% of the 316,000 contracts traded yesterday. It will take more than one day of mixed activity to shake X options traders, however, as the short-term outlook remains heavily bullish. Specifically, the March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.62, with calls on the verge of doubling puts among options set to expire within the next month.Peak call OI of 9,700 at the March $40 strike appears a bit out of reach at the moment, but the extended decline has made the March $35 and $36 strikes attractive to those looking for a rebound.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe postFriday's Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Facebook Inc (FB) and United States Steel Corporation (X)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. Fesses Up to iPhone 6 Battery Issue, Releases Fix;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf it seems as thoughApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been fighting with battery issues with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s for months, that's because it has.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThere was a limited recall of iPhone 6s batteries blamed on a manufacturing issue, problems in China and recently reports of widespread iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues that seemed battery related. The company always denied any widespread issue.Until now.AAPL has finally acknowledged a problem related to the iPhone 6 battery … and says it has released a fix.The iPhone 6 Battery Has Been … ProblematicIf there's one thing 2016 will be remembered for when it comes to consumer electronics, it's the challenges of working with lithium-ion batteries.5 Income Tax Deductions You Can't Afford to MissThe poster child for just how wrong this technology can go isSamsung Electronic Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Samsung had a terrible 2016 after its flagship Galaxy Note 7's lithium-ion batteries were implicated in multiple fires, This led to a complete recall of the device, an estimated $10 billion hit, a seriously damaged reputation and anextensive investigation to pinpoint the cause.In comparison, AAPL's iPhone 6 battery woes have been less spectacular, but the cloud over Apple's previous two generations of phones has lasted just as long - if not longer. And they proved much more frustrating in terms of nailing down a cause, or a fix. That's because there appear to be multiple issues at play. And just as Apple admits there's a problem and announces a solution, another iPhone 6 battery issue seems to pop up.In 2016, Apple had to deal with aninvestigation in Chinaover reports that iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s batteries were not only failing, but leaving the devices with expensive damage. Apple's findings pointed to cheap knock-off chargers as the culprit. Then there were reports of iPhone 6s phones unexpectedly shutting down. Apple eventually pinpointed the cause as being a manufacturing defect in a batch of batteries. Abattery exchange programwas launched, but that got off to a rocky start when Apple Stores were flooded by iPhone owners hoping for a replacement battery, and a backlog of repairs.Just as that mess was being sorted out, complaints began to rise of iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues. This was a new iPhone 6 battery issue and seemed to affect a growing number of users. It also affected the iPhone 6s, but not the iPhone 7.The problem got so bad that at one point in January, rumors started thatApple was planning to launch a full-scale iPhone 6 battery exchange program. However, AAPL continued to deny there was a widespread problem with iPhone and 6s batteries.Now, Apple has come clean.Apple Releases Fix for iPhone 6 Shutdown IssueThe company finally admitted that iPhone 6 and 6s phones have been suddenly and randomly shutting down, forcing owners to plug them into a charger before they can be restarted. But, AAPL says it released a fix and it's effective.In a statement released toTechCrunch, Apple says iOS 10.2.1 finally addresses the issue:""We're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down.""So what happened?AAPL says the iPhone 6 battery (and in some cases the iPhone 6s as well) suffers from a limitation of all-lithium-ion batteries. As these batteries get older, they sometime deliver power unevenly. This could trigger the iPhone's power management system to force an emergency shutdown to protect the device.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryApple made changes to that system in iOS 10.2.1, essentially making it less sensitive to minor fluctuations. It also added new functionality so that should an iPhone 6 sudden shutdown occur, the user can restart their device without having to be connected to a charger. The company says it also will add a battery diagnostic screen to iOS that warns iPhone owners when their battery requires service.The fact this issue was directly related to aging lithium-ion batteries explains why it was the iPhone 6 battery being implicated more frequently than the 6s, why the numbers seemed to keep growing and why the iPhone 7 hasn't yet been affected.Will this mark the end of AAPL's drawn out iPhone 6 battery saga? The company has been playing whack-a-mole trying to identify issues with its lithium-ion batteries. But this fix seems to be enough of an umbrella solution that it may finally be able to put this chapter behind it.And let Apple go back to the good old days when complaints were limited to wishing the iPhone lasted longer on a battery charge …As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWWDC 2017: Here's What Apple Inc.

Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE): My Favorite ETF to Trade;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of my core strategies is relative value trading. This is the essence of the original hedge fund philosophy created by A.W. Jones - to buy a stock that is comparatively cheap and hedge by selling a highly correlated security that is comparatively expensive. One of my favorite ways to employ this strategy is by usingEnergy Select Sector SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLE) versus the price of oil.makeArticleAd();By having an underlying correlated commodity to use in my decision making, I gain an edge not found with other exchange-traded funds (ETFs).One of the main reasons I look to the XLE is the deep and liquid options market available in this ETF's options. As an options analyst, the ability to express a directional viewpoint, look from relative value situations, or hedge off risk using options is paramount.XLE provides tight bid/ask spreads along with considerable volume that is the hallmark of an effective trading vehicle.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsRight now, roughly 2,000 ETFs are listed for trading. Many of these have little to no volume and no options available-the so called roach motels. Others, such as heavyweights likeSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY) or  SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEARCA:DIA), are just too liquid and too big to provide any semblance of an edge. XLE provides the right balance of volume and edge to fit effectively in my trading philosophy.XLE is comprised of some of the biggest energy names, withExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM),Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) andSchlumberger Limited.(NYSE:SLB) comprising nearly 40% of the ETF weighting. As one would expect, it is closely correlated to the price of oil, withthree-month correlationsapproaching 70%.Click to EnlargeAs the chart shows, there have been occasions when the correlation breaks down. The blue areas area highlighted show instances when the XLE ETF was a relative outperformer to crude oil, along with the subsequent mean reversion shown in the reddish circles.We recently saw another divergence in mid-December of last year, as the gains in XLE once again got ahead of the smaller gains in oil.That divergence has begun to narrow. I would look for that convergence to continue over the coming weeks.How to Handle the XLEOne way to position would be to short XLE and go long oil futures orUnited States Oil Fund LP (ETF)(NYSEARCA:USO). However, as a word of caution, USO is designed for only short-term holding and hedging periods.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryA similar strategies using options could be to sell a bearish out-of-the-money call spread on XLE and also sell a bullish out of the money put spread on USO.For those looking to add another tool to your trading toolbox, using the XLE versus oil can provide the edge that allows you to put on a profitable hedge.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous Territory;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped sharply on Thursday following the company's latest financial results. Tesla saw a narrower-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter and revenue rose almost 90% on a year-over-year basis. However, TSLA stock holders seemed to focus on the company's still-increasing cash burn rate that now raises ""concern"" for a new capital raise.makeArticleAd();As a result of Thursday's 6.45% selloff, the near- to possibly intermediate-term path of least resistance now appears to point lower.In the bigger picture, Tesla stock remains constructively positioned. And I believe shares ultimately will provide further gains for long-term investors. But for now, even bulls might have to wear their bear costumes.When I last discussed TSLA stock onDec. 16, I offered that the stock increasingly looked ready to move higher off the lower end of its bigger-picture trading range with a near-term upside target around the $215 area. This upside price target was reached just a few days later as the stock rallied a quick 8%.As a quick reminder before looking at the charts (and because yesterday I received some questions around this): How much money TSLA loses each quarter at this stage does not matter nearly as much as the rate of change in its car production and sales.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThat is the basic definition of a growth stock. And Tesla is a growth stock.TSLA Stock ChartsLooking at Tesla shares through the lens of their multiyear weekly chart, we see that TSLA has spent the majority of the past couple years bouncing around in a wide trading range that for the most part spans from around $180 on the lower end to about $285 on the upper end.Click to EnlargeJust last week, TSLA stock once again bumped into the upper end of this range, where it thus far has been promptly rejected. Note also that the most recent ascent over the past couple of months has seen the stock rally from the lower end to the upper end of this range in a straight shot.This very fact makes a sustainable breakout above this range in the near-term most unlikely due to the stock's near- to intermediate-term overbought readings.Also, a sideways consolidation or possibly a mean-reversion move to the middle of the aforementioned trading range at this juncture looks likely.On the daily chart, we see that with Thursday's selling, TSLA stock not only broke below its steady, nearly three-month-long uptrend, but also below its 21-day simple moving average (yellow).Click to EnlargeNote also that the up-gap on Feb. 9 (blue arrow) was negated by yesterday's down-gap, thus also forming what we may refer to as an ""island top"" formation.Buy This Nvidia Corporation Dip for Free Right NowAll of these three developments are bearish for TSLA stock as it relates to the near to possibly intermediate-term. The path of least resistance now looks to point toward the $240 area as a next downside target.Traders and active investors could look to initiate short trading positions either through Tesla stock or its options.As always, any strong daily bullish reversal would be a stop-loss signal.Like what you see?

But, should Apple be successful with its effort, it opens the door to other litigation, not to mention emboldens a similar case being brought against Qualcomm by the Federal Trade Commission.The short version of the story: Apple (and the FTC and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, for that matter) are all arguing the same thing - Qualcomm's business model of licensing its technologies to phonemakers isnot only exorbitant, but unlawfully stifles competition. That's a legal no-no in most any country. The Korea Fair Trade Commission isseeking $873 million for essentially the same.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverFor the record, QCOM has lost this argument before. In 2015, thecompany forked over $975 million to Chinafor breaking that country's antitrust laws. Indeed, Qualcomm wasallegedly charging all-encompassing licensing feesto phonemakers that may or may not have needed access to all of the technology in that IP package… another dubious practice.Years of sharp dealing have finally caught up with Qualcomm.The GoodThe irony is, while the company was over-milking its aging patent portfolio, QCOM was also developing some new - and highly marketable - intellectual property.The idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) is an exciting one, but the reality is, the technology and bandwidth needed to meet the need just isn't ready, yet. Or, it wasn't anyway. This week, Qualcommunveiled its 802.11ax technology, which can carry four times the amount of data current Wi-Fi technology carries, but without using any more bandwidth.Qualcomm Technologies VP Rahul Patel explained:It is taking Wi-Fi to a new level from a user-experience point of view. What it is trying to do is prepare the Wi-Fi network, which in many cases is experiencing a lot of congestion, largely because the network is becoming dense and is not able to deal with the amount of traffic.At the same time, the company has created a whole new kind of RF ""front end,"" or the radio connection between a mobile phone's modem and the transceiver. Not only is it a superior solution to current alternatives, it's a simpler solution that works with a variety of connection protocols, such as LTE and MIMO, by the utilization of modem intelligence.They're not the kind of advances the average consumer cares about, or even understands. With 5G connectivity about to become the norm, however, these little advances are actually big advances that phonemakers will desperately need.Bottom Line for QCOM StockIn simplest terms, the future of QCOM stock lies somewhere between the two ends of this good/bad continuum. One way or another, sooner or later, Qualcomm's business model of leveraging an aging patent portfolio - and doing so in a questionable manner - is going to falter. If the company wants to continue being an IP player, it's going to need some new IP.The question is, will 802.11ax and new RF front-end platforms be enough? It matters, simply becausethe company's licensing and royalty revenue is roughly twice its revenue from outright chip sales.3 Stocks That Could Soar on a Short SqueezeThe answer to this question is a qualified yes; the qualification is the speed with which lawsuits will result in a decision, and the time that will be needed for IoT and 5G to reach critical mass. Odds are good the former will hurt before the latter helps, meaning Qualcomm could be headed for a dry spell, earnings-wise.Still, for the true long-termer who can stomach the ""in the meantime"" volatility, the market may start to appreciate the potential of the distant future now…after a few years of strong bearish pressure.QCOM stock may not be appropriate for grandma's retirement portfolio, but there's little doubt the company's new technologies will be crucial to the next generation of connectivity.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Tesla, Inc: Likely to Raise Capital Soon;2/23/2017;"DuringTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday   afternoon, management said it will likely raise more capital this   year. A capital raise would extend Tesla's history of raising   capital through debt or equity every year.Tesla car factory. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();Reducing riskGoing into 2017, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had already hinted that   the company could raise capital ahead of Model 3. In the   company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said the Model 3   didn't look like it would ""require"" a capital raise, but the CEO   was also careful to emphasize that this didn't mean Tesla   shouldn't tap into debt or equity opportunities in order to help   create ""a larger buffer and to derisk the business.""But a capital raise appears all but certain now, based on   Musk's comments during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call   on Wednesday.[T]his is really a question of, 'What's the risk tolerance     of the company, or how close to the edge do we want to go?'     According to our financial plan, capital needs to be raised for     the Model 3, but we get very close to the edge. So, then that's     probably not the best thing for shareholders on a risk-adjusted     basis. So, we're considering a number of options, but I think     it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk.A capital raise in 2017 comes after the company had indicated   in August in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission   related to its acquisition of SolarCity that it was planning to   raise funds by the end of 2016, ""including through potential   equity or debt offerings.""The filing explained:Such additional funds would be used primarily for tooling,     production equipment and construction of the Tesla's Model 3     production lines, equipment to support cell production at     Tesla's Gigafactory, as well as new Tesla retail locations,     service centers and Supercharger locations and general     corporate purposes. Secondarily, if the Merger with SolarCity     is completed, a portion of the additional funds would also be     used to support the additional capital needs of the Combined     Company.With these same statements remained even in an Oct. 7 filing   with the SEC, investors assumed the company planned to raise   capital during the fourth quarter.But Tesla ended up deciding todelay a capital raiseas record fourth-quarter deliveries helped the company reporta rare profit, improving Tesla's cash position.In retrospect, if Tesla opts to raise capital through equity   instead of debt, delaying a capital raise looks like it will pay   off for shareholders by significantly mitigating shareholder   dilution.Tesla stockis up more than 30% since October.Image source: author.Big spending on the wayWhile Tesla's cash position improved again between the   company's third and fourth quarter, increasing by over $300   million to $3.4 billion, raising capital would make sense ahead   of the company's plans for aggressive spending ahead of Model 3.   Tesla said it plans to invest between $2 billion and $2.5 billion   in capital in the first half of 2017 as it prepares to bring   Model 3 to market in July. With $1.3 billion in capital   expenditures during the entire year of 2016, this represents a   significant jump in the pace of Tesla's capital spending.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Fell After Earnings;2/23/2017;"Shares of TeslaTSLAwere down more than 5% in morning trading Thursday after the company posted a wider-than-expected fourth quarter loss. Despite Elon Musk's assurance that his company's affordable Model 3 sedan is still on schedule, investors are remaining cautious about several other key things that Tesla revealed on Wednesday afternoon.Earnings PerformanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Tesla posted an adjusted loss of $1.25 per share, missing our estimate of a loss of $1.19 per share. Nevertheless, this figure was significantly improved from the year-ago quarter's loss of $2.44 per share.Tesla said that it delivered 22,252 cars in the quarter, which was down 10% from the third quarter but up about 27% year-over-year. The company saw 49% more global net orders for the Model S and Model X combined, and it expects to deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 of these cars in the first half of 2017. This would represent year-over-year growth of 61% to 71%, giving Tesla some strong momentum as it begins production on the Model 3 in July.(Also Read:Tesla Posts Strong Revenues Despite Q4 Loss, Global Net Orders Up 49%)Tesla also posted strong revenues, with fourth-quarter sales figures of $2.28 billion comfortably beating our consensus estimate of $2.201 billion and growing 88.4% year-over-year. The company benefitted from about six weeks of revenue from SolarCity, a solar energy services company is acquired in November.The Good, The Bad, The UglyAlthough Tesla's earnings inconsistency continues, its revenue beat and vehicle sales growth should be encouraging. The more optimistic Tesla investors will also cling to Elon Musk's latest updates regarding the production of the Model 3.As mentioned above, the Model 3 is slated to begin production in July, and the $35,000 car is expected to help move Tesla into a wider market that targets the average driver. Musk expects to make about half a million cars in 2018, and his expectations are based on the idea that improvements in manufacturing will help his company reach that goal.""The Model 3 is designed for manufacturing,"" Musk said. ""It's a very compelling car, and we understand manufacturing a lot better than we did in the past.""Of course, not everything was rainbows and butterflies for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Besides its earnings miss, investors are also punishing Tesla for its increased capital expenditures related to the Model 3.Musk did mention that the company does not actually need to raise more capital for the Model 3, but he did admit that things were ""very close to the edge"" and ""it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce the risk.""Investors are obviously hesitant about any new spending from Tesla, which seems to be perpetually burning cash on its new projects. The company also put some more uncertainty in the air with a separate announcement about a big changeup in management.According to a companyblog post, Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler will be departing the company in April. Tesla said that Wheeler, who joined the company about 15 months ago, is leaving to pursue opportunities in public policy.Wheeler will be replaced by Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's first ever CFO and a former FordFvehicle line controller. Ahuja already has about seven years of experience at Tesla, having maneuvered the company away from near bankruptcy in 2008.Bottom LineLong story short, I don't think we know much more about Tesla than we did before the release of the report. Sure, Musk reassured us that the Model 3 is on schedule, but investors have learned to take his time-based promises with a grain of salt.The big picture for Tesla is still the same. The company has the potential to change the world. But it burns lots of cash and profits seem a long way out.Stocks that Aren't in the News.

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChoosing between buyingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choice between value and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the value play, while GOOGL stock provides the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile Apple shares have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earnings ratio around 16, lower than what investors are paying for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cents per share, more than covered by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenues increased to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. This justifies a P/E of nearly 30. The shares are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investors prefer value over growth and Apple stock is doing better than Alphabet. But this isn't the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place, instead, it's more like picking between cookies and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have owned them for several years, and I have profited handsomely holding both.The Case for AAPL StockNo technology company is as adept at squeezing profit from hardware as Apple.While other smartphone companies struggle to make money, Apple regularly brings $1 of every $4 in iPhone sales to its bottom line. Its closed ecosystem is perceived as safe and their products last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe current case for Apple stock, however, has little to do with hardware. Instead,services now drivethe stock forward. Services like its app store - from which it takes a 30% cut of sales - Apple Music, iPay and iCloud have become huge, with $7.17 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter alone. The success of its services enabled Apple to become a power in the cloud by putting more than$12 billioninto capital spending last year. It's no secret that the cloud is a capital-intensive business, but Apple has been able to out-spend cloud rivals without disturbing its profit machine.AAPL hadover $246 billion in cashon its books at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut to encourage Apple to bring this cash back to the U.S. That's enough money to buy companies such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analysts subtract the Apple cash from its market cap, they find the company itself valued at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two times sales. If you're looking for a cheap value stock, poised for an era of unprecedented growth, with plenty of safety and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.The Case for GOOGL StockThe artists formerly known as Google have a different case to make.Alphabet has become acash flow monster, delivering nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow last year. Its revenue grew nearly 20%, and GOOGL's operating margin is over 25%.Clouds scale like no invention ever seen before, and Alphabet delivers a global search service for literally nothing. Its Android operating system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watches as customers who own them come to its services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL has also become a power in hardware. Its Chromebooks now outsell Apple's Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now participates in all the hardware markets pioneered by rivals - from virtual reality headsets to streaming devices - with watches and personal assistants that let you conduct searches of your home or the world with just your voice.Under CFO Ruth Porat, who joined the company fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is finally telling investors how much they're spending on ""other bets"" like robots and self-driving cars, and it's working to make money on those ventures.The Bottom LineIt's hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.The perceived threat to Alphabet is the growing balkanization of the Internet, with national governments seeking to control what people see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That has yet to impact GOOGL, but even the perception can hurt a stock.AAPL is currently benefiting from a global flight to safety. Its enormous cash position, its strength as a luxury brand, and its growth in services, which could easily be expanded into competition in the cloud with companies such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If pushed to the wall and forced to buy just one right now, I would probably go with GOOG, the non-voting version of Alphabet stock, which shares equally in earnings but sells at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both companies are likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) was in the 1950s,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) was in the last decade. These are their good old days. We know they will end someday, but that day is not today.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

The 30% buffer from current price gives this trade an 80% theoretical chance of success based on today's metrics. If successful, this trade yields over 15% on money risked.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.The Alternate Bet:A more aggressive trader can sell NVDA $65 put naked and collect $1.50 per contract. But by selling naked puts, I commit to owning the stock at that price if Nvidia stock falls through it.Usually I like to hedge my trades, but in this case I will refrain for now. I believe that the longer-dated aspect of this trade allows me the flexibility to manage the risk appropriately should more downside come. Defense strategies could include credit call spreads or cheap shorter-term debit put spreads.Conversely, someone who wants to be more bullish NVDA stock can use the proceeds from selling the credit put spreads to set another bullish trade.Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for FreeThe Juice (Optional):So, for example, I could buy the NVDA May $115/$120 debit call spread for 95 cents per contract to open. If Nvidia retests its highs, I stand to gain up to $4 per contract.I am not required to hold my NVDA options trades open through expiration. I can close any of them at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Once thought to be a good candidate for both T-Mobile andSprint Corp(NYSE:S), it appears as though T-Mobile has the inside track, which should hurt Sprint stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrOr does it?Negotiations are not taking place right now because competing bidders in the FCC's spectrum auction aren't allowed to communicate with each other, and won't be until the auction ends in the near future.Thus, any tie-up at the moment is pure fantasy - a game that Sprint stock analysts and media (including myself) seem all too ready to play.T-Mobile and DishT-Mobile CEO John Legere laid out the rationale for DISH seeking a wireless partner at the Consumer Electronics Show in early January.""Rumors for years that (Dish is) getting into wireless, it's a declining TV business and it has a big pile of spectrum. This is going to run its course in 2017,""Legere told the CES audience. ""By the end of 2017, Dish will not be a standalone entity. So dealer, next hand of cards. Charlie (Dish CEO Charlie Engren), thanks for playing.""Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.T-Mobile just deliveredstrong fourth-quarter profitsthat beat analyst expectations. Adding more than 8 million subscribers for the third consecutive year, four wireless carriers is proving to be good for consumers, making a T-Mobile/Sprint tie-up less likely to get approval from the Trump administration.So, DISH either saddles up to T-Mobile or Sprint.Wireless expert Mark Lowenstein believes that the wireless companies will ultimately need the cable companies as much as they currently need wireless.""Owning Charter will help Verizon's in 5G, and getting to a more critical mass in broadband homes provides Verizon with more options in a hybrid fixed/mobile broadband world,""Lowenstein recently wrote in FierceWireless. ""The worlds of cable and wireless will ultimately merge in some form.""Therefore, in his opinion (and I tend to agree), it makes perfect sense for T-Mobile to merge with Dish Network or Charter.However, given T-Mobile and Dish already had merger discussions back in 2015 - which failed due to valuation concerns - Legere and Engren are already familiar with each other and the sticking points from previous negotiations, making a deal more likely a second time around.Plus, ifVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is in fact interested in acquiringCharter Communications, Inc.(NASDAQ:CHTR), T-Mobile is less likely to be able to pull off such a deal even with the backing of parentDeutsche Telekom AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:DTEGY).T-Mobile and Dish would be more a merger of equals, if there was such a thing.Sprint Stock Could Be Left in the ColdThat leaves Sprint potentially out in the cold, an outcome that would absolutely kill Sprint stock, making Charter the natural partner, a move that could seeSoftbank Group Corp(OTCMKTS:SFTBF) founder Masayoshi Son become the largest shareholder in a combined entity.Currently, Softbank ownsowns 83% of Sprint, while over at Charter, John Malone'sLiberty Broadband Corp(NASDAQ:LBRDK)owns 25.6%.Sprint has a market value of $36.6 billion, while Charter's enterprise value is $99.1 billion; put the two together and Son's share of the merged company works out to 30.4%, compared to 25.4% for Liberty Broadband, despite Charter being the larger company.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThere's only one problem with this calculation: It doesn't provide a premium for either company, and that's where negotiations could get very tricky.John Malone knows a thing or two about dealmaking so he's likely to drive a hard bargain when it comes to whom owns whom. Meanwhile, Son could argue thatComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) is just ashungry for a wireless business- it has set up a mobile division and isbidding on spectrum- and could make a better fit, given its existing partnership with Sprint.At the end of the day, both Sprint and Charter need each other more than Comcast needs either of them, so unless something happens that prevents T-Mobile and DISH from coming together, Charter is the best bet for Sprint stock at this moment.However, that could change very quickly once the shoes start to drop.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Tied Hip-and-Thigh to TrumpThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postSprint Corp (S) Stock's Best Bet: Charter Communications, Inc.

Is SunPower Coming Up Roses in Residential Solar?;2/23/2017;"AmidSunPower Corporation's(NASDAQ: SPWR) struggles over the past year, including the   fourth quarter of 2016 in particular, the company may finally be   showing some promise in residential solar, a business long   dominated byTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) .Customers are now starting to shun the long-term contracts   that come with leases, choosing to pay cash or take out loans for   their solar systems. And when they begin to make their own   choices about solar equipment, SunPower's high efficiency,   superior quality, and good aesthetics have led to rising market   share. Which of course begs the question: Is this a sustainable   win that SunPower can build off for years to come?Image source: SunPower.makeArticleAd();Why SunPower is different in residential solarSunPower has a few key differentiators from installers like   Tesla, Vivint, and Sunrun. The first is that it sells through a   dealer network rather than doing sales and installation directly.   That means SunPower can sell a dealer panels, complete solutions   like Equinox, and lease financing, or any combination of the   three. It has also built out loan partners, allowing dealers to   offer lease, loan, and cash sales, whereas national competitors   still have an incentive to push customers to leases.The second differentiation is SunPower's high efficiency solar   panels. The X-Series solar panel now averages 25% efficiency on a   cell level, meaning panels are likely 23%-23.5% efficient,   exceeding even high efficiency competitors by 300 basis points or   more.The Equinox solution, which includes micro inverters and   racking, is also a differentiator, making it more cost effective   to install X-Series panels. And there's growing evidence that   SunPower's strategy is winning.Evidence SunPower is winningThe past year has been really terrible for most residential   solar companies. Sales have been harder to come by and the market   has transitioned away from national installers and leases to   smaller installers and loans or cash sales. But that plays into   SunPower's hands, and the company says it's now in the #2   position in the residential solar market.The moves to smaller installers, away from leases, and toward   higher efficiency all play in SunPower's favor. And that should   lead to growing sales and continued strong margins, which   management said were around 20% when you pull out one-time   restructuring charges.What comes nextThe interesting dynamic heading into 2017 is that customers   are moving toward local and regional installers, but battery   systems are going to become more common on the market. And the   development and smart controls behind a battery system will   require a large company to drive the economic benefits batteries   can bring.This could put SunPower in an enviable position, supplying   products and technology to local and regional installers while   still having the ability to control energy storage at a corporate   level, creating virtual power plants or individualized charge and   discharge cycles depending on local rate structures. These are   capabilities Tesla and Sunrun are starting to offer, but they   come with their own installation infrastructure and don't give   customers the same equipment or financing choice as SunPower's   dealer network.It's possible that SunPower could be well positioned in energy   storage as well, although it hasn't released a full strategy   given the small size of the market. But if it does, residential   solar could go from a point of strength within the business to a   driver of value for the company long-term.What to watch forIf the strategy I laid out above is a real winner for   SunPower, we should see MW deployed in residential solar rise,   revenue from residential solar grow, and margins remain over 20%   and potentially trend higher over time.Given the fact this is the one bright spot for earnings right   now, it's very possible management will be able to leverage   residential solar growth in the future. That's the surest way to   get back to profitability given the challenges in commercial and   utility markets lately.10 stocks we like better than SunPowerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Tied Hip-and-Thigh to Trump;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNo stock you can buy today is more closely tied to the fate of the Trump Administration thanExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM).makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Since the November election its CEO has been whisked off to become Secretary of State, while the company he left behind has doubled-down on policies aligned with those of the new Administration.Thismakes Exxon a must-own, according to some analysts. ""It is hard to imagine a better scenario"" for Exxon than a Trump administration, writes Martin Tiller of Oilprice.If Tiller is right, XOM stock is a bargain at below $83 per share, its opening price on Feb. 15. The 75 cents per share dividend delivers a yield of 3.62% and the future should be looking bright.The price is low because of a recent earnings miss but the shortfall was mainly due to a one-time write-off of natural gas assets. Exxon plans to boost spending.Betting on More Oil and GasExxon Mobil is taking the administration's call to increase production seriously. Its$6.6 billion purchaseof Permian Basin assets controlled by the Bass Family means it should be able to deliver oil profitably for 20 years to come, at current prices.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsThe company is also moving ahead globally, benefiting fromthe end of a rulethat made companies disclose foreign bribes.Exxon is a big player in Iraq, and Tillerson may be the only person alive who can make that work, getting around the Administration's travel ban and Trump's comments that the U.S. should have seized the country's oil in 2003 when it had the chance.Shareholders have also approved XOM'spurchase ofInteroil, a producer of oil and gas off Papua New Guinea, with a lot of undeveloped acreage and one of the region's biggest gas finds that is already producing.This should leverage the company even more than it has been to the price of oil, which has risen from about $45 per barrel to $53 since Trump's election. Natural gas is also flirting with a three-handle, or $3 per mcf, after trading closer to $2 per mcf last November.Target on Its BackThere remain big risks for Exxon Mobil bulls. Exxon's big bets have put a target on its back, highlighted by the resignation of environmentalist Sarah Labowitz from a company advisory board. The company has responded to the threat by naming a climate scientist, Susan Avery, to its board of directors but that will not be enough for its opponents.Exxon also faces the perennial risk of having too much of a good thing.Just as its gains are leveraged to rising oil prices, overproduction could cause the stock's price to fall. Add to that the natural risks attendant to owning refineries, and the present bargain in Exxon Mobil stock may not last.The Bottom Line on XOM StockI would be more attracted investing in Exxon Mobil stock if the Trump Administration's month-plus record so far didn't read more likea Carl Hiassen novelthan a Tom Clancy one.The company has enormous potential but it cuts both ways. The shares now sell for little more than they did in 2007. While the dividend has doubled, revenues have continued to decline for the last three years.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.If we are on the cusp of a new oil boom, XOM stock will be a prime beneficiary. It's well positioned to profit from even $53 per barrel oil. But how long will the good times last as costs for renewable energy continue to fall, making it harder for developing nations to justify the infrastructure investment needed to make oil and gas look cheap by comparison?Exxon Mobil may be a good trade, and it may have a few good years ahead of it, but the longer-term looks cloudy and Trump won't be president forever.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJust think ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) as a Rorschach test. You know - the pictures of random ink blots psychiatrists show you to see what your subconscious mind's got going on. See, if you wanted to see TSLA stock in a bearish light, you could do that. Or, if you wanted to see it in a bullish light, the Tesla earnings report posted Wednesday evening could just as easily facilitate that stance.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FlickrThere was good and bad in it.Most of the market chose to see the glass as half empty for TSLA stock, by the way, with shares in the red to the tune of over 5% early on Thursday.Nevertheless, even today's naysayers have to acknowledge there were some encouraging glimmers of hope nestled in last quarter's numbers.Tesla Stock Earnings for Q4For the quarter ending in December, Teslareported an operating loss of 69 cents per shareon revenue of $2.28 billion. Analysts were only calling for a top line of $2.19 billion, but those same analysts were also calling for a loss of only 43 cents per share of TSLA stock.The comparison to the fourth-quarter figures from the prior year are similarly split. In the same quarter a year earlier, Teslalost $2.02 per shareon revenue of $1.21 billion.Of course, adding to the fog that obscured the company's true health is the fact thatthe $2.6 billion acquisitionof loss-making SolarCity was officially closed in late November, adding to Tesla's top line, but subtracting from the bottom line. The Tesla earnings report explained that the solar power outfit added $77 million worth of cash to the books, but also added $85 million in expenses.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowStill, the post-acquisition picture is a blurry one, with the root cause of the swing back to a loss after Q3's profit not necessarily being solely attributable to the SolarCity deal. Even the official SEC filing only offers modest details in broad categorizations ""automotive,"" ""energy generation and storage"" and ""services and other.""TSLA Highlight/LowlightsWhile details were minimal, it's worth noting gross margins for the energy generation and storage division swungfrom -4.1% in the third quarter to 2.7% for the fourth quarter, while gross margins for the automotive arm - on a GAAP basis - shrunk from 29.4% in Q3 to only 22.6% in Q4. The gross margin rate on services flipped from a positive 4.8% to a negative 11.3% during the quarter.All the changes in margin figures reflect the fact that this is a company in transition from being one thing to being something else, and something much bigger than it was - hence the challenge in finding meaning in the quarterly report.All the same, cars remain Tesla's core business, accounting for $1.99 billion worth of last quarter's $2.28 billion in revenue. It sold a total of 22,252 vehicles last quarter, down from 24,821 deliveries during the third quarter. It made, though, 24,882 electric cars during Q4, versus 25,185 completed assemblies for Q3. All those figures were far and away better than year-ago levels.Preparation and reconfiguration for the Model 3 may have been a production distraction … and not a cheap one. The companyincurred $522 million in CapEx last quarter, most of which was spent on preparations for Model 3 production.Cash flow went negative to the tune of $236 million during the fourth quarter.Looking Ahead for TSLA StockOne of those sources of the aforementioned expansion will be, of course, the launch of the Model 3 - the electric car for the masses sporting a sticker price of only $35,000. CEO Elon Musk had previously said the company intends to begin production of the vehicle in July, and reach its maximum output pace of 5,000 of the cars per week during the fourth quarter of this year.Musk reiterated that timeframeon Wednesday.In the meantime, the company expects to deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 electric vehicles during the first half of 2017 following a record number of orders for the Model S and Model 3 received during the last quarter of last year. Tesla didn't offer any revenue or earnings guidance.How to Trade Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock for 150% UpsideThe company did, however, answer a question many shareholders has silently asking themselves - yes,Tesla is apt to issue more debt or more TSLA stock to raise funds. Musk said the organization could likely afford not to, but doing so presents a potential liquidity risk. The news of the likely fundraising is probably the biggest reason TSLA stock fell in the wake of last quarter's earnings report.More than anything though, owning Tesla stock remains an adventure in gauging how traders willfeelabout the rhetoric, as the results continue to tell us little about the future health of the company.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWeibo Corp (ADR) (WB) Stock Goes Cold Despite Hot Q4 Earnings7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings.

Tax Reform by August? The Market Abides;2/23/2017;"Thursday, February 23, 2017makeArticleAd();The Dow keeps on rolling, now for nine straight days worth of gains. Lately, we'd seen pre-market activity try to pump the brakes a bit, opening normal trading days slightly to the negative or right around break-even. But the animal spirits would eventually return again, continually posting all-time highs. It's been a good time to be a market bull.Futures look stronger early Thursday than they have earlier in the week, bolstered by another healthy Jobless Claims report. Also, an interview CNBC gave to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin this morning illustrated the Trump administration's concentrated interest on passing tax reform through Congress. Mnuchin established a timeline - before the August recess - to enact pro-business tax reform measures that promise to be the most significant since the Reagan administration.Less clear were the issues regarding border taxes and what the Treasury expects to do about a strengthening dollar in the global economy, which looks to cut into U.S. competitiveness. But an August timetable for tax reform - which has already been at least somewhat priced into the market - is proving to have a positive effect on today's early trading.Initial Jobless Claims rose by 6000 last week from the previous week to a still-strong 244K. For the past few weeks we've seen another ratcheting down in jobless claims, from the 250-275K we saw for much of 2016 to perhaps a 225-250K for the near future. Continuing claims fell from 2.08 million two weeks ago to 2.06 million last week, also historically low though still slightly above the 2 million mark we saw briefly not too long ago. More good news.Fed minutes seem to indicate more willingness to raise interest rates another quarter point at the FOMC's March meeting, but the jury is still out. Jobs numbers of late show a labor market tightening, so if we see economic data pointing to stronger inflation metrics, this will probably boost the likelihood of a March hike even further. If not, then not. But even a range of 75-100 basis points wouldn't throw a wet blanket on this hot market, at least not too much.Tesla MotorsTSLAmissed Q4 estimates after yesterday's close, but orders are way up - nearly 50% - for Model S and Model X cars. And the Model 3, Tesla's least expensive sedan with a price tag of $35K, remains on track for a July launch, which should bolster company revenues, which did surpass expectations in Q4.For more on Tesla's earnings report, check here.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Has Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Finally Hit the Bottom?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf there was ever a company that needs good news, and good newsnow, it would beFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT). Immediately after its introduction to the retail market, FIT made a pronounced impact on the health and wellness sector. More importantly, it became a cultural phenomenon thanks to the company's quirky advertisements. But in the financial markets, Fitbit stock has lacked.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitSure, Wall Street piled into Fitbit stock during its initial public offering honeymoon phase. Between June 18 until Aug. 5 of 2015, FIT stock gained an extremely impressive 74%. Unfortunately, that only covers 34 trading days. Since then, Fitbit stock has become the antithesis of its consumer base: lethargic, unmotivated and … well, something that rhymes with ""FIT.""But with the once on-fire consumer tech firm releasing its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 results, will fortune shine on Fitbit stock?Just by looking at the hard numbers, I wouldn't hold my breath.Tough Earnings for Fitbit to SwallowFitbit reported aQ4 lossof $146.3 million. Although the fact that FIT went into the red wasn't a surprise, the magnitude certainly was. On a per share basis, Fitbit stock was expected by Wall Street analysts to mitigate negativity to 48 cents. Instead, losses adjusted for one-time gains and costs resulted in 56 cents of red ink.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe top line didn't impress, either. For Q4, forecasted revenue averaged $575.8 million. In actuality, FIT stock managed $573.8 million, or a negative surprise of a little more than 0.3%. The margin of the miss isn't so bad in and of itself. However, with so many critics taking aim at Fitbit stock, the company needed something spectacular on this front. Whatever this is, it just isn't going to do the trick.Although it's not fair, the Fitbit earnings miss is exaggerated due to the fact that it's the first one. According toCNBC's archives, prior to yesterday's earnings report, the device maker leveraged an averageearnings surpriseof 103%.One of the most prominent criticisms came from Jim Cramer. Appearing on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" segment late last month, Cramer suggested that FIT was acommoditized company. Once people buy the product, there is no compelling reason to buy again. And when you consider the sharp erosion in sales growth, it's hard not to see this point.To illustrate, quarter-over-quarterrevenue growthin 2015 was 170%. In 2016, it has dropped to an alarming 25%!Since they're not killing it on profitability margins, FIT has drastic actions to take. At least to that end, management is making the right moves.Easing the Minds of Fitbit Stock BuyersLast month, FIT announced aseries of layoffs, which will affect about 10% of the total workforce. The tech firm is hoping to save $200 million, which is a huge deal for its size.We also have to reconsider this criticism of Fitbit stock as a ""commoditized"" investment. It's both a valid and an invalid argument. You can literally say the same thing aboutApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE). That hasn't stopped them from making smart phones, tablets and cameras. The latter is a particularly good example of a widely distributed product continuing to find solid demand.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is Making a Giant Push in Its Supercharger NetworkIt shouldn't come as no surprise that we live in a disposable world. Many of us couldn't fathom driving the same car for more than three or four years. As long as FIT stock remains an innovation investment first, I don't care about ancillary titles like commoditized.And the company has a strong user base. Build those numbers, and Fitbit Inc can turn that frown upside down.Finally, there is something to be said about hitting rock bottom. Fitbit is sitting at breakeven despite what otherwise was apretty lousy reportthat also included negative guidance.The bearishness seems completely priced in. I'm not guaranteeing a floor, but there are enough positives for Fitbit stock to begin recovering from here.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:Bull of the Day:Xcerra (NASDAQ:XCRA-Free Report) just pulled off a triple play of sorts. The company reported earnings and beat on top, beat on bottom and raised guidance. I love to see stocks beat and raise as these stocks tend to outperform for the next several months. Normally when I see a stock beat and raise, it becomes a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), but this stock already held the coveted Rank before the report. Now it is the Bull of the Day.Recent Earnings ReportXCRA beat the Zacks Consensus of a loss of $0.02 by $0.08 when they reported a gain of $0.06 for the most recent quarter. Revenues came in at $80.1M and that was ahead of the $78.9M estimate and represented growth of 10.8% from year ago levels.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1Company DescriptionXcerra Corporation engages in designing, manufacturing, and marketing automatic test equipment for the semiconductor industry. Its product portfolio includes Diamond platform; X-Series platform; and ASL platform. The Company also offers various services, such as installation and maintenance of test systems, servicing of spare parts, parts and labor warranties on test systems and instruments, and training on the maintenance and operation of test systems. Xcerra Corporation, formerly known as LTX-Credence Corporation, is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts.Guiding HigherThe company said the next three months are going to be better than what was previously expected. They guided EPS to a range of $0.10 - $0.14 compared to an $0.08 estimate. Revenues are expected to be $95M - $99M compared to the $89.75M estimate.Further, in the press release the company noted they plan to ship a record number of Diamondx systems during the current quarter.EstimatesThe beat is pretty fresh and all the reports are clearly not in yet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is holding still at $0.22 as is the estimate for 2018 at $0.56.To me, this means that estimates have not yet moved and we could be in for a big surprise.Bear of the Day:Aaron's (NYSE:AAN-Free Report) recently beat the Wall Street estimate when the company reported earnings on February 17. The company earned $0.50 per share and that was $0.05 ahead of the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.45.Revenues came in at $795M, down 3.2% from the year ago period and below the consensus estimate of $814.8M.Taken together, the revenue miss and earnings beat would probably be a forgivable sin and it certainly would not make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). So why did the Rank fall?GuidanceThe company guided Wall Street below its expectations, and that means that estimates are going to fall. The company said they expect FY2017 EPS of between $2.15 - $2.40 when Wall Street was looking for $2.46.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 slipped from $2.47 to $2.28 over the last seven days and there was also a big move lower for the 2018 number. It moved from $2.80 to $2.68.Not all the estimates are in yet, with a few analysts yet to report back. This could mean that estimates move lower from their already beaten up position.Company DescriptionAaron's is engaged in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories. It is engaged in the lease ownership, lease and retail sale of a variety of products, such as widescreen and LCD televisions, computers, living room and bedroom furniture, and refrigerators The company offers products of various brands, such as JVC, Mitsubishi, Philips, Panasonic, Sony, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Simmons, Frigidaire, and Sharp. Aaron's, Inc. is based in Atlanta, Georgia.Closing StoresThe company noted that they closed 61 stores in the fourth quarter of 2016. On top of that they also see another 70 stores to close in 2Q17. Logically, the lower number of stores could lead to lower sales in the future.Guidance for sales was inline, with the company projecting $3.1B - $3.31B when the Wall Street Estimate was calling for $3.26B.Efficiency better increase per store if AAN is going to meet the sales goals.Additional content:Tesla Posts Strong Revenues Despite Q4 Loss, Global Net     Orders Up 49%Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)just released its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results, posting earnings, before non-recurring items, of a loss of $1.25 per share and revenues of $2.28 billion.

Will Driverless Cars End Traditional Car Ownership?;2/23/2017;"I bought a used car recently, and a few days after I brought   it home, a friend asked me, ""Do you think this is the last car   you'll ever buy?""We talk a lot about self-driving cars, so I knew exactly where   he was going with his question. He was hinting at the   fact that both autonomous car technologies and ride-sharing   services are advancing so quickly that by the time I'd be in   the market for another vehicle, I might not actually need to buy   one.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();By 2035, the IHS estimates there will be 76 million cars on   the road worldwide with some level of autonomy.Even now, semi-autonomous cars that can keep themselves in   their lanes, automatically brake in emergency situations, and   slow down to match the speed of the car in front of themcan be purchasedfor as little as $20,000.And as genuinely driverless cars get cheaper and become   ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthly car payments and   opt-in to a monthly mileage subscription service instead.Automakers are investing in this futureTo understand how it's possible that we could soon live in a   world where most people don't own cars, we need to look no   further than what the automakers themselves are doing.Elon Musk's recently updated version ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA)  master plan includes details on a new   service: When the company's vehicles become fully autonomous (by   2018 or 2019, according to Musk), Tesla owners will be able to   allow their vehicles to drive themselves around and be rented out   by other people.As Musk wrote:You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared     fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have     it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation,     significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the     monthly loan or lease cost.Image source: Tesla.Musk also said that Tesla would deploy its own fleet of   driverless vehicles for rent in areas where there was more demand   for Tesla vehicles than privately owned cars could meet, so that    ""you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you   are."" Remember, this isn't the catchphrase of a taxi company, nor   even a ride-hailing service -- but rather the direction where   Musk sees his automaker headed.And just in case think this mentality is unique to the   innovative Tesla, consider whatGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM)  is doing. The giant automaker launched a   ride-sharing service last year called Maven, which allows some GM   owners to rent out their vehicles when they're not in use. The   cars don't drive themselves yet, but the company sees it as a   first step toward a future where people are less inclined to own   cars.In a press release at the time, GM said that more than 25   million of its customers around the world will use some form of   shared mobility by 2020, and describe Maven as ""a key element of   our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive   industry."" Maven has spread to 17 cities across North America in   just 11 months, has 22,000 members, and has been used for 57   million miles of driving.Not to be outdone,Ford(NYSE: F) has launched i ts own ride-sharing service, and is   developing autonomous cars just like GM. Ford has made it clear   that it intends to launch a ""high-volume"" driverless car paired   with ride-hailing and ride-sharing services by 2021. The   company is already testing 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrids in   several states, and plans to triple the number of test vehicles   this year.Other automakers are moving in this direction as well.Fiat Chrysler(NYSE: FCAU) is working withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to test a fleet of 100   self-driving minivans that will be the basis for aride-hailing serviceset to launch later this year. It's still unclear what the   service will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critical   role in it, but what is clear is that the automaker believes in   the viability of Waymo's cars-as-a-service goal.Will this really end car ownership?It's hard to answer this question conclusively, of course.   After all, most people haven't even seen a fully autonomous   vehicle on the road, let alone ridden in one.But John Zimmer, the co-founder and president of   ride-hailing company Lyft,believes thatby 2025 ""private car ownership will all-but end in major U.S.   cities."" Lyft expects the majority of its vehicles to be   self-driving by 2021, and rival Uber is testing similar   strategies as well.Others have set similar timelines for the demise of car   ownership. Georg Bauer, who has held executive positions at   Daimler, BMW, and TeslatoldBusiness Insiderlast year that he thinks car ownership could be dead within   five to 10 years.Government regulations and our own apprehension about giving   up control over our vehicles may preserve the widespread car   ownership culture for longer than some expect. But what's crystal   clear is that tech companies and automakers alike are betting on   an automotive future that looks very different than today. Like   many things, the transition from owning cars to renting   driverless ones on an as-needed basis will likely occur in stages   -- but let's be clear, things are certainly moving in this   direction. And I, for one, would welcome a world without car   payments.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is Making a Giant Push in Its Supercharger Network;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has already run into issues with congestion at Supercharger locations. There are also areas of the country where charge stations are few and far between. With the affordable Model 3 on track to go into mass production in September, what is now an annoyance to customers could quickly become a real problem.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTesla is getting ahead of the issue by accelerating the growth of its Supercharger network, with plans to double the number of North American Supercharger locations in 2017.Tesla's Supercharger Network Is Critical to EVs' SuccessTransitioning from gasoline-fueled automobiles to electric cars isn't just a matter of convincing consumers to spend a little more on the initial purchase price. The technology, green cred and especially the potential long-term fuel savings go a long way toward overcoming any initial sticker shock.The big problem is range anxiety.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsRegular drivers don't worry about running out of gas because there is a vast network of gas stations across the country. With an estimated150,000 gas stations in the U.S.(in 2015), you are seldom more than a few minutes away from being able to refuel. Once there, it's typically five or 10 minutes to gas up, pay and be back on the road.Electric cars like those made by TSLA have the advantage of being able to be charged at home, but that takes a long time. According to Tesla's figures, half an hour on a home charger gets about 27 miles of driving range. And that doesn't help when you're traveling.The company has been building up a Supercharger network that takes on the role of gas stations. A Supercharger is capable of adding 270 miles of driving range in 30 minutes, and can fully charge a Tesla Model S with 90 kWh battery in roughly 75 minutes.Each Supercharger location isestimated to cost TSLA between $100k and $175kto build, taking 12-20 weeks to complete.TSLA Will Double Its North American Locations in 2017Tesla's Supercharger network has two challenges.First, it is much, much thinner than the nation's network of gas stations. In all of the U.S. Canada and Mexico,Tesla currently has just 373 Supercharger locations, with 2,636 connections. Many of those Supercharger locations are concentrated on the east and west coasts.Then there is the charging time. While filling your car with enough gas to go 500 miles might take five or 10 minutes, fully charging a base Model S takes 75 minutes.With Tesla ownership limited to early adopters with relatively deep pockets, the sparse Supercharger network has mostly been an annoyance - something Tesla owners learn to work around. With the Model 3 slated to go into production in September and kick off a wave of mass market Tesla ownership, those annoyances risk becoming a serious problem.Early adopters may be willing to work around challenges, but average consumers quickly turn against a product that requires them to jump through hoops.In its full-year 2016 update letter to investors,TSLA announced that is tackling the issue:""We plan to accelerate expansion of the Supercharger network this year, starting with doubling our number of North American Supercharger locations in 2017.""Expansion and New Charging PoliciesDoubling the number of North American Supercharger locations helps to address range anxiety by filling in some of those areas on the map that are currently blank. Since each location has multiple Superchargers, it also significantly expands the number of Tesla cars that can be charging at any given time.Tesla can't do much about the time needed to charge one of its cars - at least with current technology - but it has implemented several policies in the past few months to help deal with congestion at its Supercharger network.Weibo Corp (ADR) (WB) Stock Goes Cold Despite Hot Q4 EarningsIn December,TSLA announced an idle fee(billed by the minute) would be charged to Tesla owners who parked their vehicles at Superchargers and left them connected. Then in January it announced theend of unlimited free Supercharger accessfor new Tesla buyers going forward.Withclose to 400,000 of the $35k Model 3s pre-ordered- and a goal of producing 500k electric vehicles a year by 2018 - the pressure is on TSLA to ensure its Supercharger network can meet the coming flood of demand. The policy changes will help, but ultimately Tesla needs to expand its network of chargers to provide the coverage and availability drivers expect.Doubling the number of North American Supercharger locations this year will be costly, but is a necessary move for Tesla to go mass market.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ): Short the Titans of Tech;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rally inPowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) has reached epic proportions as the tech rally moves relentlessly higher on a daily basis. Like all good things, however, it will eventually come to an end. And the end is nigh for the Nasdaq. I expect QQQ to have a meaningful pullback over the coming few weeks.makeArticleAd();QQQ is comprised of the top 100 Nasdaq stocks, with the largest five holdings comprising nearly 40% of the index. These are the heavyweights of tech, with names likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).While the valuations given to AMZN and FB have always been rich (or perhaps absurd), now even Apple, the biggest component of the QQQ, is no longer the value stock is was a year ago. AAPL currently sports a price-to-earnings multiple over 16, by far the highest over the past year.Click to EnlargeYear-to-date, the QQQ is up a stunning 10%. To put that in a different context, if the Q's maintained the torrid pace of the rally, it would end up the year with a gain of 97.8%. Of the 34 trading days this year, QQQ has been up 27 days and down only seven.In February, there have been 12 up days and only two down days, with the two down days only being 11 cents and 4 cents.Certainly might be difficult to sustain that type of pace going forward.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe Q's are by far the most overbought in the past two years with a 14-day RSI reading over 85. Readings at these extremes are rare indeed, especially for an index or ETF.Click to EnlargeImplied volatility (IV) is priced at the lowest levels over that time frame, meaning option prices are cheap, trading at only 4%. Yesterday saw notable put trading in the QQQ, with an inordinate amount of put selling. This type of action is usually indicative of tops in the underlying shares.So with the Q's at grossly overbought levels and with option prices dirt cheap, taking a bearish position using long put options makes a lot of sense.QQQ Trade IdeaBuy QQQ March $130 puts at $1.50 or better.These are the at-the-money puts and cost only 1.1% the price of the QQQ. With IV at low levels, gamma is high, meaning these options are poised to move. A mere 2% pullback over the coming few weeks would result in a doubler for these options.Those wishing to defray some of the exposure could elect to sell shorter-term weekly options against the long traditional Mar $130 puts.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Inc. Earnings: Sales Soar, and Model 3 Is Coming;2/22/2017;"Expectations were high ahead ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter earnings report, with investors   particularly eager to get an update on the company's important   upcoming Model 3. In the three months leading up to the results,Tesla stocksoared about 51%.Tesla's fourth-quarter report seems to deliver on high   expectations, with the company reporting strong growth across its   business and management providing an optimistic update on Tesla's   important Model 3 program.Image source: author.makeArticleAd();Here's what investors should know about the report.The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016Q4 2015ChangeRevenue$2.3 billion$1.2 billion88%Automotive revenue$2.0 billion$1.1 billion79%EPS($0.78)($2.44)$1.66Non-GAAP EPS($0.69)($2.02)$1.33Vehicle production24,88214,03777%Data source: Tesla fourth-quartershareholder letter. Table by author.The resultsTesla's 88% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter revenue   was driven primarily by a 79% jump in the company's automotive   business, as vehicle production and deliveries climbed 77% and   27% year over year, respectively.Notably, Tesla's reported revenue benefited from the inclusion   of six weeks of SolarCity's operations, since the solar company   was acquired in November.While losses narrowed year over year, the company's Jan.   3-reported ""short-term production challenges"" associated with its   transition to new Autopilot hardware for its vehicles in Q4   weighed on deliveries and made it impossible for Tesla to sustain   the profitability it achieved in Q3. The company delivered 22,400   vehicles -- about 3,000 below its initial guidance and down from   24,821 deliveries in the third quarter of 2016.What management had to sayTesla was optimistic about Model 3, saying it was on plan for   the initial production of the $35,000 vehicle in July and volume   production in September. Further, Tesla said it expects Model 3   production to ""exceed 5,000 vehicles per week at some point in   the fourth quarter and 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in   2018.""Model 3. Image source: Tesla.https://teslamotors.app.box.com/v/pressfiles/1/7248453397Also, Model S and Model X seem to remain in high demand ahead   of Model 3. Tesla said fourth-quarter Model S and X orders   reached a record high, increasing 49% year over year.Tesla said its integration of SolarCity's operations is going   well, stating that the company is ""on track to generate $500M in   cash (including growth of non-recourse project financing) by 2019   and achieve the cost synergies we committed to upon acquiring   SolarCity."" To meet that goal, Tesla is taking the ax to   SolarCity's high advertising expenses and will be selling solar   products at Tesla stores. In addition, Tesla will continue   shifting SolarCity's system sales away from leasing.Tesla provided more details on how it is already on track with   this target:As evidence that we are on plan, our solar operations added     $77 million of cash during the six weeks following the close of     the acquisition, with 28% of solar capacity deployed during Q4     sold rather than leased, up from 13% sold in Q3, and up from     less than 4% sold in Q4 2015.For guidance, the company opted to refrain from a full-year   outlook, focusing instead on the first half of the year.We expect to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X     vehicles combined in the first half of 2017, representing     vehicle delivery growth of 61% to 71% compared with the same     period last year. In addition, both GAAP and non-GAAP     automotive gross margin should recover in Q1 to Q3 2016 levels     and then continue to expand in Q2 2017.Further, Tesla says it expects to invest about $2 billion to   $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ""ahead of Model 3   production.""10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Mobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've long thoughtMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) is too expensive. Mobileye has an interesting opportunity in driver assistance, and eventually, autonomous driving. But it also has intense competition from companies ranging fromNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Tier 1 suppliers likeDelphi Automotive PLC(NYSE:DLPH) andAutoliv Inc.(NYSE:ALV). But I haven't shorted MBLY stock - yet - and I hardly thought Mobileye's fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday presented an opportunity.makeArticleAd();Source:U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv via FlickrAfter all, MBLY is a story stock, and the story looked strong heading into Mobileye earnings. A series of deals and partnerships announced in the past few weeks led MBLY stock up 35% from late December lows. Optimism around autonomous driving and increasing automotive technology continues to rise; there's a reasonTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is near all-time highs. Betting against that in the short-term seemed foolish.That story appears to hold for a little while longer, as Mobileye earnings out Wednesday morning came in ahead of consensus estimates and the company's own guidance. In response, MBLY stock reversed from modest gains to modest losses back to 2%-plus gains again in premarket trading. That seems to imply that investors already are looking forward.But it's there the Mobileye story might have some holes.Mobileye Earnings Look SolidMobileye earnings for Q4 beat both Street consensus and its own guidance on the top and bottom line. Revenue of $104.6 million, in particular, looks impressive. MBLY had guided for roughly $96 million coming out of Q3 in moving expectations to the high end of a full-year $344 million-$350 million range. Heading into the earnings report, analysts largely backed those projections.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe beat, then, implies growth roughly 11 points higher than thought, with revenue growing almost 46% year-over-year.The driver (no pun intended) appears to be aftermarket sales. Those sales - largely dash-mounted systems on existing cars, rather than installed systems in new cars - increased 156% year-over-year. MBLY management had raised full-year projections for that division after Q2 to 20% of total sales. In fact, Q4 Mobileye earnings show the aftermarket drove 23% of full-year revenue, with sales increasing 113% for full-year 2016.Earnings per share beat consensus and implied guidance by 2 cents, which implies that profit margins were roughly as expected. The reason likely is that aftermarket sales offer lower gross margins, and thus aren't quite as profitable. MBLY has improved gross margins in the business, but mix seems like the most significant reason why the company didn't better leverage sales growth.Long-Term Questions Remain for MBLY StockThe fact that the revenue beat came from aftermarket growth isn't quite the outcome that Mobileye stock bulls would have preferred for Q4.The exciting business here is in OEM, from both the standpoint of market opportunity and profit margins. While 113% growth for aftermarket sales is nothing to sneeze at, it's still off a rather small base. And $82 million in aftermarket sales for 2016, on its own, isn't near enough to support a stock with an enterprise value over $10 billion.That seems to mean investors are looking forward. 2017 guidance on the conference call is for EPS of $1.01-$1.05 and revenue of $490 million-$505 million. Earnings appear just shy of analyst estimates of $1.04, while revenue of $490 million-$505 million suggests an outperformance to Street expectations of $491 million.That combination, however, means margins will be a bit lower than forecast by analysts. That, in turn, likely comes from a higher-than-expected proportion of aftermarket revenue - again, not what the bulls necessarily wanted to hear.And that may be enough for some of the long-term concerns to enter the narrative in MBLY stock in post-earnings trading.Looking ForwardMorgan Stanley downgraded Mobileye stock at the beginning of the month based on margin concerns - a move that took MBLY stock down 3%. And the ability of Mobileye to maintain margins is a big concern of mine, longer-term.I'm still skeptical that any semiconductor company can hold pricing (and thus margins) longer-term. One of the few exceptions, of course, is Nvidia itself. But Mobileye stock, now trading at ~45x 2017 EPS, still is priced higher than NVDA, and part of Nvidia's huge gains over the past year have come from optimism over prospects for its Drive PX 2 platform.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsThat platform is what Tesla turned to after its relationship ended with Mobileye (and somewhat acrimoniously). That decision alone illustrates the long-term challenges. Competition will be intense, and pricing will be too. It's important to remember that MBLY is a semiconductor company (though it has software capabilities, admittedly) and an automotive supplier. Neither industry traditionally gets very high earnings multiple, because both businesses are extremely tough.For Mobileye to be an outlier on both fronts, its execution needs to be perfect, and its growth flawless. Mobileye earnings for Q4 show a step in the right direction from that standpoint.But with the earnings beat driven largely by aftermarket sales, that step probably isn't big enough for MBLY stock to take another step higher.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postMobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

We apologize for the inconvenience.makeArticleAd();Banking companyCIT Group Inc.(NYSE:CIT), much like other bank stocks in recent days, has woken from a two-month sideways move and looks ripe for a next leg higher. CIT stock is giving traders and active investors a well-defined risk-reward trade setup.Bulls should consider flashing their horns.While the broader stock market continues to relentlessly push higher, I am seeing and hearing more and more bears capitulate and join the buying spree. As a side note, remember that it typically is not until the majority of the bears capitulate and close their losing short positions that a market can begin to ""correct.""In a related manner, it broadly speaking is a low-probability bet to fight a strong market trend such as we have witnessed in the stock market since early November 2016. It's typically easier to trade in the direction of the broader market trend, either buying breakouts, or, after a stock gets overbought, waiting until a first level of support is reached and confirmed by a bullish reversal.Either way, fighting a strongly trending market such as many doubters have over the past few months is an easy way to get frustrated and lose money.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowYes, ultimately any rally comes to an end, but until such time where strong bearish reversals appear and key technical support areas are violated for more than a nanosecond, the higher-probability strategy is to stay with the trend.CIT Stock ChartsTaking this thought and applying it to the multiyear weekly chart of CIT Group, we see that the intermediate-term trend in the stock since early 2016 has been higher.Click to EnlargeWe also see that as a result of this 12-month rally, the stock has now once again reached (and possibly already marginally broken above) a key technical confluence area of resistance.The black diagonal resistance line that stretches from the early 2014 highs currently also lines up with the 200-week simple moving average (red).Note that the 200-week moving average used to act as support in but as of late 2015 has acted as resistance.As such, CIT stock is now at a critical area where if it can push and hold above could lead to a fresh leg higher over time.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock May Be In ""Ludicrous Mode""On the daily chart, we see that CIT stock in early February bounced off its blue and rising 100 day simple moving average, which has acted as an area of support prior.Click to EnlargeLast Friday, the stock staged what technical analysts refer to as an ""outside"" day or a ""bullish engulfing"" day that marginally broke shares past diagonal resistance.

Can Tesla, Inc. Grow Model S Sales in 2017?;2/22/2017;"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) growth in vehicle deliveries continued soaring   higher in 2016, essentially extending the company's streak of   about 50% compound average annualized growth or higher to four   years. But it took Tesla's late-2015 launched Model X SUV for the   company to maintain this impressive growth rate. Model S sales in   2016 were up only a meager 1% last year.With Model S growth quickly decelerating from 59% year over   year growth in 2015, to just 1% growth in 2016, could Model S   sales growth come to a halt -- or even worse -- begin declining   in 2017?Model S. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();Demand is still looking upDespite reporting just 1% growth in Model S sales in 2016,   Tesla seems optimistic about demand for the 2012-launched sedan.   In the company's most recent shareholder letter, Tesla pointed to   rapidly growing demand for the vehicle in the U.S. as evidence of   the vehicle's popularity with consumers.More than four years since its introduction, Model S     continues to expand market share, which is a testament to our     continuous vehicle innovation. In the U.S., which is Tesla's     most mature market, Model S deliveries grew nearly 60% year     over year, increasing its lead status with a 32% share of the     top 12 selling large luxury sedans, as Model S unit growth     significantly outpaced U.S. large luxury sedan category sales     growth.And in the company's brief press release on its fourth-quarter   deliveries, Tesla said fourth-quarter net orders for Model S and   X were at an all-time high.Further, Tesla has some good reasons to be optimistic about   Model S going forward. While Model S was launched in 2012, Tesla   has aggressively been rolling out major updates for the vehicle.   Indeed, some of the most significant updates to Model S have   found their way to the sedan very recently.In August, Tesla launched a flagship P100D Model S with a zero-to-sixty     time of 2.5 seconds when Ludicrous mode is enabled. And the     time dropped to 2.4 seconds earlier this year after a software     update.In October, Tesla began including sensors for autonomous driving in every     vehicle (the autonomous driving itself is slated to come later     on via a software update). Along with this new hardware, Tesla     began offering an enhanced version of its Autopilot.In January, Tesla launched its highest-range Model S yet, capable of     driving 335 miles on a single charge.Of course, Tesla'srelentless updatesto Model S don't guarantee the model's sales will continue to   increase, especially with the vehicle already outselling   comparably priced luxury sedans. But recent new features to Model   S, particularly standard self-driving hardware, are likely to   mitigate the possibility of sales declines in 2017.Could Model 3 orders cannibalize Model S     sales?But all of this overlooks one key concern about demand outlook   for Model S in 2017. Investors may be concerned Tesla's cheaper   Model 3, which is slated to launch later this year, could begin   cannibalizing Model S sales. After all, Model 3's starting price   is nearly half of Model S'.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Fortunately, there's already a precedent for how Model 3   announcements impact demand for Tesla's higher-cost models. Musk   explained how the Model 3's unveiling, which generated about   400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the vehicle in the months   following the product event, impacted Model S demand:An important point worth mentioning, we were fairly worried     about what would happen with the Model 3 announcement. Would it     cause like some a big drop in, say, Model S sales? It seems to     have had the opposite effect. It seems as though S demand has     increased.Therefore, it's possible that as hype grows ahead of the Model   3's launch, more overall interest for Tesla's entire vehicle   lineup could mount. Obviously, investors shouldn't count on this.   But at least Tesla's previous big Model 3 announcement's impact   on Model S demand bodes well for how any upcoming announcements   could affect Model S orders.Investors may be able to find out more about what Tesla   expects from its Model S this year when the company releases its   fourth-quarter earnings today, after market close.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett Might Make These 3 Driverless Car Investing Mistakes;2/22/2017;"Warren Buffett is well-known for having, among the core tenets   of his investment strategy, a preference for companies with   serious ""competitive moats"" -- attributes that give them the   ability to sustainably keep ahead of their competition. But based   on his rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerging industry   like self-driving cars, and his competitive moat ideas don't   necessarily hold water in this world. If you're a fan of the   Oracle of Omaha, beware of following his investment philosophy   into these three mistakes.1. Focusing too much on sizeImage source: Alphabet (Waymo)makeArticleAd();Economies of scale are an important indicator for almost any   company. As the logic goes, the bigger a company is, the greater   its ability to cut per-unit costs.Ford's(NYSE: F) ability to keep its car costs lower thanTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just based on the fact that   it produces more economically designed vehicles. It's also due to   the fact that Ford produced 1.5 million cars in the third quarter   of 2016, compared to the 24,800 cars Tesla Motors delivered   during the same period.But scalability in the driverless car industry doesn't   necessarily have anything to do with car sales. The automaker   with the best technology may ultimately come out ahead.   Technology is scalable at almost no cost. When Tesla Motors   wirelessly uploads its latest software to its already-sold   vehicles around the world, the company pays nearly nothing in   per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at this   stage has much more to do with technology than with numbers of   vehicles sold, and the quantity of cars a company has sold thus   far isn't a indicator for which company is best placed to scale   in the future.2. Exaggerating the value of network effectsWhat network?Network effects are often touted as one of the strongest   competitive moats around.Facebook, an actual social network, perfectly defines the allure of the   network effect. If everyone is using a specific product or   platform, it can be extremely difficult for another company to   make inroads.At first glance, driverless cars seem to be an excellent   opportunity to build network effects. If one company's cars all   ""talk"" to each other as they navigate the roads, they'll get to   their destinations faster and more safely than competitors' --   right? Wrong. Driverless car technology must necessarily take   into account public safety, and unique, exclusionary networks fly   in the face of a universal platform for safe self-driving cars.   Automakers engaged in this space already know this; it's why   Ford, Tesla, and others are equipping their driverless cars with   the best real-world object detection technology available.When Ford announced earlier last week that it would invest $1   billion over five years in Argo AI, it wasn't because   the startup has thousands of self-driving cars on the road   -- it was because the company's robotics expertise ""gives Ford a   distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the   automotive and technology industries,"" explained Ford Chief   Technology Officer Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't relying on   Google's treasure troves of data to guide its vehicles as they   drive around. Instead, Waymo cars are equipped with sensors and   software designed to detect obstacles up to ""two football fields   away in all directions."" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others   aren't interested in network effects in this arena. They're   interested in their cars having the most acute local-area   awareness they can contain.3. Expecting government regulation to limit competitionRegular regulationRegulation can provide some of the widest competitive moats   around. If only one company is able to meet all the regulatory   requirements of being in a business, it's essentially illegal for   others to try to compete with it. The driverless car industry   recognizes this, and is making moves to ensure a level playing   field for all involved.Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars joined together   last April to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, "" a lobbying group whose stated mission is to ""work with   lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and   societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" These companies are   interested in standardizing national policy with simple and   low-cost barriers to entry for all interested automakers. So for   Buffett fans looking to back the company with the strongest   regulation-related advantages, know that some of the biggest   names in the business are working proactively to push   policies that ensure no company can ever build a regulatory   moat.Picking the right self-driving car stockWarren Buffett is an incredible investor, but he doesn't have   answers for every industry. There are many open questions around   self-driving cars, and some companies are morepoised to profitthan others. Rather than sticking to one-size-fits-all investment   mantras,equip yourself with the factsyou need to know, make informed investments, and set your   portfolio to auto-pilot for years to come.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

First Week of April 21st Options Trading For Tesla;2/22/2017;"Investors in Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA) saw new options become available this week, for the April 21st expiration. AtStock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the TSLA options chain for the new April 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $275.00 strike price has a current bid of $16.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $275.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $258.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of TSLA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $277.29/share today.Because the $275.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under thecontract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 37.79% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost.makeArticleAd();Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Tesla Inc, and highlighting in green where the $275.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $280.00 strike price has a current bid of $15.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of TSLA stock at the current price level of $277.29/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $280.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.55% if the stock gets called away at the April 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if TSLA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Tesla Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing TSLA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $280.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under thecontract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.57% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.09% annualized, which we refer to as theYieldBoost.The implied volatility in the put contract example is 41%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $277.29) to be 33%.

Tesla Earnings: 3 Questions for CEO Elon Musk Today;2/22/2017;"After the market closes today,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will update investors on its fourth-quarter   results and will probably provide forecasts for first-quarter and   full-year expectations. Further, the quarterly shareholder letter   may include an update on the company's important lower-cost Model   3, which is slated to launch in the second half of 2017.But some of the most notable takeaways from Tesla's update   tomorrow may not come from the quarterly shareholder letter, but   rather its earnings call following the letter's release. Known   for extra-long question-and-answer sessions, CEO Elon Musk often   fields questions from analysts for about an hour during the live   call. In previous calls, commentary has ranged from insights into   meaty details on the company's gross margin to updates on how   Tesla is anti-selling the Model 3 so demand doesn't get too far   ahead of the company's ability to ramp up supply.Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();So, what are some topics likely to surface during Tesla's   earnings call on Wednesday afternoon? Here are three questions,   along with some relevant background, that analysts are likely to   ask Musk.1. Will Tesla need to raise capital in 2017?In Tesla's third-quarter earnings call (via a Reuterstranscript), Musk said the company's ambitious Model 3 program currently   didn't require any capital raises. But Musk was also careful to   emphasize that this didn't mean the company wouldn't want to   raise capital:Now that's different from saying whether we should raise     capital or not to account for uncertainty to have a larger     buffer and to derisk the business. ... It seems like we     probably won't want to do a capital raise even in Q1. I'm not     saying we won't, but probably not. And it's overall looking     quite promising.Tesla's first quarter is more than halfway over, and the   company hasn't announced any capital raises yet. ButTesla stockis also trading significantly higher than it was during the   company's last earnings call. Tesla stock is up 50% in three   months, making an equity capital raise far more attractive than   it was toward the end of 2016.2. When will Tesla share more details on the Model     3?Tesla's Model 3 will obviously be the center of attention in   Tesla's fourth-quarter update. Investors will want to know if the   vehicle is on schedule and how many units management expects to   deliver in 2017.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.But investors may be particularly antsy to get another update   on how the vehicle's development is faring, given that Tesla'sfirst unveiling of its Model 3was a prototype more than a year before planned production. So   investors may want to know when the company is planning to share   more details on the vehicle. Musk said in November during the   company's shareholder meeting about its SolarCity acquisition   that the next announcements regarding the key vehicle could come   around April.3. When will solar begin positively affecting     results?With Tesla closing its acquisition of SolarCity in November,   investors will want to know whether the company could begin being   a positive cash contributor in 2017. As of Musk's last forecast   for SolarCity's impact on overall financials, he was   optimistic:I think I expect SolarCity to be approximately cash neutral,     all things considered, next year. Yes. It does depend on how     fast we ramp up production in Buffalo.Tesla solar roof. Image source: Tesla Motors.Tesla's fourth-quarter results will be released shortlyafter the market closeson Wednesday, Feb. 22. Its live earnings call will follow, at   2:30 p.m. PST.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock May Be In “Ludicrous Mode”;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been in overdrive. Part of this has been due to the general bullishness across the markets, which seem to hit new highs every day. But the TSLA stock performance has been more than this. Since early December, the shares have gained a sizzling 47%. By comparison, during the same periodFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is up about 13%,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has gained about 22% andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is up 14%.makeArticleAd();Source: Tesla MotorsBut going forward, it's probably reasonable for investors to, well, get more cautious on TSLA stock, which reports earnings Wednesday. Consider that yesterdayUBS Group AG(USA)(NYSE:UBS) analyst Colin Langan published a grim report on the company.One of his big worries is the recent purchase of SolarCity, which has been a persistent money-loser. The company may also face more pressures as the Donald Trump Administration takes steps to pull back support for the clean-energy industry.According toLangan: ""We continue to believe SolarCity is an unneeded distraction during a very challenging launch period."" Actually, his price target on TSLA stock is at $160.Oh, and Wall Street has taken this to heart. On news of the report, Tesla stock fell nearly 4%. In other words, the shares appear to be particularly vulnerable to any negative news.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteYet Langan is certainly not the only Wall Street analyst who is bearish. Just look Cowen's Jeffrey Osborne. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his lowly price target on TSLA stock at $155. Again, he is skeptical about the SolarCity deal.Despite all this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has certainly found ways to gin things up. For example, he has indicated that the company is planning to enter India and theUnited Arab Emirates. No doubt, these markets have large populations of wealthy people that would love to buy Tesla cars. But then again, it will still take time to get traction. Let's face it, there will need to be investments in core infrastructure, like charging stations.Bottom Line On TSLA StockYet lack of demand has never really been the issue with Tesla. Rather, it has been the complexities of production. For example, in early January, TSLA disclosed that it had missed fourth-quarter and full-year estimates on deliveries.What's more, there may be some technical factors that could weigh on the company's shares. Given the high valuation - at over 7 times sales - it is reasonable that the firm will do an equity raise, which would dilute TSLA stock. The fact is that the company has substantial ongoing capital needs.And yes, the rally in the overall equities markets will certainly not last forever. Actually, the next few months could be a real test. That is, what will tax reform look like? And will the looser approach on regulations have much of an immediate impact? For the most part, Wall Street has been factoring in much of the potential good news - and then some.So with the markets getting frothy, it seems likely there will be a correction at some point. In fact, the Federal Reserve may soon become a factor. There may be more urgency to focus on ways to quell the enthusiasm in the markets.Yes, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is a Value TrapIf there is a drop in the markets, the impact could easily be disproportionate for TSLA. This has certainly been the case during the past few years. It's the kind of thing that happens with a fairly risky stock.And finally, Tesla will report its fourth quarter results next Wednesday. Given the surge in the stock already and the various risks like the SolarCity deal, it's probably best to wait on the sidelines for now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

GM Keeps Gaining on Driverless Cars and Possible European Merger;2/21/2017;"Shares of General Motors CompanyGM, the largest American automaker, are up again after the brief President's Day market break. On the back of reports that GM is looking to sell its European operations, along with other positive future-looking moves, the automaker could be poised to keep climbing.GM is up 1.96% to $37.95 per share after early Tuesday afternoon trading. GM is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (BUY) and its shares have been on the rise over the last year.It has been a week since reports surfaced that GM was discussing the sale of its European operations to French-based PSA Group, the maker of popular European car brands Peugeot and Citroën.The deal has already experiencedsome union push back. But German officials have voiced support for the GM and PSA deal asfear of plant closures have been curbed.GM's sale of British-based Vauxhall and German-based Opel to PSA could help its shares rise by 35%, according toa Sunday Barron's report. The deal would make PSA Europe's second-largest automaker by sales, but it could provide GM nearly $1 billion in cash.The European sell-off would also allow the U.S. auto manufacturing giant to pour more of its resources into GM's newest tech-based ventures and markets.InnovationGM has invested heavily in new technologies including ride-sharing and electric cars in the last few years. The automaker paid $500 million to purchase a minority stake in the second-largest U.S. ride-sharing company Lyft. It also purchased the autonomous car technology company Cruise Automation for $1 billion in March 2016.U.S. electric vehiclesales rose 37% in 2016.

The service allows users to rent GM vehicles on-demand for short amounts of time. But unlike rival Zipcar, there is no membership fee. The service boasts that its 24,000 members have traveled nearly 78 million miles.Users can rent Chevy, Cadillac and Buick vehicles on their smart phonesfor an hourly rate of $6 to $8.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Will Hit $300 After Q4 Earnings;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElectric vehicle companyTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. With TSLA stock driving to all-time highs, investors are looking for confirmation that Tesla - as a company - is heading in the right direction.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor the record, analysts expect the Palo Alto, California-based company to lose 43 cents per share, narrower than the loss of 87 cents last year.Tesla, which has alternated between beating and missing estimates, posted a surprise profit for the third quarter. Revenue is expected to be $2.19 billion compared to revenue of $1.75 billion a year ago.My GPS has alreadyforecast a higher pricefor TSLA stock following the result, but the Tesla earnings numbers - to be reported Wednesday after the bell - won't be the reason.The Real Driver for Tesla StockTSLA stock has gone on a strong run, surging more than 60% in 12 months, mostly in anticipation of positive results for the quarter.Beyond the top- and bottom-line numbers, however, Tesla stock will move based on the details the company provides about its new Model 3 - the company's all-electric mass-market vehicle that CEO Elon Musk hopes to start producing in July and selling next year. Competing withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral MotorsCompany(NYSE:GM) has been a major goal for Musk.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverWhat's more, Musk hasn't lowered expectations. The company still plans to ramp up vehicle production to a rate of 500,000 vehicles in 2018, which Tesla stock analysts consider highly ambitious.And much of the production goals depend on the success of the $35,000 Model 3, where investors' focus has shifted to over the last three months since the company reported disappointing vehicle deliveries.Tesla knocked out the shorts earlier this month as the company announced that its California plant would be prepped this month to start building Model 3s, and that full-scale production should begin by July. That lined up with Tesla's previously announced timeline - and a lack of delayssent TSLA shareholders into a frenzy.Bottom Line on TSLA StockBeyond the Model 3 and vehicle production targets, TSLA's need for cash will be another major factor on the conference call with analysts.Although Musk stopped short of promising to raise cash in the third-quarter conference call, Musk didn't shoot down the idea either, saying he would consider it if market conditions were right.Likewise, analysts will pay attention to estimates of how much cash the company expects to burn through in the quarters ahead.""Everything seems to be going according to plan regarding the car, but analysts will want to hear more details about ramp-up expenses,"" saidBill Selesky, an analyst with Argus Research.Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for FreeNot to mention, there's the issue with absorbing the SolarCity business, which generated substantial losses before TSLA brought it into the fold. Worries about how much SolarCity would weigh down then-Tesla Motors caused shares to drop more than 20% between the Aug. 1 buyout agreement and the early December lows.Still, to the extent Tesla can lower production-cost estimates for the Model 3, while maintaining its production targets, TSLA stock should reach $300 in the next three months. That'd be another 8% on top of its already all-time high price.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks OffThe postTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Will Hit $300 After Q4 Earningsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Free;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is on a monster run of late. The long trade on AMD stock has been absurdly easy, especially when using options. I've even had success shorting the company recently, but only because I booked my profits quickly.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrLast year conditioned me to not overstay my welcome in winning trades.After extended rallies, I am usually tempted to initiate short trades rather than long ones. Today, I will go against my instinct, though, and go long in AMD stock to capture a potential move (unthinkably) higher.Advanced Micro Devices' fundamentals haven't really changed in recent months. We're in a digital world and becoming even more reliant on tech. AMD is one of few who are the major suppliers to the brains of this tech world. This tells me that there is room for all - like rivalsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) to prosper. So I don't want to short anything just for the sake of shorting.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowClick to EnlargeFurthermore, I see things I like in AMD's stock chart. The price action has been constructive. I see higher lows challenging necklines that if broken upwards can invite even more buyers.I'm not usually one to chase a stock long on a 6%-plus day like what AMD stock is putting out on Tuesday. But the options market makes this fairly easy while leaving room for error.How to Trade AMD Stock NowThe bet:Sell AMD Oct $9 put for 60 cents per contract. By selling this put, I am committing to owning AMD shares at the strike sold. So I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at that price. I can even buy sacrifice Apr $9 puts for 4 cents to cover the crash scenario should it come.Usually I like to sell opposite risk to balance my trade, but in this case, I will refrain. In fact, I'll add an extra twist that could provide even more profit potential.Go Long the Super Spike in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe Juice (optional): Buy the AMD Mar $14.5/$15.5 debit call spread for 28 cents to open.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is the Perfect VALUE Play;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI love growth stocks as much as the next guy, butAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) might just be my favorite at the moment. That's because GOOGL stock has something that a lot of other high-growth dynamos simply don't have:makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockAny value left whatsoever.I'm prudent when it comes to hyper-growth stocks such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). I've missed out on some great runs as a result, but I also haven't gotten burned when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focus on ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP - and I believe GOOGL stock falls into this category.Go With GARPWith growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earnings ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x its earnings growth rate, if earnings are growing at 15% annually or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock has a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I'll allow up to 1.5 depending on the earnings growth rate.GOOGL stock trades at 29x FY16 earnings and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analysts see five-year annualized growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seems to qualify as a GARP pick.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBut there's even more good news.This doesn't consider the net cash position of GOOGL stock. See, I value a company net of its net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch used to do. With $86.4 billion on its balance sheet, that pulls the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.On $19.5 billion in net income for FY16, we suddenly find that Alphabet stock trades at 24.6 times FY16 earnings and only about 17.5 times FY17 earnings.That's the first step for me in even determining if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involved in.How Is Alphabet's Business?The next thing I examine is how healthy Alphabet Inc's actual businesses are.I still don't like the idea that GOOGL is basically a giant digital advertising billboard with a venture capital arm. However, I can't deny that Google's search engineholds an astonishing 80.47% market share. As long as four out of every five searches are conducted on Google, advertisers will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monumental proportions, or some incredibly innovative new method of searching, to change this significantly.Alphabet's 17% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $22.4 billion comes as no surprise.So next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantastic Aggregate paid clicks up 36%, paid clicks on Google properties up 43%, and paid clicks on Network properties up 7%. A lot of people freaked out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the above categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realize that this is because more advertising is being pushed to mobile.As for Other Bets, which is basically the company's VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollars in the quarter. But considering free cash flow was $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL has that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it takes is one of these VC bets to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.This brief glance tells me that Alphabet is an advertising business with dominant market share that is literally printing money. I mean, it generated $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That'sfreecash flow, meaning it can do whatever it wants with it.Go Long the Super Spike In Tesla Inc (TSLA) EarningsThat's even after spending about $10 billion in capex.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockNormally, I would continue to examine other parts of the business if I were looking to include GOOGLin something like my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio.But for right now, I see enough to suggest investors continue their own due diligence and strongly consider GOOGL stock as a GARP play.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Tesla, Inc. Earnings: What to Expect From Gross Margin;2/21/2017;"WhileTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) plans for its upcoming Model 3 will likely be   the main focus when the electric-car maker reports itsfourth-quarter resultson Wednesday, another area worth checking on will be Tesla's   gross profit margin, or its revenue less cost of goods sold as a   proportion of total revenue. As Tesla continues to grow its   business at a rapid rate, it's important for Tesla to sustain a   sufficient gross profit margin to help support its ambitious   growth plans, particularly as the company readies its lower-cost,   higher-volume Model 3 for a launch later this year.Ahead of Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings release, here's what   we know about Tesla's gross margin metrics for various aspects of   its business.Model X in Tesla's car factory. Image source: authormakeArticleAd();What has happened with Tesla's gross profit margins?In recent quarters, Tesla's gross profit margin has been   moving steadily upward. But it hasn't yet returned to pre-Model X   levels.TSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYChartsTesla's late-2015 launch of its Model X has weighed on the   company's profitability thanks to a slower-than-expected   production ramp-up and what management has admitted to be ""hubris   in adding far too much technology to the Model X in version   1....""But Tesla's recent significant progress in its profit margins   offers promising signs for the company's ability to benefit from   operational leverage as Model X deliveries increase, rising from   2,400 in its first quarter of 2016 to 9,500 in the fourth   quarter.In Tesla's third quarter, total automotive gross margin and   gross profit per car increased substantially. Non-GAAP automotive   gross margin when excluding benefits from zero emission vehicle   credits and the impact of stock-based compensation, was 25%, up   140 basis points sequentially. GAAP automotive gross margin was   29.4%, up from 23.1% in Q2. Tesla said the improvements were   driven by improving manufacturing efficiency and higher   production volume.Overall gross margin was 27.7% in Tesla's third quarter,   compared to 21.6% in Q2. It was helped by higher zero emission   vehicle credits, the company's improving gross margin in its   automotive business, and its sequential improvement in its   services and other segment (from 2.5% in Q2 to 3.4% in Q3).What to look for in Q4For Tesla's fourth quarter, management has said it expects its   automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits, to be between   about 25.1% and 26.1%, or between 23.9% and 24.9% on a non-GAAP   basis. Notably, however, since Tesla has already said its   fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries were about 3,000 units below   its expectations, it's likely Tesla's reported automotive gross   profit margin will be near the low end of this guidance range --   or possibly even slightly below it.Image source: Author.For Tesla's services and other segment, investors should look   for a sequential improvement from its 3.4% margin achieved in Q3.   Since energy storage products are accounted for in this segment,   an expected rise in energy storage deliveries should benefit the   segment's gross margin.Of course, guidance for its gross margin in Q1 and throughout   2017 will likely be just as helpful for investors in gaining more   insight into the company's profitability trajectory ahead of   Model 3. So, investors should look for an update on what Tesla   expects from its gross profit margin in its first quarter and   beyond.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Battery Stocks to Buy in 2017;2/21/2017;"Overheating batteries spelled disaster forSamsunglast year, but batterystocks?They're red hot in a good way-- and ripe for the picking as we enter into 2017.From miners of lithium to manufacturers of lithium ion,   nickel-metal hydride, and other sorts of batteries, investors   today have a good handful of public battery companies to choose   from. For my money, though, the best ""battery stocks"" to watch   are the ones targeting the market for electric cars:Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Panasonic(NASDAQOTH: PCRFY) , andGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) .(And no, that's not a typo. As I'll explain, General Motors   reallyisa force to be reckoned with in electric car batteries.)makeArticleAd();Batteries are evolving -- and more important than ever.     Image source: Getty Images.TeslaWhy cars? Partly because of scale. Tesla's 60 kWh battery   pack, for example, is powered by 14 battery modules, containing   384 battery cells each. That's a total of at least 5,376 cells   that go into each Tesla Model S sold. Larger battery packs will   logically contain even more modules and cells. Multiply that by   the 500,000 electric cars Tesla plans to be selling annually by   2020, that's ... a lot of batteries. And that's before   counting the numbers of batteries (admittedly, of different   types) that go into powering electric cars from General Motors,   fromFord, fromToyota,Nissan, and all the others.In addition, you've probably heard by now thatTesla has changed its name, dropping the ""Motors"" moniker from ""Tesla Motors."" Part of the   reason for this change is that Tesla is making energy storage for   homes and business a bigger part ofitsbusiness, with its new Powerwall product. In doing so, Tesla   isn't just opening a new market for batteries, and creating a   place for solar power, generated by its solar-panels business, to   be stored when not needed -- it's also giving itself room to   scale up its business, so that it will be able to make full use   of the battery Gigafactory it's building in the Nevada   desert.PanasonicIncidentally, this offers us a nice segue into discussing   Tesla's partner in the Gigafactory project -- our second battery   stock to watch, which is Panasonic.The Japanese electronics giant is assisting Tesla with battery   production in Nevada, and hopes to benefit from both the scale of   battery production there, and from the assured customer for its   batteries that Tesla will become (and indeed, already is).   Already the world's top battery manufacturer by a factor of   3, Panasonic's battery dominance promises to grow even   further through its partnership with Tesla.I'd also be remiss in not pointing out that, whereas Tesla may   be the biggest story stock in battery investing, it's not   currently profitable -- but its supplier Panasonic is. According   to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, Panasonic earned $1.9 billion in profit over the past year. And   Panasonic's ""automotive and industrial systems"" division, which   houses its battery business, contributed more profit ($914   million) than any of the company's other three big divisions.   With a stock now trading for less than 14 times trailing   earnings, Panasonic is arguably one of the best bargains in   battery stocks today.General MotorsBut it's still not as cheap as General Motors. I know, I know   -- you say General Motors makes cars, not batteries. But take a   look at whatkindof cars General Motors has been making lately: The Chevy Volt,   namedMotor Trend's Car of the Year in 2011.  The Chevy Bolt, named Car of   the Yearthisyear. In both instances, General Motors won accolades for   rolling out electric cars.While General Motors doesn't make the batterycellsthat go into powering these cars (South Korea's LG Chem does that   for the company), GM does assemble those cells into the batterypacks. What's more, GM's involvement in battery technology may be   deeper than you know.InThe Powerhouse: Inside the Invention of a Battery to Save the   World, formerWall Street Journalcorrespondent Steve Levine describes the history of America's   Argonne National Laboratory and its efforts to build a better   rechargeable battery -- specifically, one capable of powering a   car for 200 miles of driving on a single charge. Central to the   book's story is General Motors' work with battery behemoths such   as LG Chem, and also with ground-breaking start-ups such as   privately held Envia -- including through making equity   investments in the latter.Simply put, GM is working -- both through its in-house battery   lab and through partnerships elsewhere in the battery industry --   to develop an entirely new ""superbattery"" that it calls NMC 2.0.   Unlike the banks of generic, cheap, but older-tech   nickel-cobalt-aluminum 18650s that power Tesla's sedans, GM has   been developing a nickel-manganese-cobalt cell that it believes   will offer greater energy density, giving Chevy's Bolts (and   future electric cars) a range advantage over Tesla.At last report, General Motors still hadn't solved the mystery   of inventing NMC 2.0. But investing in GM stock for just 6.2   times earnings, you wouldn't be paying much for the potential   that it eventually will.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Go Long the Super Spike In Tesla Inc (TSLA) Earnings;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI recently wrote up severalTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) trades where profits came too fast. This is a good problem to have. So why am I booking profits instead of riding Tesla stock higher? Simple: I don't trust the fundamentals.makeArticleAd();Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)Before you send in the hate mail, I am not dissing Tesla or its prospects. I am merely acknowledging the hurdles it has to grow into its valuation. Having said that, I reiterate that I am a fan of the price action in Tesla stock.Usually I like to sell risk against extreme opinions. So logic here would be to want to sell calls or call spreads against this mega spike. Not this time. Earnings are coming and these are binary events. For the short term, trading earnings is more gambling than investing. I don't know how traders will react to earnings regardless of the quality of the numbers themselves.So today, I want to invest some of my profits in going long TSLA stock for a breakout to new highs. I want to ride the so-called ""animal spirit"" that is the meme of 2017.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverClick to EnlargeTechnically, TSLA stock already hit my target from the $258 per share breakout as noted on the chart. From here, we would need a game changing event and earnings could serve that purpose. Wall Street has a crush on Elon Musk and his conference call could be a treasure trove of catalysts.The Bet:Buy the TSLA March $330 call. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.60 per contract to open. This is my maximum potential risk. If TSLA spikes to new highs this level should be within target.I could modify this trade for a more moderate bet by turning it into a spread. So I'd buy TSLA March 31 $315/$320 debit call spread for 60 cents per contract. If TSLA rallies past my spread I stand to gain more than $4 per contract. The spread makes the trade more reasonable as it is closer to current price. So I don't require as big a move as buying calls at $330.Often I like to lower my out of pocket expense and in this case I could sell some puts against TSLA stock levels I deem safe.The Bank (optional):Sell the TSLA Jan 2018 $200 put. For this I collect $14 per share. I need TSLA stock to stay above my strike sold or risk being put the stock. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own Tesla stock at $200 per share. Anything below $186 per share would constitute losses on this leg alone.I am not required to hold my Tesla options trade open through their expiration. I can close any of these trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

How a Major Utility Fell on Its Face in Renewable Energy;2/21/2017;"It was supposed to be an easy transition forNRG Energy(NYSE: NRG) from utility giant to renewable energy powerhouse.   The company had billions in cash flow coming in from fossil fuel   plants that could then be turned around and invested in wind,   solar, electric charging stations, and energy storage. Simple   enough, right?The problem for NRG Energy and former CEO David Crane is that   utility investors and renewable energy investors are like oil and   water. They simply don't mix and neither one quite understands   the other. So, less than two years after launching a brand-new   Home Solar business and putting a huge focus on clean energy, the   company is shutting down parts of its solar business and looking   into strategic alternatives afterElliott ManagementandBluescape Energy Partnerswere given seats on the board of directors. Don't be fooled: NRG   Energy is heading for a breakup because dirty and clean energy   just can't live together.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The death of NRG HomeAt one time, NRG Home was supposed to give SolarCity a ""run   for their money."" Seriously, NRG thought it could build a solar   installation arm that rivaled the biggest players in the country.   It acquired Roof Diagnostics to gain a decent market share and   added solar products company Goal Zero as another way to attract   customers.The theory was good on the surface. A big utility name puts   its financial muscle behind residential solar, which will give   the product validation and the company's operations stability.   Only that's not what the industry needed.Instead of customers flocking to a utility trying to distrupt   itself, they stuck with companies trying to disrupt the world.   SolarCity,Vivint Solar,Sunrun, andSunPowerremained more attractive options for customers than NRG Home. And   in the past 18 months, the market has been shifting away from   large national installers to local and regional installers that   have lower costs and can be more nimble in the market.We've seen something similar with NRG's EV charging network.   It's a good solution from the wrong player in the market. So,   instead of NRG's flexible charging network being a marvel of the   EV community,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is the charging network that's become the standard   everyone else has to live up to.The clash of the old world and the newIt isn't that NRG's management got their vision of the future   wrong. It's that NRG wasn't necessarily the company to execute on   that vision. Its customers were confused by the transition to   solar, and in many states NRG Home was trying to enter, they had   no prior knowledge of NRG. And investors in a utility like NRG   were looking for cash flow, not billions of dollars of investment   in a business that may take years to show real signs of   progress.With the activist investors involved, NRG Energy is likely to   split into a green business and a fossil fuel business. The green   business has already been separated and is either shutting down   or being sold. NRG Home is being wound down and a majority stake   in EVgo has been sold. It's possible theNRG Yield(NYSE: NYLD) stake will be sold as well in an effort to monetize   assets and return the cash to shareholders.Whether there's a spinoff or just a sale of assets, it looks   like the old energy world is beating the new at NRG Energy.A transition gone wrongIt's harder than it seems for fossil fuel companies orutilities to make a transitionto new, cleaner forms of energy. The investment structure and   incentives for the two are just too different to coexist. Fossil   fuels and utilities are all about cash flows and finding ways to   make money off the status quo.Renewable energy, particularly energy production on rooftops,   is about breaking the energy status quo and replacing it with   more individual independence. And breaking the traditional energy   business doesn't always come with predictable cash flows or   installations each quarter.The two strategies are simply at odds with each other, and NRG   Energy abandoning most of its renewable business is a casualty of   the realities of the energy industry today. Old and new forms of   energy just don't mix under one roof and NRG Energy found that   out the hard way.10 stocks we like better than NRG EnergyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Tesla, Volatility Index and Gilead;2/21/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 21, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),Volatility Index(NYSEARCA:VXX-Free Report)andGilead(NASDAQ:GILD-Free Report).5 Major Myths About Options TradingWhen it comes to investing, pretty much everyone has an opinion. While those opinions are great, sometimes investors will spread myths about subjects they don't have a firm understanding of. One of the most confusing subjects isoptions trading. Due to the many moving parts involved, investors find themselves befuddled and not knowing where to start. Here I'm going to debunk five major myths of options trading.Myth #1: Options are Riskier than StocksThis is one of those broad-based, blanket statements that does not tell the whole truth. People think options are riskier because you can lose 100% of your investment in an option. However, you can use options to limit your risk on trades.Here's an example, let's say you wanted to buy 100 shares ofTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report)ahead of their earnings report next week because you think they are going to have a good report and the stock will go up. Today it would cost you around $270 per share or $27,000 to own 100 shares. If TSLA goes down 10% on its earnings report, you are going to lose $2,700 dollars. If it goes up 10%, you'll make $2,700.On the flipside, you could buy the March 17th$270 Call option for $1,350. If TSLA goes down 10% and stays there through expiration, you'll lose your $1,350. If it goes up 10%, you're call option will be worth at least $2,700, maybe more. If you wanted to define your risk as $2,700, you could buy two of these contracts, controlling 200 shares of Tesla rather than only 100. Same amount of nominal risk, but now your upside potential is doubled.Myth #2: You Need to be a Sophisticated Trader for   OptionsThere certainly are options strategies that involve a great deal of complexity. With so many choices available to trade it can be very complicated. Each options expiration date has call options and put options of varying strikes available. At first glance the selection process can be daunting. Many stocks now have weekly options expiration, making these even more overwhelming for investors.You don't need a PhD in Applied Mathematics to use simple options strategies to make money and create income. For example, buying a call in the hopes that a stock goes up. If you know there is an event coming up that you think the stock will profit from, you can buy a call near the money on the stock and if it goes up you can profit. If you want to make a trade that benefits when the stock goes down, you can buy a put option in the hopes the stock goes down. Start with the basics and add more complex strategies as you become more comfortable.Myth #3: It Takes a Lot of Money to Trade   OptionsThis couldn't be further from the truth. It's a lot less capital intensive to trade options than it is to buy 100 shares of your favorite stock. Most brokerage firms allow you to sell options premium, a more advanced strategy, in accounts that contain as little as $2,000. Compare that to Pattern Day Trader accounts which require at least $25,000.Trading options allows smaller accounts to gain exposure to more stocks for less money. You can diversify your options trades across many industries and many stocks simultaneously. There are even options on ETFs like theVolatility Index(NYSEARCA:VXX-Free Report)so you can gain exposure to exotic financial instruments while managing your risk.Myth #4: Time is Always Working Against YouIf you are long or buy options then yes, there is a time value element that's working against you. However, there are simple ways to flip the script so this time works in your favor. One way is by using long call and long put spreads rather than buying a call or put outright. The other is to use credit spreads.A long call spread, or a bull call spread, is a two-legged options trade where a closer to the money option is purchased to open and a further out of the money call option is sold to open or shorted. This helps to drop the overall net debit or price of the call spread. It also limits the total profit potential of the trade.For example, if I bought a March 17th$67.50 Call onGilead(NASDAQ:GILD-Free Report)today it would cost me about $2.95. My upside potential would be unlimited but my breakeven would be the strike price plus the net debit which in this case is $2.95, making my breakeven $70.45.However, if I believe Gilead's upside is limited to $72.50, I could sell that $72.50 Call at the same expiration and take back some money, dropping my overall cost on the spread, therefore bringing down my breakeven. I could sell the $72.50 Call for 55c. Now my cost on the $67.50/72.50 Call spread is only $2.40, my breakeven now $69.90, and I'll make more money up to $72.50 than I would have with the long call by itself.Another example is the credit spread. Rather than buying the aforementioned spread, if I'm bearish on GILD I can sell the spread. So instead of spending $2.40 for the spread I would pocket $2.40. My risk would be the $5 difference in the strike prices, minus the $2.40 I took in premium. So I risk $2.60 to make $2.40. This credit spread would max out or give me the largest possible winning outcome of $2.40 if shares of GILD closed at or below $62.50 at expiration on March 17th.Myth #5: You Need a Special Account to Trade   OptionsWell, sort of. While you do need to sign an options risk acknowledgement form and get your account approved specifically for options trading, it's not exactly a ""special account."" Pretty much any non-qualified, or non-retirement, account is eligible for options trading. I specify non-qualified because accounts like IRAs are restricted as to the type of options trading you can do since you can't short stocks in retirement accounts.There are several levels of options approvals out there, designed to save investors from themselves. Each level or tier is restricted, only allowing certain types of trading. Each broker has their own guidelines for what these levels look like. All you really need for approval is experience trading and capital. It's not like you have to be a millionaire or anything.Bottom LineThose are the five biggest myths about options trading that scare off potential traders. If you take the time to learn more about trading options, you'll find that they are a great way to manage your risk and gain exposure to the stock market.FollowBrian Bolanon Twitter@BBolan1Want more articles from this author?

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointing to an extension of Wall Street's record run, as traders come back refreshed from the President's Day break.Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) is up on strong earnings results, whileWal-Mart Stores Inc's(NYSE:WMT) earnings are waiting in the wings. Meanwhile, the Markit February preliminary purchasing managers' manufacturing and services indexes are on tap later this morning.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.29%, withS&P 500futures adding 0.18% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.17%.On the options front, volume remained brisk on Friday with about 18.6 million calls and 16.1 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arrived at 0.59, while the 10-day moving average dropped to a two-month low of 0.63.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) hit fresh all-time-high territory on Friday, following a new data on Apple Pay's acceptance at U.S. retailers. Elsewhere,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is seeing renewed call activity ahead of this Wednesday's quarterly earnings report andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) tagged a new all-time high on Friday, joining the rest of the so-called ""FANG"" stocks in record territory.Apple Inc. (AAPL)Forget about iPhones and iPads, the new driver for AAPL stock is services. On Friday, a report emerged that one of those services,Apple Pay, is now accepted by 36% of U.S. retailers, with another 22% expected to start accepting the service in the next 12 months. The narrative on Apple Pay has only grown more bullish since CEO Tim Cook's statement that Apple Pay transactions were up 500% year-over-year in the most recent fiscal quarter.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeAAPL options traders jumped on the report, sending more than 920,000 contracts across the tape on the shares. Furthermore, calls accounted for an above average 67% of the day's take. AAPL may be trading near all-time highs, but that hasn't stopped options traders from setting their sights even higher, with more than 36,000 call contracts open at the March $140 strike and another 8,500 at the $145 strike.With AAPL breaking through peak March call OI at $135 on Friday, look for options traders to adjust their targets even higher, resulting in another round of heavy call activity this week.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Electric car guru Tesla is slated to take the earnings stage this Wednesday amid mixed sentiment. Wall Street is expecting a loss of 30 cents per share on revenue of $2.2 billion, though thewhisper numberis pricing in a wider loss of 41 cents per share.Per-share results may be moot, however, as traders will be looking for information on deliveries and Model 3 production, which is slated to begin this week.Tesla has more than 370,000 Model 3 preordersfor the Model 3 and CEO Elon Musk has promised production of 500,000 cars per year by 2018, but Tesla only delivered 76,000 vehicles in all of 2016.Options traders are naturally skeptical of TSLA stock, especially with the shares pulling back from their recent all-time highs. On Friday, TSLA options activity underscored that trepidation, with calls only eking out 51% of the more than 473,000 contracts traded. Currently, peak 24 Feb call OI totals 4,800 contracts at the $305 strike, while peak 24 Feb put OI numbers 1,900 at $260. Implieds are pricing in a roughly 7% move for TSLA stock following earnings.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)AMZN stock was the last of the so-called ""FANG"" stocks to reach all-time-high territory on Friday, though the shares are still stymied by overhead resistance at $850. However,Amazon may be ready for a breakout, and options traders appear to be preparing for additional upside.Friday's call activity came in slightly above average for AMZN, with these typically bullish bets accounting for 53% of the 302,000 contracts traded. Furthermore, the March put/call open interest ratio has steadily declined for the past couple of weeks.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Itching to Break All-Time HighsWhile the ratio currently rests at a bearish leaning 1.22, it has dropped from a perch north of 1.30 as calls are added at a faster rate than puts - a trend that could signify options traders' expectations of additional gains for AMZN stock.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends5 Top Dividend Stocks to Shower Solid ReturnsThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Tesla (TSLA) to Post Q4 Earnings: Will the Stock Disappoint?;2/20/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAis set to report fourth-quarter 2016 resultsafter the market closeson Feb 22. In the last quarter, this electric car maker posted a positive earnings surprise of 112.28%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Tesla Motors, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTesla Motors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Tesla Motors, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing this QuarterTesla delivered 22,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter, missing the 25,000 unit target. The total deliveries in 2016 were 76,230 vehicles, falling short of the projection of 79,000 units. This could affect revenues in the quarter. Tesla claimed the company was unable to meet targets due to short-term production challenges.Tesla's costs for research & development and selling, general and administrative expenses is also a concern. The company is investing heavily in increasing production capacity, the development of Model X and Model 3, the Gigafactory construction and expansion of sales, services and Supercharger infrastructure. For 2016, the company expects operating expenses to rise by 30% due to engineering, design, and testing expenses related to Model 3 supplier contracts as well as higher sales and service costs associated with expanding geographically. Moreover, due to accelerated production plans, Tesla now expects capital expenditure for 2016 to be around $1.18 billion.The company has been outperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry for the past six months, with the company gaining 22.1% while the industry rallied only 14.3% over the same period. However, this gain can be particularly attributable to Tesla's recent expansion decisions, including the venture into the Middle East.The company reported losses for full year 2015 and 2014 as well as in first-half 2016. Further, the company reported profits in third-quarter 2016 but it remains to be seen whether this can be sustained in the quarter to be reported. Moreover, the company also faces the risk of potential buyers being deterred due to the low number of charging stations. Although the company is working toward developing a supercharging network, the number of charging stations still remains drastically low, particularly when compared with gasoline stations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Tesla is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP:Tesla has an Earnings ESP of -55.46%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of $1.85 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Spartan Motors, Inc.SPARhas an Earnings ESP of +50% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week;2/19/2017;"Stocks extended their rally last week as both theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) andS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  gained over a full percentage point. The   two indexes are up nearly 5% so far for the year.^DJIdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Earnings season is likely to continue to produce big stock   swings for the companies involved. And the next five trading days   have no shortage of big names posting their results, includingWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) ,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,andGap(NYSE: GPS) .Wal-Mart's customer trafficThe world's biggest retailer announces earnings results before   the market opens on Tuesday. Expectations are low, with consensus   estimates pegging sales growth of just 1% as earnings fall 13%,   to $1.29 per share.Customer traffic figures will be key to watch this week.   Wal-Mart has managed seven straight quarters of improvements   there, but last quarter, the figure slipped to nearly flat. Since   then, rivalTargetrevealed a surprising 1.7% traffic decline over the holiday   season, which suggests growth was hard to come by as competition   heated up last quarter.Image source: Wal-Mart.Any growth slowdown might be complicated by rising costs,   especially in the U.S. business. On the positive side, Wal-Mart   is likely to keep showering shareholders with dividends and stock   buyback spending that's being funded by surging free cash   flow.Tesla's deliveries forecastTesla shares are up over 50% in the last three months heading   into Wednesday's earnings release despite the fact that investors   know the electric-car manufacturerwon't hit management's delivery forecast. CEO Elon Musk and his team signed over roughly 22,000 vehicles   to customers, representing 27% growth year over year compared to   the 25,000 that executives were targeting. Management blamed what   they called short-term production challenges around the   transition to new autopilot hardware that delayed shipping.Image source: Tesla.Investors will be looking for evidence this week that those   production challenges are in the past. At the same time, there's   less hope Tesla will announce bottom-line profitability this   quarter, but gross margin and gross profit per car should   continue marching higher.Looking forward, shareholders are eager to learn Musk's   thinking on the company's sales targets for the coming year as   the mass-market Model 3 comes online. Telsa is hoping to use that   car to help bring its annual production up to 500,000 units from   about 100,000 automobiles today, and its 2017 forecast will   communicate a lot about whether that aggressive goal is   realistic.Gap's profit marginGap recently revealed encouraging operating details about the   fourth-quarter report it will publish on Thursday.   Comparable-store sales rose 1% to reverse an 8% dive in the   prior-year period. That improvement includes a 5% uptick for the   Old Navy brand, flat results for Gap, and a 3% drop for Banana   Republic. ""Against a challenging retailer backdrop,"" CEO Art Peck   said in early February, ""we're pleased to report growth in our   top-line and comp sales during the critical holiday quarter.""This week's announcement will provide important context on   those revenue gains, including whether Gap was forced to ramp up   its promotions to protect market share from rivals. That's why   investors will be focused on the retailer's merchandise margins   and any comments management might have on customer traffic   trends.Peck and his team will likely discuss Gap's plan to return to   growth across the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy franchises   through improved product offerings like the recent Athleta   launch. That job will be made harder by a weak retailing   environment, though, and so investors might want to brace for a   conservative 2017 forecast from management this week.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Are General Motors and Lyft About to Crush All Self-Driving Rivals?;2/19/2017;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) is planning to build and deploy thousands of   self-driving electric cars in test fleets with Lyft next year,   according to a newReutersreport.If that's for real, it will be by far the largest fleet of   autonomous test vehicles in operation. It's a very big deal that   has huge implications for GM, Lyft, and their   rivals.What the report saidAccording to the Reuters article, GM will build thousands of   Chevy Bolts equipped with prototype versions of the self-driving   system GM has developed with its subsidiary, Cruise Automation.   Most of these self-driving Bolts will go into ride-hailing   service with Lyft in several states starting sometime in   2018.makeArticleAd();GM has no plans right now to sell the self-driving Bolts to   the general public.CEO Mary Barra announced in December that GM would begin     producing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt test vehicles in early     2017. Image source: General Motors.What it would mean for GMGM has been working on self-driving technology for years. That   work seemed to take a big leap forward with the acquisition of   San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation early last year.   It appears that Cruise has since become the center of GM's   research efforts. Cruise's self-driving Chevy Bolt test cars have   become regular sights on San Francisco streets, and recent videos   taken from inside self-driving Bolt test cars suggest thatthe GM/Cruise technology is at a fairly advanced   level. GM announced in December that it would soon begin   producing self-driving Bolt test vehicles, but the hint was that   -- at least in the near term -- they'd be produced in   small quantities for GM's own testing.A mass deployment would demonstrate two things: First, that   GM's technology really is at a high level, and second, that GM   and its supplier partners are ready and able to mass-produce   self-driving cars.Both of those things are significant. Taken together, it would   be a strong argument that GM is leading the way to mass-produced   Level 4 self-driving vehicles. Companies likeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of investor attention for   (among other things) their self-driving efforts, but --   as of right now, at least -- GM seems poised to leapfrog just   about everybody.What it would mean for LyftLyft, like its larger rival Uber Technologies, knows that   replacing its human drivers with self-driving vehicles is crucial   to its future. Autonomous ride-hailing vehicles will allow Lyft   to lower its prices while generating (hopefully) strong   profits.Uber has been working on its own self-driving technology for a   couple of years, and has a fewprototype self-driving test cars in servicenow. Lyft isn't known to have done any work on a self-driving   system of its own, but it doesn't need to: GMowns a 9% stakein Lyft, and GM seems to have it handled.If Lyft beats Uber to a self-driving fleet at scale, Uber will   have a big challenge on its hands.GM president Dan Ammann (center) with Lyft co-founders Logan     Green (left) and John Zimmer. GM owns 9% of the ride-hailing     company, and Ammann is a member of its board of directors.     Image source: General Motors.Could this be for real?The Reuters report, by veteran auto-business journalist Paul   Lienert, cites two unnamed ""sources familiar with the automaker's   plans."" Generally, investors (and everyone else) should take   reports based on information from unnamed sources with a grain or   two of salt. But a few things suggest to me that this is probably   for real.First, Lienert is a veteran with good sources, and Reuters   holds its reporting to high standards. Second, the report fits   with the known facts: GM and Lyft have both said that atest of autonomous GM vehicles in Lyft service is   forthcoming. Third, GM's Orion, Michigan, factory, where the Bolt is built,   has plenty of capacity to do a special production run in the   thousands.Finally, and most tellingly, neither Lyft nor GM denied the   report. In fact, GM's statement in response was almost a smiling   hint:We do not provide specific details on potential future     products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV     technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network     applicationsooner than you might think. [Emphasis added.]Translation: This is likely to happen, and it might begin   sooner than 2018.How important is this for GM investors?If it happens, it will be a big deal. While the idea of a   ""race"" to self-driving technologyisn't really useful to investors, a big test like this next year (or sooner) will show that GM   isn't about to be disrupted by Silicon Valley when it comes to   self-driving. It will also give lots of people an   opportunity to experience self-driving technology firsthand,   which will almost certainly speed its adoption by increasing   consumer demand.If nothing else, it seems very likely to attract investors'   attention and give GM shares a boost.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Solar Energy Production Hit a Record High in 2016, So What's Wrong With Solar Stocks?;2/18/2017;"2016 was an amazing year for the solar industry overall, even   if it wasn't great for solar stocks. GTM Research recently   reported that its upcoming U.S. Solar Market Insight Report done   with the Solar Energy Industries Association will reveal a 95%   jump in installations last year to 14.6 GW.To put that number into perspective, that's enough solar to   power 2.4 million homes in the U.S. On top of the huge   installation numbers, solar accounted for 39% of all new   electricity installed in 2016, a record for the industry. And   with costs coming down every year, the future looks bright for   the industry.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The solar industry's great yearThe chart below shows the solar industry's incredible growth   over the past six years. Every segment of the market has grown,   led by the utility-scale solar market.Data source: GTM Research / SEIAU.S. Solar Market Insight Report.This surge versus 2015 was driven by falling costs for solar   installations and contracts signed to be completed in 2016 before   the solar investment tax credit (ITC) was extended. It really   was the ITC that led to a massive boom in solar last year,   but it's also the reason solar stocks had a terrible 2016.What went wrong with solar stocksAcross the board, solar stocks had a rough year in 2016,   despite the installation boom.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) are all down significantly since the start of 2016.   And SolarCity would be in the same boat if it weren't for its   buyout byTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .SPWRdata byYCharts.The reason stocks are down is because the ITC extension meant   there were very few new contracts signed in 2016. The activity   that led to last year's boom in installations was a result of   contracts signed in 2014 and 2015, before the ITC extension was   signed. So, what investors were concerned about was the lack of   new contracts in the market.Even the residential market went through something of a   slowdown. Final numbers aren't out yet, but growth is likely in   the single or low double digits, driven by the lack of urgency to   install solar. Residential projects have a much shorter lead time   than utility projects, so the ITC extension hit the market as   early as the first quarter of 2016, whereas the impact of the ITC   won't be a drag on utility installations until 2017.What solar investors can expect in the futureWe've known for a few quarters now that 2017 will be bad for   the solar industry. Utility-scale projects will be hard to come   by domestically and even projects signed this year won't likely   begin construction until 2018 or beyond. And the 14.6 GW of solar   installed in 2016 will likely be the industry's peak until at   least 2018.But the good news is that solar energy is cheaper than   ever and it's now competing with fossil fuels on a cost   basis. Long term, that will lead to a tremendous amount of   growth, and companies like First Solar, SunPower, Vivint, Sunrun,   and Tesla should lead the way. It's going to be a bumpy ride,   though, to get to that growth on the horizon.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Wind and Solar May Have to Fill In for America's Crumbling Hydro Infrastructure;2/18/2017;"When politicians talk about ""crumbling infrastructure,"" it's   often hard to ascertain exactly what they're talking about. Is itbridges falling down, an excessive number of potholes, or maybe aging airports? It   could mean any number of things depending on who's talking and   who's listening.This week, an aging piece of infrastructure is acutely   impacting nearly 200,000 people in California as the Oroville   Dam's damaged spillways teeters close to collapse, potentially   flooding a large swath of northern California. The dam itself   doesn't (yet) appear to be damaged, but it's not functioning as   planned. And the problems aren't new given the fact that   environmental groups were pushing for additional spillway   construction 12 years ago at the now 49-year-old dam.   Incidentally, dams are only designed with a 50-year life span, so   it's worth keeping in mind that infrastructure isn't built to   last forever.Any kind of infrastructure goes through normal wear and tear   over time, but the challenge today is the sheer age of dam   infrastructure in the U.S. According to a 2015 Department of   Energy report, 75% of hydro capacity is at plants that are over   50 years old (although some have been upgraded since first   construction). The Oroville Dam's potential spillway collapse   could bring that age into focus, which could impact other sources   of renewable energy as well.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Crumbling dam infrastructureThe chart below is from the Department of Energy's 2014   Hydropower Market Report, which was released in April 2015. It   shows that a vast majority of U.S. hydro plants were built   between 1940 and 1970, particularly large plants.Image source: Department of Energy 2014 Hydropower Market     Report.If these plants begin to be reviewed more closely or are   decommissioned, it could take dozens of gigawatts of energy   production offline over the next decade. And given their age, it   may be a good idea to do just that.The crumbling hydro infrastructure may also be a new   opportunity for wind and solar energy in the U.S.. When you   consider that hydro power generated 249 million MWh of   electricity in 2015, the opportunity is enormous.Energy and the RPS standard conundrumHydro power is the biggest source of renewable energy in the   U.S., only recently surpassed by all other renewable energy   sources (excluding nuclear) combined. So, it's a big piece of the   energy industry.Image source: U.S. EIA.But it's also the biggest single part of state-level renewable   portfolio standards (RPS). In states like California, this is the   policy that has driven the growth in wind and solar over the past   decade. If you pull any hydro plant out of the mix, another   energy source has to fill that gap. And it will have to be clean   energy, so wind and solar fits the bill.A growth opportunity for solar energyLet's take the Oroville Dam as an example of the challenge and   opportunity for utilities, grid operators, and renewable energy.   If the 819 MW dam were to be taken offline, it would take about   3.5 GW of solar (which only produces energy about a quarter of   the time) to fill the gap. That compares to 14.6 GW being   installed in all of 2016, according to GTM Research, so large   dams are incredibly important to the country's electricity   infrastructure overall.But it wouldn't be crazy to think that over the course of the   next decade or two some of these hydro plants will be   decommissioned as they age. And to replace all hydro, about 114   GW of solar or wind would need to be installed to replace clean   energy with clean energy. RPSs would demand that wind and solar   would fill the gap, not fossil fuels.That's an incredible potential opportunity for developers likeFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , whether they're building solar plants or energy   storage to provide more predictable power output.The crumbling infrastructure opportunityWhat's going on at the Oroville Dam has an impact on years'   worth of energy planning, especially if the spillway collapses.   In California's RPS structure, a large hydroelectric dam couldn't   be taken offline without eventually being replaced by renewable   energy sources like wind and solar. And when you consider the   sheer age of the hydro infrastructure in the U.S., it could   create a huge hole other sources of renewable energy would need   to fill.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Model 3: How Many Will Be Delivered In 2017?;2/17/2017;"Going into electric-car makerTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter earnings release, here's the   biggest question: How many Model 3 vehicles will management say   it expects to deliver during the year? After all, we already know   Tesla has about 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the   $35,000 vehicles. But the big mystery is how Tesla's Model 3   production ramp-up will look -- and thus Model 3 deliveries.While investors may not get a very specific answer,   management's guidance range for total vehicle sales will likely   provide some useful insight into Tesla's outlook for the highly   anticipated, lower-cost vehicle.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Looking to guidanceIf Tesla follows its usual practice, it will provide an   outlook for expected full-year vehicle deliveries when it reports   itsfourth-quarter resultson Feb. 22, but it won't break down this forecast by model.   Still, investors can extrapolate from guidance for total   deliveries to get an idea of what management might expect from   Model 3.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long predicted it expects its   late-2015 launched Model X to eventually rival Model S   deliveries, bringing total Model S and Model X annual deliveries   to about 100,000 units. With this context, any guidance beyond   100,000 units in 2017 could presumably represent expected Model 3   deliveries.So, what sort of guidance range should investors expect from   Tesla management? While this may not be the answer investors are   hoping for, management will likely guide for a wide range of   possible outcomes. There's simply significant uncertainty   associated with forecasting a huge step change in vehicle   manufacturing.Musk explained the difficulty of forecasting Model 3   deliveries in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call:Another thing I really want to emphasize is the production     ramp tends to look like -- is exponential. Ultimately it is an     S-curve. An exponential goes to linear then goes to log. And     it's very difficult to predict exactly where that beginning     part of the exponential and the S-curve fits in between     quarterly reporting.A shift of even a few weeks one way or the other can have     quite a dramatic effect on what it looks like in that quarter,     but that's not indicative of the future. So we're telling you     what we -- we're giving you the best assessment we have short     of having a crystal ball.But Musk did provide some vision -- albeit very vague -- into   Tesla's expectations for Model 3, saying he thinks it will be an   ""exciting 2017."" Further, he said that Model 3 production will be   very uncertain in Q3 but ""gets pretty clear in Q4.""Why Tesla's guidance mattersShould investors even take Tesla's guidance seriously? I think   so.It's worth noting that, despite Tesla's well-documented   tendency to miss targets, its recent misses are relatively small   in relation to its rapidly growing targets. Even more, the   percentage gap between Tesla's initial annual guidance in recent   years and its actual deliveries isn't growing, despite extreme   growth in its targets.YearInitial GuidanceActual Vehicle DeliveriesDifference201320,00022,44212.2%201435,00031,655(9.6%)201555,00050,658(7.9%)201680,000-90,000*76,230(10.3%*)Total195,000180,985(7.2%)Asterisk indicates figure is calculated using a midpoint of a   guidance range. Table by author.Sure, there will likely be more uncertainty associated with   Tesla's guidance for 2017 deliveries than in previous years given   the guesswork even management will need to employ to predict   Model 3 deliveries. But Tesla's history of small misses on big   growth targets gives investors good reason to at least expect its   guidance to reflect a likelytrajectoryfor actual vehicle deliveries in 2017.Wait! What about those Model X delays?When forecasting Tesla's Model 3 production ramp-up in 2017   and beyond, it's probably tempting for investors to look to   Tesla's Model X delays and production challenges as a forewarning   for Model 3 production troubles. But there are several issues   with this reasoning.First, unlike the Model X, the Model 3 was designed from the   ground up for high-volume production. Second, the Model X is   an insanely complex vehicle, featuring never-before-manufactured   features like falcon wing doors, self-presenting front doors, the   largest front windshield in any vehicle, and monopost seats.Further, the Model X is the first fully-electric SUV ever   built. Indeed, it's arguably a borderline miracle that Tesla was   even able to achieve an annualized production run rate of 40,000   Model X units by the end of 2016.Model X. Image source: Author.In Tesla's third-quarter earnings call last year, Musk   specifically warned investors not to look to Model X as an   example of how Model 3 production could turn out:It's always tempting for people to reason by analogy instead     of first principles. And that would be the mistake of assuming     that anything to do with the X production has bearing on the     Model 3.They are very different programs with completely different     approaches. So I would not try to extrapolate from that, any     more than it would've made sense to extrapolate from the     Roadster when we were making 600 cars a year, to 20,000 cars a     year with the Model S....If you were to extrapolate from the Roadster experience, you     would be completely wrong about the Model S outcome, and many     people were. That's why I would say X is not relevant.Interestingly, for the first full calendar year of Model S   deliveries, Tesla actually exceeded its initial guidance for   20,000 vehicles, delivering 22,500 units. While achieving the   same sort of surprising outcome at Tesla's higher-volume   production today won't be easy, management is clearly confident   in a very steep production ramp-up for Model 3.Tesla vehicle production. Image source: Author.Another year of 50% growth?I'll be expecting Tesla to provide a guidance range of   approximately 110,000 to 130,000 units, representing about 50%   year-over-year growth in deliveries and around 10,000 to 30,000   Model 3 deliveries. However, since Tesla is expecting its   annualized production to increase from a run rate of 100,000   units today to an incredible 500,000 units in 2018, only 110,000   to 130,000 deliveries in 2017 would mean Tesla's first and second   quarter of 2018 will need to be characterized by the steep   portion of the S-curve.But this is how S-curves look. First, they're gradual; then,   they suddenly rise.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Five Major Myths about Options Trading;2/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();When it comes to investing, pretty much everyone has an opinion. While those opinions are great, sometimes investors will spread myths about subjects they don't have a firm understanding of. One of the most confusing subjects isoptions trading. Due to the many moving parts involved, investors find themselves befuddled and not knowing where to start. Here I'm going to debunk five major myths of options trading.Myth #1: Options are Riskier than StocksThis is one of those broad-based, blanket statements that does not tell the whole truth. People think options are riskier because you can lose 100% of your investment in an option. However, you can use options to limit your risk on trades.Here's an example, let's say you wanted to buy 100 shares ofTesla (TSLA)ahead of their earnings report next week because you think they are going to have a good report and the stock will go up. Today it would cost you around $270 per share or $27,000 to own 100 shares. If TSLA goes down 10% on its earnings report, you are going to lose $2,700 dollars. If it goes up 10%, you'll make $2,700.On the flipside, you could buy the March 17th$270 Call option for $1,350. If TSLA goes down 10% and stays there through expiration, you'll lose your $1,350. If it goes up 10%, you're call option will be worth at least $2,700, maybe more. If you wanted to define your risk as $2,700, you could buy two of these contracts, controlling 200 shares of Tesla rather than only 100. Same amount of nominal risk, but now your upside potential is doubled.Myth #2: You Need to be a Sophisticated Trader for OptionsThere certainly are options strategies that involve a great deal of complexity. With so many choices available to trade it can be very complicated. Each options expiration date has call options and put options of varying strikes available. At first glance the selection process can be daunting. Many stocks now have weekly options expiration, making these even more overwhelming for investors.You don't need a PhD in Applied Mathematics to use simple options strategies to make money and create income. For example, buying a call in the hopes that a stock goes up. If you know there is an event coming up that you think the stock will profit from, you can buy a call near the money on the stock and if it goes up you can profit. If you want to make a trade that benefits when the stock goes down, you can buy a put option in the hopes the stock goes down. Start with the basics and add more complex strategies as you become more comfortable.Myth #3: It Takes a Lot of Money to Trade OptionsThis couldn't be further from the truth. It's a lot less capital intensive to trade options than it is to buy 100 shares of your favorite stock. Most brokerage firms allow you to sell options premium, a more advanced strategy, in accounts that contain as little as $2,000. Compare that to Pattern Day Trader accounts which require at least $25,000.Trading options allows smaller accounts to gain exposure to more stocks for less money. You can diversify your options trades across many industries and many stocks simultaneously. There are even options on ETFs like theVolatility Index (VXX)so you can gain exposure to exotic financial instruments while managing your risk.Myth #4: Time is Always Working Against YouIf you are long or buy options then yes, there is a time value element that's working against you. However, there are simple ways to flip the script so this time works in your favor. One way is by using long call and long put spreads rather than buying a call or put outright. The other is to use credit spreads.A long call spread, or a bull call spread, is a two-legged options trade where a closer to the money option is purchased to open and a further out of the money call option is sold to open or shorted. This helps to drop the overall net debit or price of the call spread. It also limits the total profit potential of the trade.For example, if I bought a March 17th$67.50 Call onGilead (GILD)today it would cost me about $2.95. My upside potential would be unlimited but my breakeven would be the strike price plus the net debit which in this case is $2.95, making my breakeven $70.45.However, if I believe Gilead's upside is limited to $72.50, I could sell that $72.50 Call at the same expiration and take back some money, dropping my overall cost on the spread, therefore bringing down my breakeven. I could sell the $72.50 Call for 55c. Now my cost on the $67.50/72.50 Call spread is only $2.40, my breakeven now $69.90, and I'll make more money up to $72.50 than I would have with the long call by itself.Another example is the credit spread. Rather than buying the aforementioned spread, if I'm bearish on GILD I can sell the spread. So instead of spending $2.40 for the spread I would pocket $2.40. My risk would be the $5 difference in the strike prices, minus the $2.40 I took in premium. So I risk $2.60 to make $2.40. This credit spread would max out or give me the largest possible winning outcome of $2.40 if shares of GILD closed at or below $62.50 at expiration on March 17th.Myth #5: You Need a Special Account to Trade OptionsWell, sort of. While you do need to sign an options risk acknowledgement form and get your account approved specifically for options trading, it's not exactly a ""special account."" Pretty much any non-qualified, or non-retirement, account is eligible for options trading. I specify non-qualified because accounts like IRAs are restricted as to the type of options trading you can do since you can't short stocks in retirement accounts.There are several levels of options approvals out there, designed to save investors from themselves. Each level or tier is restricted, only allowing certain types of trading. Each broker has their own guidelines for what these levels look like. All you really need for approval is experience trading and capital. It's not like you have to be a millionaire or anything.Bottom LineThose are the five biggest myths about options trading that scare off potential traders. If you take the time to learn more about trading options, you'll find that they are a great way to manage your risk and gain exposure to the stock market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch Next Week;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe S&P 500 is currently worth $20 trillion for the first time ever, after gaining 25% over the last 12 months, and the Dow is inching quickly toward its own new all-time high. But, tech stocks have outperformed even more over the past year, with the Nasdaq posting 34% gains over the comparable time period.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrOf course, there's been plenty of variance in performance for individual stocks, while the tech world comes with even more risks and question marks. Next week, three big tech names - electric automakerTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), payments platformSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ) and wearables leaderFitBit Inc(NYSE:FIT) - will all report numbers for their most recent quarters on the same day: Feb. 22.Here's what investors should watch.3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch: Tesla (TSLA)Tesla has been on fire of late, gaining 60% over the last year and 27% just a month and a half into 2017. But, that momentum actually spurred a sell-off yesterday. Well, more specifically, it spurred a ""sell"" call from UBS analyst Colin Langan, which investors took to heart to the tune of a nearly 4% one-day drop.Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)For the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post a loss of 35 cents per share. While that's a smaller loss than what the company posted a year ago, Wall Street was actually expecting a profit as of three months ago.Plus, all estimates for TSLA stock have been getting worse. The loss on tap for next quarter has quadrupled in just three months; the loss on tap for next year has gone from 33 cents to $1.18. Thus, even an earnings beat would come over a lowered bar, which might act as an anchor on any potential pop.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Charged and Ready to GoFurther, while Tesla topped Wall Street's expectations last quarter, it missed by a wide margin the three prior. Langan said that he expects risk as a result of the company'sSolarCityacquisition, calling it a distraction from Model 3 test production, slated to begin on Feb. 20.3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch: Square (SQ)Square has also posted significant gains over the last 12 months, but in a slightly more dramatic fashion. SQ shares fell around 40% last spring, just six months after Square hit the public markets. But, the stock has been climbing out of that hole ever since. Add it up, and Square stock has still managed to gain upward of 50% in a year and is approaching its old highs.Source:Via SquareWill earnings be enough to propel Square to never-before-seen levels? The company has posted an ""earnings"" beat in the two most recent quarters - although there have been no earnings in sight, technically. Square is not yet profitable and is again on tap for a loss, this time to the tune of 7 cents per share.Investors betting on SQ are likely hoping for a buyout, though, making earnings less important than they would be for more established, profitable tech companies. Or they're playing the super long game, betting on the mega-trend of payments. Still, if the numbers disappoint widely, expect many folks who have just regained their losses to take the money and run3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch: Fitbit (FIT)While Tesla and Square both dropped a bit yesterday, Fitbit posted a nice 2% one-day gain. That's the good news. The bad news is that, unlike shares of the previous two companies, FIT stock has generally been headed nowhere but down.Source:Via FitbitFitbit stock has lost more than 56% of its value over the last 12 months, and that's just the extension of a trend that's existed for the last five years.And, FIT stock is moving in the wrong direction because, well, everything has been. This quarter, for instance, earnings are expected to end up 5 cents in the red vs. a profit three times as large the same time last year. Just three months ago, Wall Street was actually expecting earnings growth, too. Now, analysts expect the loss to come on the back of a 19% sales decline.Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win AgainFitbit is facing tough competition in the wearables space, and that's just the beginning of its problems. On top of that, the company is facing a legal battle withJawbone, which alleges the former stole employees and trade secrets.

3 Vanguard Treasury Bond Funds to Consider;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you want to invest in government bonds with Vanguard funds, there are a few primary ways to do it. You can invest in one of three Vanguard treasury bond funds, invest in one of their agency bond funds or invest in a Vanguard index fund that covers all types of government bond funds.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Today we'll focus on Vanguard funds that hold U.S. Treasury bonds. The three types of treasury bond funds that Vanguard offers are categorized by the primary bond durations, which include short term, intermediate term and long term.Investors who buy treasury bond funds are usually looking for exposure to a basket of bonds with high credit quality, which means the objective that suits this need is one of conservative income.In translation, investors looking for high yields aren't typically buyers of treasury bond funds.Vanguard Treasury Bond Mutual FundsVanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund(MUTF:VFISX): Vanguard's VFISX fund invests in U.S. Treasury bills, which are short-term bonds with durations that average about two years. Short-term treasury bonds typically have higher yields than money market funds but lower interest-rate risk than intermediate- and long-term bonds. Although they're not without market risk, short-term treasury bonds can be a good fixed-income choice for conservative investors. Expenses are 0.2% and the minimum initial investment is $3,000.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayVanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund(MUTF:VFITX): Vanguard's VFITX holds government debt in the form of intermediate-term U.S. Treasuries, which have an average duration of 5.3 years. Intermediate-term bond funds make good core holdings for the fixed-income portion of a portfolio because they generally kick off higher yields than short-term bond funds and carry less interest rate risk than long-term bond funds. The expenses for VFITX are 0.2% and the minimum initial investment is $3,000.Vanguard Long-Term Treasury Fund(MUTF:VUSTX): Vanguard's VUSTX invests in a basket of long-term Treasuries that average more than 15 years in duration. Over the long haul, investors can expect VUSTX to produce higher yields and better annual returns than its short- and intermediate-term counterparts, but they'll have to accept higher interest-rate risk along with them. For example, when interest rates are rising, prices for long-term bond funds tend to fall further than those with shorter average durations. VUSTX has an expense ratio of 0.2% and has a minimum initial investment of $3,000.As of this writing, Kent Thune did not personally hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.His No. 1 holding is his privately heldinvestment advisory firm.Under no circumstances does this information represent a recommendation to buy or sell securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Charged and Ready to Go5 High-Tech Cash Cows Yielding Up To 6%The post3 Vanguard Treasury Bond Funds to Considerappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Charged and Ready to Go;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) may not be competitors, but you can trade them as if they are. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();I am a fundamentally driven trader. Meaning I like to set my risk based on solid fundamentals. Tesla and Twitter are both perceived as risky bets. This is not a slight against either of them; I am merely saying that their fundamentals have yet to grow into their valuations. Tesla has a few obstacles ahead it. I get the potential but for now it's a speculative play in my book.A few days ago I suggestedclosing TSLA long profits and roll into TWTR longs. I did so because I didn't have room for both speculative trades in my portfolio. The move turned out to be an instant win as that day marked the high in TSLA and a coincided with a spike in TWTR.Click to EnlargeTesla Stock has a cult following. But on Thursday it caught a downgrade that caused a 3.9% drop.It won't be long before TSLA fans start touting great entry points. Personally, I reiterate my skepticism in its fundamentals so I won't be buying the stock.3 Dow Jones Stocks That Are Weighing You DownOn the other hand, I remain a fan of the TSLA stock price action. So, I like selling risk in Tesla options.I am always looking for opportunities to cautiously catch the falling knife. The easiest way I can do it is by repeating what has worked in TSLA, which is to sell risk against extreme opinions. I am not reckless so I always leave plenty of room for error since I never assume that I will pick the perfect time of entry. In this case, I will nibble with a first tranche trade then add to it as price unfolds.The Trade:Sell TSLA Jan 2018 $185 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collected $11.50 to open. The 30% price buffer gives me an 80% theoretical chance of success. My breakeven point is $173.5 per share. Selling naked puts is dangerous and is not suitable for all investors especially on a speculative high-priced stock. So I can modify this trade to carry less overall dollars at risk.The Alternate:Sell TSLA Jan 2018 $185/$180 credit put spread. For this collect $1 to open. If successful, this trade yields more than 25% on money risked. Selling a spread limits my maximum risk to the width of the spread less what I collect to open.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is Ready for a BreakoutI am not required to carry these trades through expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses. Selling naked puts is dangerous especially in markets hovering at all time highs. I only do it if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Closing the Deal With Time Warner Inc (TWX) Is a Must for AT&T Inc. (T);2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThough the intended merger ofTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) andAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) has beendoubted more than once since the idea was first floated in October, CEO Randall Stephenson assured AT&T stock owners that,not only would the deal be done this year, it would be ushered through without so much as a review by the FCC (as it turns out, AT&T isn't looking to garner Time Warner's licenses).makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrIs he right, and more importantly, do owners of T stock still want the TWX deal to go through? AT&T has so much else on its plate right now, not the least of which is regulatory uncertainty.As it turns out, not only is the pairing likely to win approval, AT&T needs it…badly.Business Is Getting TougherOn Friday, Stephenson said it bluntly, though accurately -wireless carriers are in an arms race. While he was specifically referencing the industry's capability to deliver digital constant over a limited number of airwave frequencies, his assessment could just as easily apply to the mechanics of delivering a wireless service.Case in point: On Monday, rivalVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) announced it wasre-introducing unlimited data plans, looking to garner (or recapture) wireless customers who have come to rely on handheld devices as media-delivery vehicles.AT&T will be forced to respond, which - one way or another - will stake money off the bottom line.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteAs T stock owners likely know all too well, there's no room for give. Last quarter,the company's revenue fell just a bit. Income fell considerably.The rise in operating expenses is abated after factoring in amortization and merger-related, but in light of the fact that theacquisition of DirecTV in May 2014was supposed to be a business building tool, anything but top-line growth is a disappointment - and a reflection of an increasingly competitive space.Is Time Warner the Answer?In other words, as wireless telecom service increasingly becomes a commodity and, as a result, becomes less profitable, what's AT&T to do to rekindle growth?Whether it's the best use of time and money remains to be seen, but the telecom giant believes the acquisition of video and music company Time Warner is the next best step.Those plans wereunveiled in October, with mixed responses. While investors love the idea of melding a studio with a new distribution channel, consumers and regulators were a bit more skeptical. The concern lies in the fact that such a pairing wouldgive AT&T not just control of how we consume media(AT&T is the nation's second-biggest wireless provider and third-biggest broadband service provider), but what media we even have access to. Time Warner is theparent of several key television channelsincluding HBO and CNN, as well as studio Warner Bros.Though it's technically a vertical integration and would theoretically be a mere coincidental pairing of content creation and content delivery, the opportunity for unfairness is undeniable even though pairing the media and the messenger would create efficiencies. Stephenson doesn't believe the union violates any antitrust standards, however, and not just because the team-up wouldn't include Time Warner's licenses.And if last quarter's results for Time Warner are any indication, owners of AT&T stock should be hoping the deal goes through. In its fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, the company earned $1.25 per share on revenue of $7.89 billion. Analysts were only looking for a profit of $1.19 per share and a top line of $7.75 billion. Both figures were up by double digits versus year-ago comparisons, and the Q4 report extends a long and pretty reliable string of growth.In other words, AT&T could use what Time Warner's got.Bottom Line for AT&T StockThe good news is, the merger with Time Warner is apt to proceed as planned, andthat's coming from a former FCC commissioner. The vertical-integration nature of the pairing rather than a horizontal one is the key.3 Stocks to Buy for Under $10 With 25%-Plus UpsideWhile the philosophical concerns of a potential monopoly aren't without merit, legally speaking, AT&T is right… there's no specific reason to assume that the company will abuse its relationship with a studio by limiting access to third-party entities. It's certainly pushing the envelope though. It's unlikely that antitrust law foresaw where communications technology and choice was going, with the lines between medium and media being this blurred.Either way, AT&T wants, and needs, this deal to get done.As of this writing, James Brumley held a position in AT&T (T).More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsTake Tesla Inc (TSLA) Profits, Pour Them Into Twitter Inc (TWTR)The postClosing the Deal With Time Warner Inc (TWX) Is a Must for AT&T Inc.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Isn’t Done Correcting Yet;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBusiness forNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be firing on all cylinders, but the charts of NVDA stock are showing a trend in motion that's a wee bit top-heavy. Thus, if you're looking to get on board one of the hottest stocks of the past year, I have a trade idea that helps discount some of the hype.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf we're to believe Nvidia's latest earnings report, it just doesn't get any better. It was a""great finish to a record year""as the company topped forecasts and bumped up guidance.But there lies the rub. NVDA stock is faced with the possibility of becoming a victim of its own success onandoff the price chart.Longer-term, Nvidia appears to be in all the right markets poised for secular growth. From autonomous vehicles to gaming to virtual reality to cloud computing, NVDA is well-positioned for continued success. You'll get no argument from me here.But Nvidia's success isn't exactly a secret at this point, and that's becoming a growing problem. For one, there's an inflated price for admission, with Nvidia stock sporting lofty ratios such as a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33, price-to-sales of 8.5 and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 3.4.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingPlus, NVDA now faces rising operating costs, potential gross margin compression, as well as data center, custom silicon and GPU workarounds competition.Nvidia could prove a very costly investment.Failing that, the chart of NVDA stock is warning that a day of reckoning is nigh.Nvidia Stock ChartClick to EnlargeWith NVDA shares up roughly 300% in the past 52 weeks, traders buying shares today are placing a lot of technical faith in extreme momentum continuing, rather than an overdue cycle of profit-taking beginning.In my view, bullishness at Nvidia's current price is misplaced.After 10 months of price action remaining tethered to Nvidia's upper Bollinger Band, shares are forming a bearish topping candle on the monthly chart. That's after hitting a brief and marginal all-time high in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report.Even the best-sounding, well-supported growth narratives eventually give way to meaningful price corrections, even if they eventually resume their rallies. I don't expect Nvidia stock to be an anomaly to that durable tendency.How to Trade NVDA Stock Right NowOne strategy that could allow you to profit from a correction in Nvidia and/or buy shares at a discount is an out-of-the-money credit put spread.I suggest the March $100/$95 put vertical.Trade of the Day: Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Waves a Bull FlagNVDA stock is at $108.90, and the trade is priced at 60 cents. The spread collects the full credit as long as shares aren't below $100 at expiration. That would require a decline of more than 8%, which would put Nvidia's total correction at 17%.We're looking to get paid as Nvidia diffuses its overbought condition. At the same time, the vertical does limit risk to $4.40 if the stock were to establish a stiffer correction below the protective $95 put strike.If we ultimately want to buy NVDA stock on weakness, the most we'll pay is $99.40.Also, if Nvidia establishes a larger (but still commonly corrective) move of 30% to $84.50 during the life of this vertical, the worst-case scenario is that our initial purchase price would work out to $89.90 through either assignment, or closing the spread and buying NVDA stock.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

4 Stocks to Buy Near 52-Week Lows;2/15/2017;"With U.S. stock markets trading near their all-time highs,   many companies' valuations have become a bit stretched. But there   arealwaysbargains to be found if you are willing to turn over enough   rocks. We asked a team of Fools to highlight a stock trading near   its 52-week low that they think is worth buying today. Read on to   see why they pickedAmerican Outdoor Brands(NASDAQ: AOBC) ,Gilead Sciences(NASDAQ: GILD) ,CVS Health(NYSE: CVS) , andFord(NYSE: F) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();This stock is under fire, but it's fighting backDan Caplinger(American Outdoor Brands): American Outdoor Brands isn't a familiar name to most   investors, but the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson   is well known as a premier gun manufacturer. The company decided   to change its name to highlight that it makes a variety of other   products in addition to its extensive gun offerings, such as   laser sighting systems, knives, tree saws, and tactical lighting   products. Moreover, American Outdoor Brands produces gun vaults   and accessories, along with gunsmithing and reloading tools.American Outdoor Brands has seen its stock fall recently, in   large part because of the results of the U.S. presidential   election in November. Many believed that the stock would climb if   the Democratic candidate had won, with expectations of stricter   gun control restrictions leading many gun enthusiasts to make   purchases prior to any such regulations taking effect. However,   with the victory of President Trump, the urgency among gun buyers   is gone, and investors fear that American Outdoor Brands will see   sales suffer as a result.However, American Outdoor Brands' strategy to emphasize its   broader product line should help it sustain growth in the long   run. Even if sales fall now, American Outdoor Brands has the   quality and brand awareness to prosper for long-term   investors.The cash to cure what ails itMatt DiLallo(Gilead Sciences): Shares of biotech giant Gilead Sciences have   stumbled over the past year, dropping more than 35%. The stock   recently hit another 52-week low after reporting disappointing   fourth-quarter earnings, with no clear signs of a turnaround in   sight. The culprit is declining sales of its hepatitis C   franchise, which isn't expected to turn around anytime soon.That said, Gilead still managed to generate a whopping $16.7   billion of operating cash flow last year. It returned most of   that cash to shareholders, buying back $11 billion in stock and   paying $2.5 billion in dividends. The company also recently   increased the dividend by 10% thanks to that copious cash flow.   Even with those increasing shareholder returns, the company was   able to add to its cash position, which stood at $32.4 billion at   the end of last year.That cash position might be just the medicine that cures the   company's ailing sales because it could use it to make a   meaningful acquisition, such as acquiring a company with a   compelling late-stage drug pipeline or a fast-selling drug. If   Gilead can find the right deal, it could halt the stock's slide   by giving investors a reason to be optimistic that sales   can grow once again.Political attention = opportunityBrian Feroldi(CVS Health): Changes are coming to the Affordable Care Act, while   politicians have been accusing pharmacy benefit managers such as   CVS Health for driving up the cost of drugs. Mix in competitive   pressure that caused the company tocut its guidance, and it is easy to understand why CVS's shares have been tossed   into the discount bin.While 2017 looks as if it'sgoing to be a wash, I can't help feeling good about this company's prospects over   the long term. Baby boomers are retiring in droves, which should   drive prescription volume growth for years to come. CVS Health's   in-store MinuteClinics are a hit with consumers, and there's   plenty of room left for expansion. TheTargetand Omnicare integrations are going well, and sales of specialty   drugs are growing nicely. That's a lot of good things happening   for a stock trading near its 52-week low.Meanwhile, the company continues to crank out cash flow that   it generously passes back to shareholders in the form of a rising   dividend and share buybacks. Yet CVS Health's depressed share   price has pulled its valuation down to 13.5 times forward   earnings. With a strong competitive position and a market-beating   yield of 2.5%, this is a terrific stock to buy at today's   dirt-cheap valuation.The forgotten automakerTravis Hoium(Ford): Automakers not namedTeslaare having a hard time getting any love in today's stock market.   Ford has made vast improvements in the quality and attractiveness   of its vehicles since the recession subsided, and now it's   churning profits quarter after quarter. And no one seems to   care.F Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsWhat's impressive about Ford today is that it's profiting from   the market's trends (SUVs and trucks) while investing in future   technologies such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving.   Don't mistake the fact that Ford isn't showing off the latest   0-to-60 times as a sign that it's falling behind: Ford is working   on autonomous vehicles in a big way.The company recently showed off its second-generation   autonomous Ford Fusion, a surprisingly normal-looking vehicle,   and invested $1 billion in Argo AI to develop commercial   ride-sharing fleets by 2021. On top of that, 90 autonomous Ford   Fusions will be on the road this year across the U.S. and   potentially Europe, refining autonomous technology.Ford is a leading automaker of the future, while still being a   cash machine today. And that's a big reason investors should love   the stock near its 52-week low.10 stocks we like better than Gilead SciencesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Move Over China: India's the Best Place to Invest Right Now;2/14/2017;"(1:30) - Apple to begin iPhone manufacturing in India(6:15) - Tesla speculates opening the doors into India's   Market(9:15) - Internet Expansion   in India(13:35) - Amazon's Big Investment into India(21:30) - India's influencing infrastructure(25:25) - Stock Re-capWelcome to Episode #70 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Neena Mishra, Zacks Director of ETF Research and also the editor ofZacks Income Investor.But she's not on the show this week to talk about ETFs or income stocks. No, she's joining Tracey to discuss a far more important topic: the investing opportunities in India.Neena just returned from a trip to India where she noticed that there was a lot more optimism about the economy.Prime Minister Modi has been trying to institute economic reforms to open up India's economy, which has been notoriously closed off to foreign investment. Given the developments over the last few years, it looks like he is succeeding.While many American technology and social media companies are shut out of China for various reasons, India has seemingly opened its doors. With 1.2 billion people, and growing, many companies would love to tap that consumer base.With one of the largest populations of Millennials in the world, and a growing middle class, 2017 could be the year of India.Tracey and Neena discuss 5 ways in which investors can invest in India's rising economic power, without even leaving the shores of the United States.5 Stocks to Play the Indian Growth Story1.AppleAAPLonly has 2% of India's smartphone market. Estimated at 300 million, and growing, that's just a small sliver of the market. But until 2017, it hasn't been able to open Apple retail stores in the country. Thanks to a deal to manufacture the phones in India, which will bring costs of the phones down for consumers, Apple could soon be tapping India's growing elite.2.TeslaTSLAappears to be poised to enter the India market after CEO Elon Musk tweeted out in February 2017 that it is looking to enter India in mid-2017. There are also rumors that a long-awaited Tesla Asia manufacturing plant may get the green light in India, instead of China. Stay tuned.3.FacebookFBhas long been shut out of the massive Chinese market, but that's not the case in India. One problem in India, however, has been the poor Internet infrastructure. There are just 250 million data subscribers, although that number is growing quickly. In 2016, Facebook tried to give away the Internet in India but was shot down by the government. However, data companies have been quickly expanding which is helping Facebook's reach. In the fourth quarter of last year, India was Facebook's fastest growing market.4.AmazonAMZNhas put the most on the line in India as it has already spent about $5 billion to expand its fulfillment centers and delivery service in the country. Amazon Prime has launched in 100 cities. 10% of India's population speaks English, which makes it the second largest English speaking country, after the United States, in the world. It's facing competition, however, from Alibaba and homegrown FlipKart and Snapdeal. But it has launched Amazon Video and a recent 3-day Great Indian Sale saw sales growth surge over 200% compared to a regular shopping day.5.NetflixNFLXhas an aggressive international expansion plan, and it includes India. In December 2016, just as Amazon Video launched, Netflix announced a partnership with Bollywood movie star and producer, Shah Rukh Khan. Right now, Neena says Netflix is charging around $10 a month for its streaming service. That is high for India. But, again, companies are looking at the growth potential.What else should you know about India and investing in its hot growth story in 2017?Find out the answers to this and more on this week's podcast.Zacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitmakeArticleAd();Today you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Tesla Shares Near Record High As It Reaffirms Mass-Market Model 3 Production;2/14/2017;"Tesla, Inc.TSLA, formerly Tesla Motors, Inc., shares neared an all-time high on Monday after the electric car manufacturer reaffirmed its plans to launch its first mass-market car, the Model 3, in late 2017.Tesla shares rose 4% Monday, and it is up 2.76% in Tuesday trading to $283.46. Now, the company, which nearly fell off a cliff in February 2016, looks poised to regain some momentum ahead of its biggest undertaking to date.Tesla will reportedly start to buildpre-production versions of its $35,000 Model 3 sedan in mid-2017, as the company attempts to begin fulfilling the 373,000 pre-orders. Consumers placed faith in Elon Musk's company by putting down $1,000 deposits for the new vehicles starting in Spring 2016. Tesla plans to roll out the Model 3 all the way through 2018.Model S third quarter sales jumped 59%in the U.S. year-over-year, claiming nearly a third of the luxury sedan market. Overall,fourth quarter sales rose 27%.Despite falling just short of its goal to deliver 80,000 vehicles,Morgan Stanley analysts placed their faith in Teslalast month. And since December, Tesla shares have risen by nearly 60%.Musk, Tesla's chairman and largest shareholder stated his hopes to produce 500,000 electric vehicles a year by the end of 2018 and 1 million by 2020.Other MovesThe company announced on Monday it isready to enter the Middle East market. Tesla will begin to accept online orders for its Model S sedan and Model X SUV from the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is expected to get a Tesla pop-up store and a service center by July. Tesla has similar plans for Abu Dhabi by 2018. The move puts the company in the potentially large Middle Eastern luxury car market.Oil prices have fallen in the last two years, which could prompt a shift in regional driving practices. UAE just announced a free-to-use electric vehicle road with charging stations.Musk is currently being courted to bring a Tesla plant to his home country of South Africa. And he recently announced intentions tobring Tesla to India.Tesla has also started to invest in sustainability far beyond electric cars.Its $2.1 billion acquisition of solar power giant SolarCity has allowed the company to expand its business model. Tesla is now investing heavily in solar power and sustainable battery technology in order to expand its new energy business.And Musk wants to begin tocolonize Mars by 2024. So conquering the electric car market doesn't seem all that difficult by comparison.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?makeArticleAd();Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Tesla;2/14/2017;"AtHoldings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 48 most recent 13F filings for the 12/31/2016 reporting period, and noticed that Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA) was held by 16 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose theirlongpositions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose theirshortpositions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the storybecause the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.makeArticleAd();Having given that caveat, we believe that looking atgroupsof 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in TSLA positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:FundNew Position?Change In Share CountChange In Market Value($ in 1000's)Fort Point Capital Partners LLCExisting-3,222-$508Reynders McVeigh Capital Management LLCNEW+1,543+$330California State Teachers Retirement       SystemExisting+8,900+$4,319Jaffetilchin Investment Partners LLCExisting+3,560+$1,019Blue Ridge Capital L.L.C.ExistingUNCH+$1,558Graticule Asia Macro Advisors LLCNEW-27,000-$5,770Marathon Trading Investment Management       LLCExisting-3,428-$751IFP Advisors IncExisting+383+$118Moon Capital Management LPNEW-10,000-$2,137Lenox Wealth Management Inc.ExistingUNCH+$3Bamco Inc.

Worth noting is thatHoplite Capital Management L.P., included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited TSLA common stock as of 12/31/2016.Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the TSLA share count in the aggregate amongallof the funds which held TSLA at the 12/31/2016 reporting period (out of the 2,765 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of TSLA shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for TSLA. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 5,356,450 shares in the aggregate, from 51,255,183 up to 56,611,633 for a share count increase of approximately 10.45%.

While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total acrossgroupsof funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA).10 S&P 500 Components Hedge Funds Are Buying   »"

Go Long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock … With Insurance!;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast year's turnaround inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is back in play and looking good for investors. But with key product rollouts looming, don't be too Zen about the trend being your friend. Instead, control your destiny with a little insurance against AMD stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrAs I wrotelast monthin front of earnings, 2016 was the best of times for AMD stock, and for good reason. Of course, 2017 is looking good as shares continue to gain on the company's improving business trend. Shares were catapulted to new multiyear highs after fourth-quarter earnings topped Wall Street's views.Still, the rest of the year is looking like make-or-break time for the semiconductor outfit for two reasons: Ryzen and Vega.Ryzen is set to be released in early March as Advanced Micro Devices' new CPU for PCs and servers. The main competition is chip giantIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) - a company facing itsown design challengesand whose manufacturing lead will shrink markedly with the release of Ryzen.On the conference call, Advanced Micro Devices teased investors, stating it had secured a number of high-end PC design wins for Ryzen, which is based on AMD's next-gen Zen CPU core architecture.Advanced Micro Devices is also releasing its Vega GPU line in 2017. The product is expected to come to market during the second quarter and has its sights on gaining market share in the server and high-end PC markets.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe big competition in this space isNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Nvidia's software dominance will be a substantial challenge for AMD to crack, but one it's readying for with an open-source approach.Advanced Micro Devices must successfully execute for AMD stock to have any chance to keep building on its red-hot 2017. If not, it would undo a significant amount of price action.AMD Stock ChartClick to EnlargeSince discussing AMD back in January (yellow oval highlight), shares have confirmed what we saw as a fairly common corrective move by blasting higher to new multiyear highs.It goes without saying that the price action has been very generous for AMD investors. But notwithstanding the company's obvious business risks, there's no reason to believe the stock's bullish trend won't still be friendly, and won't still improve.The better part of last week has been spent digesting the bullish gains in AMD stock, though not to point of finding support from an overbought stochastics. It's a minor concern. My technical point of view? AMD's constructive price action and potential for improvement outweighs this secondary price indicator.How to Trade AMD Stock Right NowWith AMD stock at $13.58, I like the April $17/$12 collar.The collar - priced for $13.78, or 20 cents over a naked long stock purchase - allows for guaranteed downside protection at $12 and amounts to an effective stop-loss of about 13%.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman's $150 TargetThe insurance policy afforded by the $12 put is stationed a few percent below December's highs in AMD and pennies under the post-earnings closing print. The protection could come in handy.If bullish momentum does prevail, profits are initially capped by the $17 call. At April expiration, that works out to a gain of more than 23% if shares are at or above the sold strike. Those profits nearly double the downside risk for a premium of just 20 cents.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Monday’s Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI);2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trending higher this morning, as Wall Street looks toward softening trade rhetoric from the White House on Japan and China. Furthermore, while there is a lack of economic data, President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On the corporate front,Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is making headlines after offering its first unlimited wireless data plan since 2011.makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.27%, withS&P 500futures rising 0.22% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.16%.On the options front, volume was brisk on Friday, with about 17.3 million calls and 14.8 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.70, but the 10-day moving average ticked lower to 0.70.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) saw mixed options activity and dropped 2.4% on Friday despite posting record holiday quarter earnings results. Meanwhile,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) puts were active after the company logged its 10th straight year-over-year drop in quarterly revenue andActivision Blizzard, Inc.(NASDAQ:ATVI) announced blowout results and a $1 billion buyback program.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)Nvidia traders were looking for a reason - any reason - to take profits off the table after the stock returned to all-time-high territory near $120 last week. And they got it inThursday night's quarterly report. Despite record earnings of 99 cents per share and sales of $2.2 billion - both of which beat Wall Street's targets of 83 cents per share on revenue of $2.1 billion - traders instead focused on Nvidia's conservative first-quarter guidance of $1.9 billion (plus or minus two percentage points), versus expectations for $1.88 billion.NVDA stock dropped nearly 2.4%, pushing the shares below their 10-day moving average and driving heavy put volume heading into the weekend. In total, NVDA saw 828,000 contracts cross the tape on Friday, with puts and calls nearly split on the session.That said, NVDA is still trading north of peak Feb call and put open interest at $110, which totals 9,000 and 14,000 contracts, respectively. Additionally, while put adds were seen building at the Feb $107 strike, so too were traders targeting the Feb $115 call strike. Once profit taking plays out, NVDA should begin to move higher once again.Twitter Inc (TWTR)TWTR stock continued to see fallout from itsdisastrous fourth-quarter earnings report. The struggling social media firm logged its 10th straight year-over-year quarterly decline and its slowest revenue growth since it went public four years ago.Many TWTR bulls were hoping that Twitter would get a ""Trump bump"" from the political stir President Donald Trump has caused since his election, but ad revenue from the increased Twitter attention didn't materialize.The poor report sent many scrambling for the exits, and TWTR options traders flooded the stock with puts on Friday. Total volume rose to 609,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 55% of the day's take. Twitter is now trading at its lowest point since June last year, with the dip below $16 threatening to push the stock below peak Feb put OI of nearly 20,000 contracts at the $15 strike.And there are plenty of put traders looking for just such a break later this week, with 11,800 Feb $13 put contracts and another 7,200 puts open at the Feb $14 strike. TWTR stock is trading slightly higher in premarket action this morning, and it may be only a matter of time before takeover and buyout rumors start swirling once again.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI)With graphics chip makersAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia reporting record holiday profits, it should come as no surprise that one of the largest video game makers in the world would also post a blowout quarter. Activision Blizzard said itearned 92 cents per share in the fourth quarter, besting the consensus by 19 cents. Revenue also topped the Street's view, coming in at $2.45 billion.Trade of the Day: Play a Torrid Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock RallyBut while ATVI surged nearly 19% on Friday, options traders didn't appear to be chasing the stock. Total volume came in at 316,000 contracts, with calls only managing 52% of the day's take. In fact, puts easily outnumber calls in the Feb series, indicating that ATVI options traders are looking for a correction or a pullback in short order.That said, ATVI is trading well north of all major call and put OI in both the Feb and March series, and it could be a bit before options traders adjust to the stock's new perch in the $47 region.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Activision Blizzard, Inc.

(VZ);2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe earnings calendar is slowly thinning out, with just a couple more weeks of heavy reporting before we reach the unofficial offseason. Still, there's plenty out there to move the markets - including a 1-2 punch of President Trump tweets and executive orders.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Heading into Monday's trade,Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) joined the earnings fray, whileTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) created some headlines of their own over the weekend.Here's what you should know heading into Monday:Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA)TEVA shares were up strongly in Monday's premarket action thanks to a Street-beating fourth-quarter report.The generic pharma outfit reported a loss of $1.10 per share, but backing out certain items, adjusted profits of $1.38 per share were 3 cents better than the Wall Street consensus mark. That came on revenues of $6.5 billion, which was more than enough to clear estimates of $6.25 billion, and represented 33% growth year-over-year.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveInvestors also were encouraged by Teva's full-year outlook, which included adjusted earnings of $4.90 to $5.30 on revenues of $23.8 billion to $24.5 billion. The lower end of each range was enough to beat expectations of $4.83 in profits on $23.69 billion in revs.Heading forward, Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg says the company will be focused on ""extracting synergies related to the Actavis Generics transaction,"" referring to the$40.5 billion buyout that closed last year.TEVA shares were up about 5% in Monday's premarket trade.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla has been making moves outside the U.S. as the electric carmaker seeks to become a force globally.TSLA is making waves in the Middle East as Tesla will make its official launch in Dubai at the same time as the World Government Summit in Dubai, which CEO Elon Musk will attend.The first Tesla store in Dubai will open this coming summer on Shiekh Zayed Road, ""one of the busiest roads in Dubai,"" according toElectrek.

Trade of the Day: Play a Torrid Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Rally;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEDITOR'S NOTE: Sam Collins will return on Feb. 21.makeArticleAd();After closing higher in nine out of the past 10 weeks, shares ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) are fast approaching the all-time highs at the $290 level. Most of the recent near-parabolic move has been predicated on hopes for the ramp-up in production for the Model 3.Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)TSLA, however, has a history of over-promising and under-delivering. I think the stock has come too far, too fast and is ripe for a pullback.Certainly the stock has been huge performer since early December, tacking on a very impressive 50% gain in that time frame. Shares are reaching extremely overbought levels on a technical basis, with nine-day RSI readings over 85. Previous instances when Tesla stock reached such levels of euphoria proved to be short-term tops in the stock.TSLA is also positioned right at the critical $270 resistance level.A longer-term weekly technical take paints an even more ominous picture. The last four times Tesla was at such overbought levels on a weekly basis were significant tops in the stockMuch of the recent move higher in Tesla can likely be attributed to short covering. With short interest now dropping from the recent record highs, it will take more than short covering to propel TSLA to all-time highs.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveEarnings are due Feb. 22, withexpectations of a 30 cent loss on revenues of $2.2 billion. Important to remember that Tesla also missed delivery numbers in 2016, delivering only 76,000 cars versus guidance in the 80,000 to 90,000 range. Once again a case of the hope exceeding reality.With TSLA stock now just below the all-time highs at $290, the real question is how much is faith worth.

The Chevy Bolt EV Gets Off to a Strong Sales Start;2/12/2017;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has talked about creating an   affordable electric car for more than a decade. That car -- the   Model 3 -- is finally taking shape. Test production could begin   within the next few weeks, and Tesla hopes tobegin mass production this summer. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of potential customers have   put down $1,000 refundable deposits to reserve a place in   line.However,General Motors(NYSE: GM) has beaten Tesla to the punch with its own affordable   electric car, the Chevy Bolt. The 2017 Chevy Bolt went on sale in   December and is selling quite well so far. It may not match the   Model 3 in terms of total sales, but the Bolt is on its way to   becoming a key part of GM's vehicle lineup.A bolt from the blueTesla has been talking up the Model 3 -- at least conceptually   -- for a very long time. A few years ago, it set 2017 as a target   for beginning production.makeArticleAd();Tesla still hopes to start delivering the Model 3 sedan     later this year. Image source: Tesla Motors.Thus, most industry observers were shocked when GM showcased   the Bolt concept car in early 2015 and then quickly confirmed   that it would go into production with an on-sale date of late   2016. This allowed the Chevy Bolt to make it to marketbefore the Model 3.The Chevy Bolt offers an impressive EPA-estimated 238 miles of   range. It has a starting price of $37,495 and is eligible for a   $7,500 federal tax credit. (Some states, including California,   offer additional tax credits.) Furthermore, most reviews of the   Bolt have been quite positive and have confirmed that the   advertised 238-mile range holds up in real-world driving   conditions.Strong sales out of the gateThe first Chevy Bolts arrived on dealer lots in December. GM   dealers delivered 579 Bolts to customers that month. In January,   availability improved modestly and sales doubled to 1,162   units.That may not seem like much compared to the nearly 200,000   vehicles GM dealers delivered in the U.S. during January.   However, the Bolt is only available in two states so far:   California and Oregon. (To be fair, electric vehicles are   particularly popular in those states.) Furthermore, inventory   remains extremely low, with Chevy Bolts spending just seven days   on dealers' lots on average.GM plans to gradually roll the Chevy Bolt out to more states   over the course of this year. It will be available in most West   Coast and Northeast markets by the spring, with nationwide   availability scheduled for September.The Chevy Bolt will be available nationwide by September.     Image source: General Motors.Considering the strong initial demand for the Bolt, sales   could far exceed anything the plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt has   managed over the last six years. In 2016, GM delivered 24,739   Volts, which was a new record for the model.A key piece of the puzzleThe Chevy Bolt is likely to remain a relatively low-volume   model for GM. However, as the company's first fully electric car,   it could prove to be very important for the General.First, even if it isn't as cool as Tesla's Model 3, the Bolt   may serve as a halo car for the Chevrolet brand, improving its   image among environmentally conscious consumers and bringing more   people into dealerships.Second, if the Chevy Bolt sells relatively well, it will help   General Motors meet the EPA's aggressive fuel economy targets in   the coming years. Full-size trucks and SUVs generate the lion's   share of GM's profit and will continue to do so. However, in   order to continue churning out those gas-guzzlers, GM also has to   produce some fuel-efficient vehicles. With a 119 MPG-equivalent   rating, the Bolt goes a long way in this regard.Third, some states -- most notably, California -- require   automakers tobuy zero-emission vehicle creditsif they don't produce enough electric vehicles. The Chevy Bolt   should reduce or eliminate GM's need to buy these ZEV credits   from rivals like Tesla. (Not surprisingly, the Bolt will be   available in all 10 states on the ZEV credit system by May.)It's still early in the rollout of the Chevy Bolt. However, so   far, everything seems to be going to plan. As a General Motors   shareholder, I will be paying close attention to the Chevy Bolt's   sales trend as availability improves during the course of   2017.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

In Case You Missed It, This Hasn't Happened in the Solar Industry in 16 Years;2/11/2017;"The solar industry has been on a growth streak for the past 16   years and is now a formidable force in energy. But this year may   finally see the growth streak come to an end.According toGTM Research, 2017 is expected to see a 7% decline in installations from 74   GW to 69 GW. This would be a significant downturn after years of   growth, but it's not all that surprising to industry observers.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) , and even shares ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) in SolarCity were all hammered by this decline   before the calendar turned to 2017.While this year may be bad for solar energy, it may be the   calm before a wave of installations hits starting in 2018. And if   you look out on the horizon the solar future looks to be getting   brighter everyday.makeArticleAd();Solar installations like this one have become more and more     common around the world in the past decade. Image source: Getty     Images.A series of unfortunate eventsThe decline in installations in 2017 will be driven by a   number of negative events all hitting at once. There was an   urgency that drove a boom in installations in 2016 when the   investment tax credit (ITC) in the U.S. was set to expire, but   the extension in late 2015 took away any urgency for utilities to   sign solar contracts for 2017. Long-term, the extension will lead   to more solar installations, but not until the 2018-2021   timeframe.China will also be a drag after installing a record 34.2 GW of   solar (enough to power 5.6 million U.S. homes) in 2016 according   to the Chinese National Energy Administration. No one quite knows   how much solar will be installed in China in 2017, but the NEA   only plans to average 27.5 GW of installations over the next four   years so it's safe to say installations will be down.Japan is another country where the solar industry is in for a   rough year. According to GTM Research, an estimated 10.2 GW of   solar was installed in Japan in 2016, but that will drop to 8.8   GW in 2017 as feed-in tariff reductions hit. Japan is a high   potential solar market, but public policy hasn't kept up with   potential and that will keep a cap on growth short-term.Why growth is on the horizonWhile these factors in the U.S., China, and Japan will drive a   decline in solar installations in 2017, that doesn't mean the   industry is heading into a dark chapter. Solar energy has never   been cheaper and bids for new power plants are coming in under 4   cents per kWh in some locations, a price that would beat any new   fossil fuel or nuclear plant on a cost basis.Image source: SunPower.Emerging markets like Chile, Mexico, Argentina, India, and the   Middle East are starting to see the potential of solar as well.   Mexico's recent auction resulted in clean energy contracts with   an average price of 3.3 cents per kWh and given the low cost many   countries are following with their own reverse auctions in 2017.   Nearly four dozen countries could have energy auctions this year   and that would lead to a boom in demand in 2018 and beyond.Solar energy is cost effective today, but energy projects have   this lag between when people decide to go solar and when projects   are in the ground. That's the lull the market is in today.   Leading developers like First Solar, SunPower, and Canadian Solar   could will their backlog in 2018 and 2019, despite having a down   year in 2017.Solar energy is still the future of energyOver the past decade alone, solar energy has grown from a 2 GW   industry that could install enough power generation to power   368,000 homes per year to an industry giant that installed 74 GW,   or enough to power 12.1 million homes, in the last year alone.   And growth was driven by a whopping 90% drop in solar panel costs   as technology improves across the industry.2017 may be a down year for the solar industry for a variety   of reasons, but it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that   solar energy is the most abundant energy source in the world and   the cost to generate solar power is now lower than fossil fuels   in most of the world.Like it or not, the solar boom is really just beginning and   2017 will be a calm before what could be another 16 years of   consecutive growth for solar energy.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Today is Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, so we're   talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I'm your host,   Sean O'Reilly, and joining me today in studio is the man   with the plan, Mr. Taylor Muckerman. What's up, sir?Taylor Muckerman:Going accordingly.O'Reilly:Going accordingly? Most well?Muckerman:So far. Don't mess it up.O'Reilly:Is your day adequate?Muckerman:Yeah. I had to get in here a little earlier than I planned   this morning.O'Reilly:Really? How was the train?Muckerman:Busier than normal. Rush hour.O'Reilly:Do you have an open coming up? What's up?Muckerman:No, just, all-team meeting for the international side. We   got folks in Australia and the U.K. that we have to consider   in the time frames, also Singapore. So you can't do it at   noon.O'Reilly:Oh, man. Do you Skype them in?Muckerman:Yeah. If Skype works.O'Reilly:That's the eternal question.Muckerman:We go through the rotation of Skype, Slack, Google Hangouts   -- they all fry on different days.O'Reilly:Can you believe thatMicrosoftpaid $8 billion for Skype? Think about that.Muckerman:I cannot. They could have paid me $8 billion and I'd done   the same thing.O'Reilly:Eight followed by nine zeros, and it's not the best   program.Muckerman:It's not.O'Reilly:Anyway. Should we talk about energy and stuff, or ... ?Muckerman:That's what you had planned, right?O'Reilly:Yeah, well, you're the man with the plan. So, Mr.   Muckerman, according to a new report from the Environmental   Defense Fund's Climate Corps Program --Muckerman:Say that one more time?O'Reilly:Environmental Defense Fund's Climate Corps Programs. Say that   five times fast.Muckerman:No, that's all you.O'Reilly:Environmental Defense Fund's Climate Corps Program. Environmental   Defense Fund's Climate --Muckerman:All right, what did they have to say?O'Reilly:It was actually kind of cool. The solar and wind industries   are apparently creating jobs at a rate of 12 times   faster than the rest of the U.S. economy. That's actually   kind of significant. It's not even off a small base. This is   millions of jobs.Muckerman:Yeah. It's up to, roughly, about 4.5 million jobs in the U.S.,   from 3.5 in 2011.O'Reilly:Yeah. And we have a population of 320   million, about a little over 100 million in the workforce   this year. This is not small potatoes anymore.Muckerman:Yeah, and if it continues growing near the 20% that it   has been in recent years, we're going to see some very   meaningful growth. These numbers are going to continue to   grow.O'Reilly:I have to learn how to install solar panels.Muckerman:Something like that.O'Reilly:But for this reason, this growth that we're seeing, I   naturally started to wonder where, this renewable-energy   project, where is this usage common? You hear stories about   how Las Vegas is all renewable now, Hawaii, you go to   Hawaii and apparently solar is everywhere. So I started to   wonder, where is this more common than not? Because here in   Virginia, we have a lot of natural gas-fired plants, some   from Ohio; I'm sure there's a coal fire plant there   somewhere still --Muckerman:Not a new one. Only about 0.17% of all new electric   generating capacity last year came from coal.O'Reilly:Is that, like, a guy burning coal in his shed out back?Muckerman:I think that's what that amounts to. 0.17%. Yeah.   Only 45 megawatts.O'Reilly:Wow. Anyway. We dove in and looked around the world and saw   where it was pretty common, and we found a few surprises, and a   few other places that we're not so surprising. What do you   think -- should we start with the U.S. and then the world, or   vice versa?Muckerman:America first!O'Reilly:America first, all right, perfect. Let's break it down.   What's going on in America?Muckerman:You're seeing it crop up everywhere -- that's   renewable, not just solar. When you look at all new energy   capacity added last year in 2016, we're looking   at about 26 gigawatts were added, and 61.5% came from   biomass, waste, heat, solar, wind, or hydro. Nearly   two-thirds. Another third came from natural gas, which, on   the fossil-fuel side, is the cleanest of the three, meaning   oil, coal, or natural gas. So, arguably, what was that,   94.5% is generally clean, almost two-thirds is renewable. That's   a pretty big move.O'Reilly:I have to ask, because a lot of companies are starting to invest   in this. You have the yieldcos, like8point3 Energy Partners; you haveSunEdison [Yieldco's TerraForm Power and TerraForm   Global].Muckerman:MidAmerican Energyhas one of the largest wind projects in   Iowa, generating 301 megawatts.O'Reilly:Owned by Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) .Muckerman:Name drop.O'Reilly:I had to.Muckerman:It's fine. He's in it. They're in it.O'Reilly:Did you see that special, by the way?Muckerman:I did not, but it has been talked about here at The Fool. What   was it, PBS? HBO?O'Reilly:It was HBO. It's mostly about his personal life.Muckerman:OK. Just a lot of Diet Coke or actual Coke?O'Reilly:And breakfast atMcDonald'severy day.Muckerman:Perfect. Living to be 100.O'Reilly:We are not being compensated by HBO at all, to   our listeners. We're talking about HBO'sBecoming Warren Buffett, it aired on the 30th.Muckerman:Oh, you didn't get a free subscription?O'Reilly:No. I'm going to watch it this weekend. Actually, I probably   will sign up for the free trial. Anyway, bottom line, I   actually knew this stuff had a future when Buffett started   investing in windmills. I was like, ""Oh, this is actually   economical,"" because he does not do things that are not   going to make him money. We saw that one statistic about Alaska.   What's up with those guys?Muckerman:When you think Alaska, you think oil, generally. They have a lot   of it; they're producing a lot of it. And kodiaks, and stuff   like that. But this is a state that, they basically give a   paycheck to all their citizens from all the oil revenues   that they make on an annual basis. And what they're seeing is,   solar and wind is actually cheaper in a lot of places than   oil and diesel, because you're looking at some   places, the more remote areas of Alaska, they needed to   use diesel, of all things, to generate electricity. We're   looking at upwards of $0.60 per kilowatt-hour. Meanwhile,   you're looking at some people that are   generating energy from hydro and wind in the city of   Kodiak, and you're looking at about $0.11 per hour. So a   sixth of what they're paying on the diesel side.   And that seems to be a theme. Texas, one of the   fastest-growing renewable energy-generating states in the   country, traditionally all oil and natural gas when you   think about it. Right on par with California,   which produces its own share of natural gas, but not   nearly what Texas is doing. So Alaska, Texas, seeing   that renewable energy is finally at parity or below parity   with fossil fuel electricity generation.O'Reilly:So, what am I to take away from this? Are people just   invested in this because they're like, ""Oh, we need more   electricity, so we're just going to invest in this because   of regulations""? Or is this actually being done in the   places where is economical, and that's it? How are businesses   making decisions here?Muckerman:Well, it's becoming economical in more places every   day. Even if you think, Donald Trump appointed all these   folks that are closely tied to the fossil-fuel   industry, but on his list of infrastructure   projects, he has a lot on there that supports the   renewable-energy industry --O'Reilly:You're kidding, what?Muckerman:Projects like, a lot of transmission lines so that you can   build the infrastructure for these companies, so that they   can actually get the power from a wind plant. He has this Plains   & Eastern electric transmission line project, which is   trying to move wind energy from the western tip of   Oklahoma 720 miles south to --O'Reilly:That sounds like the Pickens Plan, remember that?Muckerman:-- southeast to Memphis. And that's enough clean energy for   1 million homes in the Mid-South. So that's just one area.   That's not actually building the wind turbines, but it's   allowing that power to be efficiently distributed to places.   Obviously, if you think about Memphis' population   compared to the plains of Western Oklahoma, it's a little   bit more densely populated. So right now, those wind   turbines probably aren't being used to the   efficiency and the efficacy that they should be. But then,   you have hydroelectric plants planned, more transmission lines,   wind power, energy storage and grid   modernization targeting minimizing the magnitude of   potential blackouts in California by increasing storage for   renewable energy. All told, it says that the projects could   add about 9 gigawatts of clean power if they are all   finalized and put into place. So that's roughly about a   third of all the energy capacity that we have added in the last   year, just in a few of these projects that Trump has laid   out in his initial infrastructure plan.O'Reilly:Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I just mentioned, that   sounds a lot like the Pickens Plan. Do you remember that, in   2008, T. Boone Pickens was like, ""You have this energy   corridor from The Dakotas down to Oklahoma, you have all   this wind, you need to get it to the coast,"" and he wanted   to build these huge transmission lines? And one of the   problems is they need to be enormous, because if you're   sending electricity over long distances, you lose some of it.   It's actually very difficult. That's kind of exciting.Muckerman:Yeah. A lot of these projects are being built by private   companies, so it's very fragmented, almost on a   state-by-state basis. If you go to the SEIA website, the Solar   Energy Industry Association, they put out a report from   September 2016 that basically lists every project that's   online, being constructed, or in development in the   entire United States. The list is 30-40 pages long, because   there are just so many small companies that are out there   building one plant, two plants. Maybe eventually they will get   bought up, or maybe some of those are part of a bigger   holding corp. But it's very widely distributed. It's not   all public companies that are doing this. Generally, if you   think about the suppliers of these wind turbines and solar   panels, those are --O'Reilly:Like aGeneral Electricor something.Muckerman:Yeah, those are coming from publicly traded companies like a   General Electric, like aSiemens. Then on the solar-panel side you haveFirst SolarandSunPower, and thenSolarCityon the residential side. They're actually providing the   solar panels and doing some installation. But a lot of the   folks that are building these and operating them are private   companies, for now.O'Reilly:Awesome. So, Mr. Muckerman, it sounds like in the   United States, solar is becoming common.Muckerman:Adding jobs, adding clean energy, being supported by states   that you might not think would support clean energy, and   even Donald Trump is supporting it.O'Reilly:And it's because of economics.Muckerman:Yes. Flat-out.O'Reilly:So, solar is going in where there is sun; wind is going   where there's wind. It's cost effective.Muckerman:Yeah. I'm pretty sure they even just approved the   largest offshore wind farm in U.S. history off Long Island.   So, there's that.O'Reilly:For New York City, yeah.Muckerman:Yeah. If you look at the Northeast, they're pretty   underserved. At least, natural gas energy hits New York   and doesn't make it past New York. So the New England area   is definitely hurting for natural gas and renewable energy.O'Reilly:It was a big learning experience for me when I saw   both how needed and difficult it is to get natural gas   lines up there in the Northeast. It's like a web, and   there's not enough. It's kind of crazy.Muckerman:They're trying to build them, but not quickly.O'Reilly:It's densely populated; it's actually kind of difficult.   Really quick, before we talk about some more specifics,   like in a continent like Africa with the sunlight it   gets and everything and how, with solar, you can put up a   solar panel and power something, it's decentralized. That   will obviously see some growth, and we'll discuss that in a   minute. But I wanted to quickly go down a list. This is   enormous. There's a group called The Renewable Energy Policy   Network for the 21st Century. They, every year, put out of a   report on the global status report of renewable energy. You   can go to ren21.net and check it out. They do this every   June, so we have last June's report, and it mostly   covers 2015. But anecdotally, this sort of thing doesn't get   changed a lot. This thing is pages and pages long! All   right, let's do a quiz. Where do you think --Muckerman:Oh, I have the list right in front of me.O'Reilly:Oh, you do?Muckerman:Yeah. I can't cheat on air.O'Reilly:Shut your computer!Muckerman:I've seen it; it's too late.O'Reilly:All right, fine.Muckerman:We can quiz our listeners. Give them five seconds to guess.O'Reilly:All right, our listeners can check this out. Google   ""2016 report.""Muckerman:Sorry. I ruined it. You sent it to me.O'Reilly:I'm not going to forget this. No, I did. What stuck out to you   there? You have China beating us for investment in renewable   fuels --Muckerman:And total capacity or generation as of the end of   2015 for all renewable power. That's only set to   accelerate, I think, you're looking at China expected   to, according to Reuters, plow $361 billion into   renewable-energy power generation by 2020 -- $361 billion. That   will create 13 million jobs, they estimate. And that's just   over a five-year period from 2016 to 2020.O'Reilly:The per-capita numbers were hilarious to me. Investment in   renewable power and fuel per unit of GDP, No. 1 was   Mauritania, then Honduras, Uruguay, Morocco, and   Jamaica. Renewable power capacity per capita, No. 1 is of course   Denmark, Germany, Sweden. But, dollar for   dollar, it's pretty much us, China, Germany, a little   Japan and the U.K. in there.Muckerman:Yeah, Japan is No. 3 in terms of investment in 2015. Then   the U.K., and then India.O'Reilly:Which is not surprising, because they had the nuclear   problem, they have no natural resources, they don't   have oil, so it's like, what are we going to do here?Muckerman:Makes total sense, and they're surrounded by ocean.O'Reilly:A little tricky there. I was surprised by how big biomass   energy is. Is that the landfills, and it has methane burning   it --Muckerman:Yeah, the waste, heat, things like that.O'Reilly:I was surprised by how big that was.Muckerman:Yeah, not too shabby. A decent amount. If you think   about how much we actually do waste, it's smart to use   it.O'Reilly:Yeah. It's physics. This is just energy; it's like wind.   These things happen.Muckerman:Energy can never be created or destroyed.O'Reilly:Oh, man. That's very Zen of you.Muckerman:Isn't that something that they say in physics?O'Reilly:Yeah. All right, let's dive in here to a few   unique interesting situations. Saudi Arabia.   They obviously have a ton of sunlight, but ...Muckerman:What are they well known for, besides sunlight?O'Reilly:Oh, I don't know, maybe they're known for going out   into the desert and sticking a straw in the sand and getting   oil.Muckerman:And they are expected to dump between $30 [billion] and $50   billion into major renewable energy by 2023. So not nearly on the   same level as China, but still.O'Reilly: Well, what was the Saudi Aramco, the oil   company that might be IPO-ing in a year or two,   they're talking about dabbling in it a little bit, I   saw this morning.Muckerman:Maybe $5 billion in renewable-energy deals, yeah. They've askedHSBC, [JPMorgan Chase], andCredit Suisseto go out there and try to find some companies that they   might be able to buy with $5 billion of cash lying around.O'Reilly:What do you think Saudi Arabia is thinking? I see a   couple possibilities, or maybe it's all of them. Is   this, we need to shift away from oil because someday   we're not going to be able to use it?Muckerman:Yeah, I think the last couple years was a gut check for   them, because oil provides a pretty decent amount of   subsidies for the social programs they have. So they've been   losing out on a lot of that revenue. So they're trying to at   least internally reduce their demand on oil.O'Reilly:So they can sell more oil?Muckerman:Yeah, I think that probably has something to do with   it. Also, they powered their country with oil.O'Reilly:I was about to say, they are one of the few countries that burns   oil for their electricity grid.Muckerman:Yeah. So if they can make electricity cheaper, then why not?   They're looking to grow up to about to about 30% of their   power from low-carbon sources by 2030. Right now, they   have about 10 gigawatts of power from wind, solar, and   nuclear.O'Reilly:Sweet. I have to think they're trying to play catch-up with   the UAE, too. They've been doing a lot with solar.Muckerman:I mean, they're right there' it's the desert; they have   plenty of sun right along the equator.O'Reilly:Yeah, exactly. What else stuck out to you as you looked   around the globe? As I mentioned, I'm optimistic about   Africa because installing the transmission lines   for traditional centralized power like we have, like   a natural gas-burning power plant or something, it's a   little bit of a hassle.Muckerman:Well, if you think about it in terms of what they have   done with telephones, for example. They've pretty much   skipped land lines and went right to cellphones. So if you think   about it, it's a similar situation. You have a cell-phone   tower rather than telephone lines crisscrossing the   country. You can liken a cellphone tower to a solar   grid, because they can be placed sporadically around the   country and distributed in the regions where they're needed.   So I think that's probably what's going to happen. It's just   going to skip traditional power generation and go straight to   renewable, more regional distribution, as needed.O'Reilly:It almost seems like renewables are the best thing that ever   happened for developing nations. I mean, that's pretty   darn useful.Muckerman:Now that it's cost-effective, yeah. Beforehand, they were   just kind of waiting on it. Companies want to invest. Foreign   direct investment is a big thing in this world. I don't   know if it's going to be African companies that are building   these solar and wind and hydroelectric power   plants, but somebody is going to do it because there's money   to be made.O'Reilly:Right. So I'm an investor, you're an investor, we're all Fools,   we're all investors. How do you get in on this? What do you   see as the reasonable way to make money off these   trends?Muckerman:For me, personally, I would probably look at the bigger   providers of the equipment. Like we mentioned, a few,   GE kind of hedges your bets a little bit, because   they're involved in oil and gas, and also, they   have exposure to renewable-energy sources. So I think that   kind of hedges your bets a little bit.O'Reilly:The hardware is like, eh, what do you think about an advanced   solar-panel manufacturer, like aCanadian Solaror something?Muckerman:They have had their troubles.O'Reilly:If you can't see him, he's wincing right now.Muckerman:That's just because these companies have gone in waves. One   company makes an advancement, and everyone jumps on   their bandwagon, and then somebody else's solar-panel   cells become more efficient, so everybody jumps ship   and starts using them.O'Reilly:It's like computers.Muckerman:Yeah. So that's why I would say big holding company like GE   or Siemens to get access to wind power. Then, companies that   are effectively adding solar power at utility scale. I think   that's really where you're going to make your money. So   MidAmerican might be a good choice, or SunPower, which is a more   global company. You see SunPower installing solar panels,   and First Solar, too, all over the world. SunPower is fortunate   enough to have the backing ofTotal, which is a forward-thinking oil and gas company.O'Reilly:Right. What do they own, 30% of that thing?Muckerman:It might be more, it's at least 30%. They may have upped   their stake in the past couple years. I'm not 100% sure.O'Reilly:That wouldn't surprise me.Muckerman:Then there's another company that's hedging its bets   between traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy --   Total, a French company. There's just a few to point out.   Bu, like I said earlier, a lot of these companies are   private. You have to do some digging, but maybe you could   hold a portfolio of a few of these companies, little bits   and pieces of each, rather than betting your entire   portfolio of renewable energy on one or two companies. You can,   maybe, buy a basket of them.O'Reilly:Awesome. Yeah, the bottom line, it sounds like, is that this   trend is happening. It is becoming increasingly common in   more and more places.Muckerman:Yeah, it sure is. You think aboutTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)and SolarCity being combined with some help   from Panasonic and that lithium-battery factory. If   energy storage does happen, which, I think it would have to   from renewable-energy sources, the Tesla Gigafactory out   there in California is looking to build more batteries than   the entire capacity to build batteries worldwide is right now. So   they're expecting the need to be there.O'Reilly:Awesome.Muckerman:If you don't have renewable-energy generation, you don't need   those batteries. So they'd better pray that the trend continues,   which I expect it to.O'Reilly:Awesome. All right. Thanks for your thoughts, Mr. Muckerman.Muckerman:Well, what are you looking at? Let's get some thoughts from   you really quick before we head out. You mentioned one company?   8point3?O'Reilly:Yeah. We're short on time. Thank you for the shout-out, though.   I'm kind of conservative with this sort of thing. One, I'm   not a tech person. I don't know which solar panel is the best,   that sort of thing. But I like the monopolistic   characteristics, the cash generation characteristics of   those yieldcos that get spun out, and they just build huge solar   projects. They send the electricity into the grid. That's   it. 8point3 Energy Partners has a 7% yield, it's kind of   guaranteed. I mean, it's meat and potatoes.Muckerman:Unless the sun starts charging for its rays, then   these companies are sitting kind of pretty in the long   run.O'Reilly:Right. Cool. All right.

Nvidia Shows Artificial Intelligence Revolution Is Biggest Trend Of Our Time;2/10/2017;"Nvidia (Shutterstock photo)It's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining more than 370%. But while the company's graphics processor unit (GPU) chips are being used in everything from gaming PCs to autonomous cars to virtual reality to data centers, the reinvigoration of Nvidia is built by one thing: artificial intelligence.AI is increasingly being used in everything and everywhere, most notably data centers for machine learning, where Nvidia's GPUs have a tremendous lead over the competition, including anything from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenue was up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impressive fiscal third-quarter 2017 results that helped send the stock soaring more than 30% in November 2016.makeArticleAd();The technology is touching everything and anyone, be it on your smartphone or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or using software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang toldBarron'sthat AI is just the future of software.If you read Nvidia's conference call transcript and itsearnings press release, AI is mentioned everywhere and with good reason: deep learning is only made possible by the advancements in AI being made by university researchers and big companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.In reacting to the blow-out earnings results, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis called Nvidia essentially the only publicly traded company solely focused on AI. ""[Nvidia] posted its 7th consecutive beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% likely marks 2nd derivative peak, the 200% growth in its Datacenter business and improving GM reinforce our thesis that NVDA is emerging as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most exciting growth drivers in tech,"" Lipacis wrote, while raising his price target to $140 from $125.Of the aforementioned areas, perhaps the one that is most tangible to show consumers the AI revolution is autonomous driving.Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneered autonomous driving in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla has chosen to use Nvidia's chipsets to not only help it with its infotainment unit, but more importantly, the software that helps withautonomy, using the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform.Society is a little bit away from true autonomy in a car (Level 5), in which a human does not need to do anything, but Tesla is working on getting towards Level 4/5 faster than anyone else, thanks to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, clickhere.)Nvidia has several other automotive partnerships, including recently announced ones with Bosch andAudi.All of this highlights that self-driving cars is not just a science fiction fantasy, it's real and it's coming. And it's being powered by AI. The societal impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, but there is no stopping it.AI is continuing to become more prevalent in everything we do, but we are nowhere near general AI, in which computers can make decisions just as a human can. What we're experiencing right now is soft (weak) AI, in which humans tell a computer to do a task and it does it better than any human can. But thanks to deep/machine learning, we're getting closer to general AI, even if it's still decades away. That means the AI revolution is only just getting started and it has years and years on which to run.All thanks to Nvidia."

2 Brilliant Ways NVIDIA Corporation Is Investing in the Future;2/9/2017;"Investors followingNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) already know that the company is a clear leader in   the graphics processing unit (GPU) space as it holds more than   70% of the discrete desktop GPU market share right now.NVIDIA earns about 62% of its total revenue from sales of GPUs   in its gaming segment, but the company isn't satisfied with just   kicking up its feet and reaping the benefits of that. Instead,   NVIDIA is using its GPU knowledge to begin dominating two future   markets: self-driving technology and data centers.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Hitting the gas on self-driving technologyIt's hard to write about NVIDIA's future without talking about   semi-autonmous driving. That's because autos are a clear area of   focus for the company and because NVIDIA has already taken an   early lead.NVIDIA uses its GPUs to process images from on-board cameras   mounted on semi-autonomous cars so that the vehicles know what   they're looking at (i.e., a moving car vs. a dumpster). NVIDIA's   supercomputer, called Drive PX 2, is on its second iteration   already and is used by more than 80 automakers and Tier 1   automotive suppliers to deliver high levels of semi-autonomous   features.Teslais the latest carmaker to begin using NVIDIA's technologies for   self-driving capabilities, and there are plenty of reasons   investors should be optimistic that NVIDIA's current automotive   investments are just getting started.The company earned $127 million from its automotive segment in   fiscal Q3 2017, which was a 60% increase year over year. While   that figure isn't a lot of money for the company -- it represents   just over 6% of NVIDIA's top line in the quarter -- it's worth   mentioning that the overall driverless car market is expected to   be worth $77 billion by 2035.Tesla's commitment to its ongoing release of new   semi-autonomous driving tech, Google'snewly created Waymoself-driving car company, andBaidu's aggressive self-driving technology tests in China all point to   a coming future of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles.IHSAutomotive predicts that the world could reach driverless car   ubiquity about 30 years from now -- and NVIDIA is creating some   of the technology right now to make that a reality.Data centers risingAside from automotive tech, the other area NVIDIA is investing   its future in is data centers. This segment has been part of the   company's business for a while, but recently, NVIDIA has doubled   its efforts to expand into new data center markets -- and it's   paying off enormously.In fiscal Q3 2017, the company earned $240 million from its   data center segment, a staggering increase of 192% year over   year. When asked about the company's data center growth, CEO   Jen-Hsun Huang said NVIDIA has been creating new   opportunities in the space like virtualization, deep   learning, and computational science.Data center revenue accounted for about 12% of the company's   top line in the third quarter, but investors should keep in mind   that this segment is the company's fastest-growing business, and   it has some of the highest margins as well. NVIDIA believes its   data center addressable market is worth $5 billion, making it a   massive revenue opportunity for the company's future.Just the beginningNVIDIA had a tremendous 2016, with the company's stock price   skyrocketing 229%, and that's left investors understandably   wondering if there's more where that came from. We'll know a bit   more when the company releases its fourth-quarter 2017 results   later this week, but no matter what happens, investors should   look to NVIDIA's long-term pursuits outside of its core gaming   segment. NVIDIA's focus on automotive technologies and data   centers could be two huge growth areas in the coming years -- and   they're future opportunities investors shouldn't overlook.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why You Should (and Shouldn't) Buy NVIDIA;2/9/2017;"NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , the graphics-chip maker and leader in the   burgeoning virtual-reality and driverless-car markets, has been   on an absolute tear over the past 12 months, with shares up over   340%. At this point, it's natural for investors to wonder if it's   too late to buy a few shares -- this run could just be the   start of NVIDIA's path to world domination, or it could be the   very top of a bubble-like valuation.While the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle, there   are certain types of investors who should, and shouldn't, invest   in NVIDIA no matter what the reality is. So with this fundamental   truth in mind, we asked two of The Motley Fool's best and   brightest just who should (and shouldn't) invest in NVIDIA.   Here's what they had to say.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.You firmly believe in the growth storyChris Neiger: NVIDIA has caught the eye of many tech investors with its stock   price run-up in 2016. The investor optimism is more than just   speculation, though. NVIDIA is already a dominant force in the   GPU market, with more than 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market   share, and it shows no signs of ceding its lead to rivalAMD. That's important, because the company brings in about 62% of   its total revenue from its gaming GPU segment.If that were the only thing going for NVIDIA, it would   probably be enough. But one of the reasons this company is so   exciting is that it's taking what it knows about GPUs and   applying it to all-new growth markets -- namely, semi-autonomous   driving and high-powered, artificially intelligent   supercomputers. The company's DGX-1 computer uses deep learning   and artificial-intelligence analytics to generate as much   processing power as 250 conventional servers. Data-center revenue   is NVIDIA's second-largest business segment, and the company is   proving it can innovate like no other in the space.In the semi-autonomous-driving market, NVIDIA's Drive PX 2   supercomputer is being used as the onboard computer for many   self-driving vehicles. The computer uses NVIDIA's GPUs to   processes visual information in real time and give cars a type of   situational awareness. Eighty automakers and Tier 1 automotive   suppliers are already using NVIDIA's Drive PX system, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) just became one of NVIDA's most recent customers.   Some investors may be scared away by the company's pricey P/E   ratio of 74, but NVIDIA should continue to be a long-term growth   story as long as the company continues growing gaming revenue at   a healthy clip and its investments in AI and semi-autonomous   driving continue to pay off.Because everyone else isSean O'Reilly: NVIDIA remains the undisputed king of advanced graphics chips.   What's more, thanks to its NVIDIA Drive PX 2 computing   platform, it has a respectable stake in the future of   driverless carsandartificial intelligence. Given these catalysts, it's shouldn't   have been surprising that NVIDIA was one of the best performing   stocks of 2017. Yet that awe-inspiring performance is precisely   where the danger in investing in the company now lies.To invest in any company, not just NVIDIA, you need to believe   in that company and perform your due diligence. You need to read   conference calls, have faith in management's vision for the   future, and find the current valuation compelling, because at   some point, your faith in the company will be tested. It's not   unheard of for a stock that's rewarded shareholders with huge   gains in a short period to fall, 10%, 20%, or even 30%, only to   then rocket ever higher -- leaving those who sold in the pullback   out in the cold.NVIDIA has a fantastic suite of offerings, led by its GeForce,   PureVideo, nForce, GoForce, and Quadro chips, and a foothold   in a number of potentially huge markets. NVIDIA is exceptional at   what it does -- but they are not unassailable (yet) and it's   worth repeating that those big catalysts arepotentiallyhuge markets. Right now, the company is a non-monopolistic   business, playing in nascent tech segments, and it's priced at 40   times forward FY 2017 earnings. Even further out, the company   currently trades at 23 times FY 2020 estimates earnings, as   estimated byS&P Global Market Intelligence. If NVIDIA stumbles with quarterly results or offers up guidance   that implies the business will slow down, the stock price will   more than likely take a hit as expectations of future profits   normalize.Bottom line: Don't just buy into NVIDIA because it's the   current hot stock. Investors interested in the business need to   have the stomach for growth investing. You will be tested, and   the last thing you want to do with a great business like NVIDIA   is to sell out when Mr. Market throws a fit.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

How Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Benefits From Tillerson’s Appointment;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPolitical pundits were generally aghast when President Donald J. Trump appointed then-CEO ofExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), Rex Tillerson, to the post of Secretary of State. The prevailing wisdom that somehow this position had to be filled by someone from government, with political experience, was blown to bits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWelcome to the Trump administration, which is defining itself by blowing up the way things are ""normally done.""Since that announcement, other news have altered my theory regarding why Tillerson was named, but only cosmetically, and I believe it is very good news for XOM shareholders over the long term.Few people had likely heard of the joint venture between XOM and Russia's state-owned oil exploration and production operation,Rosneft(OTCMKTS:RNFTF). Exxon created astrategic agreementto ""establish the framework for joint oil exploration and production in Russia, the United States, and other countries,"" according to Exxon. Ten joint ventures for projects in the Russian Arctic, Black Sea and Siberia have since been set up.Of course, pushing this forward became difficult because the U.S. placed sanctions on Russia.My expectation had been that Trump would lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for some kind of agreement to partner on attacking Isis, or some cosmetic withdrawal from Crimea or Ukraine. Then, Exxon could get back to work with Rosneft. Who better to negotiate this deal with Putin that the most recent CEO of Exxon Mobil?In a shocking coincidence (yes, that's sarcasm), Putin suddenlyannouncedthat it had sold 19.5% stake in Rosneft to a mysterious Singapore investment group, allegedly a 50-50 JV between Swiss and Qatari oil firms. Yet, nobody seems to know who funded about 25% of the purchase, and why some portion of the ownership is a Cayman Islands company belonging to an unidentified owner.My working theory is that Trump is all about deals. Say what you will about Putin, but at the end of the day, politics is about deals. Putin will make deals. Not only is Tillerson a deal-maker, but he knows politics. He's been all over the world, traversing all kinds of political landscapes to make deals for his global oil company! Duh!12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenAll of these moving parts are, I believe, geared toward moving the XOM-Rosneft projects forward. I'm going to guess that something about the Russian sanctions may not apply if Russia owns less than a certain amount.After this sale, the Russian state owns about 55%. Interestingly,BP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) also ownsa 20% stakein Rosneft. About 5% is publicly traded. If Russian state ownership falls under 50%, and we see Rosneft's projects start up, we'll have our answer.I'm also willing to bet that the mysterious buyers of this recent sale are ultimately tied directly to the Russian state or Putin himself. It just looks like it isn't.Now, what does this mean for Exxon Mobil stock? It's all good. The Russian Arctic is expected to hold tons of oil, not to mention the other areas of the joint venture. One has to assume that XOM stock is going to benefit because Exxon has already deployed assets and human capital over there. It may not exactly be a matter of flipping a switch, but the projects are much farther along than trying to hunt and contract for new areas to explore.Nor does XOM have to get involved with the bad PR that would result from wanting to drill in protected areas here in the U.S.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3Thus, XOM is in the catbird seat. Russia wants the oil, also, so both countries can be less dependent on oil from the Middle East. That could also mean the countries will partner on trying to eradicate Radical Islamic terrorism.

Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 Looks Like It's Still on Track for 2017 Production;2/9/2017;"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3 production is still slated to begin   ""later this year as planned,"" the company confirmed in a   statement to the press this week. Furthermore, it said it's still   aiming to ramp up ""toward 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018.""   With Tesla's planned Model 3 launch not too far away, and with   2018 being just 10 months out, the update's timing may help ease   some concerns about Tesla's ability to stick to its ambitious   production ramp-up schedule.Tesla's car factory in Fremont, California. Image source:     author.makeArticleAd();Pausing production for upgradesTesla's update on production comes as the company plans to   pause production of its Model S and X so it can install some   updates ahead of Model 3 production, the electric-car maker   explained in its statement.Tesla will begin a brief, planned pause in production for a     week in February to prepare for Model 3 production. During this     time, we plan to add capacity to the existing paint shop so     that it is ready for Model 3, and perform general maintenance     on other factory equipment.Importantly, Tesla said it doesn't expect this to negatively   impact its planned first-quarter deliveries.We do not anticipate this brief pause to have a material     impact on our Q1 production or delivery figures, as we have     added production days to compensate.Tesla won't be starting from scratch on the tooling for its   Model 3 paint shop. The automaker said in its second-quarter   update last year that it already had some Model 3 production   equipment on the line, ""including initial capacity in our   stamping and paint centers.""Reuters: Tesla to test-build some Model 3 units this     monthShortly after news surfaced of Tesla's plans to pause   production this month to update its production and paint   capabilities, Reuterssaidon Wednesday afternoon that Tesla is planning ""to begin   test-building its Model 3 sedans on Feb. 20, according to people   familiar with the matter.""Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.The timing of some Model 3 units is about in line with what   investors should expect, given the company's internal target for   suppliers for a production start date in July.While Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company is aiming to   start Model 3 production in July, investors should realize this   specific date is only an internal target, appropriately ambitious   so that Tesla can live up to its promise to begin volume   production at some point in the second half of 2017. Musk   explained this internal deadline in Tesla's second-quarter   earnings call last year (via a Reuterstranscript):I don't expect us to be at full production on July 1. But I     have to drive all suppliers and internal efforts to that date,     knowing that some will fall short. And those that fall short     will be cut out of the picture.And if there are teams internally that fail to execute     effectively, we will reorganize those teams. But if several     thousand parts are not driven to a particular date, there is no     chance of making any point even past that date. In an ideal     world, this would be a confidential internal, July 1 would be a     confidential internal target.Given the amount of attention that Tesla receives and the     fact that there are several, if you count two or three, three     and four suppliers, there's several thousand companies     involved. It is obviously impossible to keep that confidential.     You can't.So then in order to have a consistent message, internally     knowing that that message will also reach externally, that's     where the July 1 date comes from.All Tesla has promised for Model 3's launch, production, and   deliveries in 2017 is what the company said in its third-quarter   shareholder letter: ""Gigafactory construction and Model 3   development both remain on plan to support volume Model 3   production and deliveries in the second half of 2017."" And as   Tesla pauses production for some Model 3 factory upgrades and   reportedly plans to produce some Model 3 units, which will   presumably serve as beta test versions, the company appears to be   making appropriate progress ahead of its Model 3 launch.When Tesla reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb.   22,  investors will likely get a more detailed update on   where the company stands with Model 3, as management will likely   provide a glimpse into its full-year expectations.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Ride the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE) Higher With This Trade;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThus far 2017 has been rough for energy stocks. They stumbled right out of the gate and have been trying to find their footing ever since. TheEnergy Select Sector SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLE) is now down 3.7% year-to-date, making it the worst performing sector by far.makeArticleAd();But XLE bulls shouldn't give up hope. Support looms large and the time for a rebound is nigh. Yesterday's sharp intraday reversal is catching the eye of chart watchers everywhere. The early morning descent was stopped dead in its tracks.By day's end, XLE carved out a sweet bullish hammer candle on heavy volume. Couple that with the oversold conditions for the sector and we can finally make the case for a bullish play.Of course, the strength out of the stock market at-large certainly isn't hurting either. It's unlikely that energy stocks will continue plumbing the depths if the broader market remains strong.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixThe 200-day moving average is coming in hot for XLE and is as logical a level as any for buyers to finally make a stand.Additionally, we just filled the significant gap from last November. And as any technician knows, gaps, once filled, often become support zones.How to Buy the Energy Stock DipWhile we could certainly go for the gusto by purchasing call options on energy stocks, let's instead create a higher probability play with a bull put spread.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenIf you think XLE remains above $69 for the next month, sell the March $69/$65 bull put spread for 53 cents. You will pocket the net credit if the XLE ETF sits above $69 at expiration.The max risk is limited to the distance between strikes minus the initial credit, or $3.47, and will be lost if energy stocks bite the dust taking XLE below $65.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChip firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to release its fourth-quarter and full-year results to the investment community after the bell on Thursday, Feb. 9. In full disclosure, I've been slow to warm to Nvidia's investment appeal, and in the meantime, NVDA stock has nearly tripled.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe key to the forthcoming earnings release will be growth - just like it is for any company. So far, the earnings momentum and increases in analyst projections suggest Nvidia's prospects are bright.But will NVDA stock holders have to tolerate some bumps along the way?Nvidia Earnings ExpectationsIn mylast updateon Nvidia in early December, I suggested keeping an eye on earnings trends. At that time, full-year earnings estimates (the average of the earnings all analysts covering the name expect the company to report) had jumped nearly 32% - from $1.84 to $2.42 per share. It's a key reason NVDA stock has rallied so strongly.The current full-year estimate for Nvidia earnings (according to Yahoo Finance) is $2.41 per share. It relays that 19 analysts have provided estimates. That's about flat over the past 60 days, but actually down slightly from the $2.45 projected 30 days ago.But really, this is splitting hairs. It's very likely NVDA reports a solid quarter in terms of bottom-line growth.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowAnd sales growth is projected to bestellar. Analysts expect at least a 36% annual bump to $6.84 billion. Next year, top-line growth is projected to slow to 16% for full-year sales of nearly $8 billion; 2018 profits are currently pegged at $2.71 per share.The Business Case for NVDA StockWith a current share price of $117.40, the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock sits right below 50. That's a rather lofty multiple, and it essentially means that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickly surging share price could take a similarly speedy tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia operates in some of the most exciting growth areas for semiconductors. The company is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular its graphic processing units, or GPUs. The company boasts it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. This looks accurate - a recentBarron'sarticlepegged its GPU market share at 68%. This is one of the most compelling spaces in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia's chips are an integral component in the ecosystems that are pioneering growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machine learning, and self-driving cars. These are some hugely disruptive industries that could end up revolutionizing many facets of the gaming, computing, and automotive industries.The company's gaming business is the largest operating unit and growing 30% per year on average since 2013. Its data center business (to support cloud computing) is expanding at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automotive is skyrocketing 75% annually, though from a very small initial base.In some respects, and provided you are comfortable with the lofty valuation, Nvidia is a very compelling way for broad exposure to multiple disruptive industries.NVDA adds exposure to the cloud-computing excitement that is creating a buzz at giant tech firms includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole position in the autonomous automobile charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 computing platform currently powers the Tesla auto models that already have self-driving capabilities.The CompetitionMore direct competitors includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are looking to grow in these newer markets. Both key rivals are also likely to benefit from GPUs used to power gaming systems, machine learning, and servers used for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from its dominant market share in personal computing. Its 80% market share to power personal computers and related devices has literally resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in cash flow over the past several decades. This gives it unmatched rivalry to invest in new technology and keep a leadership position over chip competitors. But computing is mature and barely expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost its way. Years of mismanagement allowed Intel to expand on its dominance and nearly put AMD out of business. But new management appears to have reinvigorated AMD, and investors are starting to believe it can also benefit from the same markets Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arecent interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni pegged semiconductor stocks as one of his favorite industries for 2017. In his words, ""we're talking about major secular disruptions in autos, consumer electronics, and gaming."" Chips that power data warehouses to serve the rise in cloud computing represent yet another market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor's best bet to gain exposure to these markets. The rub, of course, is its valuation already reflects many more years of rapid growth.AMD is an interesting turnaround play, though with its current low levels of profitability, the trading multiples are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. Its forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest taking a wait-and-see approach to Nvidia earnings. The fourth quarter is likely to impress, but given the lofty valuation, any hiccup in the expectations could result in a fair amount of share price volatility.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGo Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock For FreeReport: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

The smartphone market is maturing, and last quarter's record iPhone numbers were the first positive news in a while. For 2017, the company wants its new iPhone to make a huge splash and have people camping outside its stores waiting for one.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut no matter how cool AAPL makes the iPhone 8, would people pay $1,000 or more for one?iPhone 8 RumorsOver the past several months, rumors have been building that AAPL is going all-out with the iPhone 8. After three years of looking essentially identical - good luck telling an iPhone 6 from an iPhone 7 without actually powering it up - the iPhone 8 is going to look different.Justhowdifferent is where the rumor mill comes in.However, the money is on Apple dropping the aluminum back in favor of anall-glass design. Making the new iPhone pop even more is the expectation of an OLED display that ditches the bezels and even the Home button.A new iPhone that looks completely different from the models of the previous three years is expected to boost sales as Apple fans trade in their old phones. There also has been speculation that AAPL will take advantage of the 10th anniversary to charge a premium for the iPhone 8.But a new report suggests that could be higher than expected.Is the Market Ready for a $1,000-Plus iPhone?Fast Companyreports that AAPL isn't just looking to boost sales with the iPhone 8,it's looking to cash in on upgrade fever.The 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansCiting a source with ""knowledge of Apple's plans,""Fast Companysays the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will indeed be the all-glass design (with a stainless steel band) and OLED display. At 5.8 inches, it will be larger than the iPhone 7 Plus. It may even have a cooler name than iPhone 8: ""iPhone X"" is being thrown around.And according toFast Company'ssource,it will likely start at over $1,000.In comparison, previous iPhones have traditionally had a $649 starting price. When the Plus models were introduced, AAPL started those bigger iPhones at $749, boosting that to $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.Can Apple Pull Off Such an Expensive iPhone 8?There's no question that $1,000-plus is averyexpensive smartphone. That's basically $250 more than AAPL has ever charged.EvenSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) only hit $849 with its flagship (and doomed) Galaxy Note 7. That phablet has a great deal in common with the iPhone 8's expected features, including an oversized OLED display and wireless charging.However, Apple is undoubtedly emboldened by the success of its more expensive Plus phone in the last quarter. Despite carrying a premium (and the iPhone 7 Plus price hike), in the previous quarter, sales surged for the larger, more expensive iPhones. The iPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for40% of iPhone 7 sales worldwide- double the share of the iPhone 6 Plus.Fast Company'ssource says Apple will also offer the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in 2017. That positions the iPhone 8 - or iPhone X - as a true premium offering. Anyone who wants a new iPhone would still have the option of buying the standard offerings (which would continue to be among the best smartphones on the market).Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3But for those with deeper pockets who truly want to make a statement, then the $1,000-plus 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will be there.It's a risky strategy, but it could pay off big-time for Apple.As usual, this early in the year, speculation about AAPL's new iPhone plans is just that - speculation.

(AMD);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are headed higher this morning, as Wall Street weights its options ahead of the latest round of corporate earnings and a smattering of economic data. Among today's earnings headliners areTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR),The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), while weekly jobless claims and wholesale inventories round out the economic reports.makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.16%, withS&P 500futures rising 0.16% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.1%.On the options front, volume surged to well above average on Wednesday, driven mostly byApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call traders looking to capture roughly $3.1 billion in dividends. Overall, about 16.9 million calls and 12.7 million puts changed hands yesterday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio slipped to 0.69, though the 10-day moving average ticked higher once again to yet another three-month high at 0.71.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders, Apple call traders scrambled to get a chunk of the roughly $3.1 billion in dividends the company will be paying out on Feb. 16, to  those who were shareholders as of yesterday. Meanwhile,Gilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) retreated on mixed options volume as guidance for its hepatitis C treatment was lower than expected, andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) was bolstered by supportive comments from BMO Capital.Apple Inc. (AAPL)In a frenzy that pushed Wednesday's total overall options volume well above the daily average, Apple call traders flooded the stock with in-the-money Feb contracts. Total volume rocketed to a near-term high of more than 4.2 million contracts, with calls gobbling up 88% of the day's take.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe most popular strikes were the Feb $125 and Feb $120 calls, whereTrade-Alert.comnotes that a plethora of 12,000 and 13,500 contract blocks traded late in yesterday's session.For traders who managed to gain control of AAPL stock shares by the close last night,Apple is paying out 57 cents per share on Feb. 16- for a rough total of about $3.1 billion to all shareholders of record.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)Bright and early yesterday morning,Gilead posted a fourth-quarter profitof $2.70 per share on revenue of $3.1 billion. While both figures were down year-over-year, Gilead managed to beat Wall Street's expectations for the quarter. Guidance, however, was another matter.It seems that Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drug was considerably more effective than expected, all but curing the disease and lowering expectations for sales in 2017. Going forward, Gilead expects to sell between $7.5 billion and $9 billion worth of hep-C treatments, far below Wall Street's expectations for $12 billion.Options traders were torn on GILD stock's reaction. Volume tagged over 554,000 contracts, with calls eking out 53% of the day's take. Still, with GILD plunging more than 8.6% yesterday, the shares are now trading well below all major call accumulations in the Feb series, while the roughly 19,000 puts at the Feb $70 strike are trading nearly four-points in the money.With GILD at its lowest point since 2014, some of yesterday's call action may have been bargain hunting in a bid for an oversold bounce for the shares.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)WhenBMO Capital commented on PC and laptop salesfor January and February, it wasn't exactly the most bullish of outlooks. Sales were slightly lower than expected in January and February's outlook was similar, with the Chinese New Year affecting demand. However, BMO said that its ""outperform"" rating for AMD wouldn't be affected, and the uptick in demand following the Chinese New Year may actually help AMD.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3With the shares riding high following rumors of anIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC)licensing deal, it was all the nudge AMD bulls needed to double down on call options.

Meanwhile, most options traders have narrowed their focus to the Feb $13.50 strike, especially put traders, with about 10,000 of these bearish bets now residing at the strike.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

I only do this if I'm willing and able to own the stock at a 30% discount should it fall to me.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenSelling naked puts is not suited for everyone, of course. But I can modify the trade to better fit milder risk profiles.The alternate:Sell the BAC Jan 2018 $15/$13 credit put spread for 17 cents per contract - a potential yield of 9% on money risked. Both trades have a 90% theoretical chance of success based on today's data.Click to EnlargeI do have to recognize that technically, BAC stock is vulnerable to some downside if recent support fails and the triangle (pictured in the accompanying chart) breaks. But that also could present an opportunity, because more buyers could step in if price breaks above the triangle.In that case, I would add a bullish call position in Bank of America to capture the breakout. Otherwise, time will do the work for me on the puts sold.I am not required to hold my trades through their expiration. I can close at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot that there was any risk of it happening, but never let it be saidTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) isn't a perpetual source of news. Indeed, TSLA stock holders have something new to process nearly every single day, and the occasional weekend day to boot.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThis week was no exception, and three of this week's developments are doing most of the driving right now:Tesla is taking a big step toward Model 3 production starting as planned.Tesla wants to enter India later this year.Short sellers are increasingly betting against Tesla stock as a rather amazing rally has unfurled since the end of November.Here's a little more perspective on all three matters owners of TSLA stock may want to digest, for better or worse.Model 3 Production Beginning SoonThe details on the matter are scant to far, but on Thursday morning, Tesla announced it wouldshut down its California plant this monthto get ready to produce Model 3s, and might begin building the prototype Model 3 as early as Feb. 20. The company anticipates full-scale production beginning later this year … in July, as initially suggested by Musk.The market knew it was only a matter of time, but to see it happening can elate current and would-be owners of Tesla stock. Somehow, the goal of producing 500,000 vehicles per yer by next year doesn't seem out of reach.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe company is believed to havereceived nearly 700,000 reservations- complete with deposits - for the Model 3, which is expected to sport a sticker price of around $35,000.IndiaThe news came as a tweet on Tuesday - a response to a question to CEO Elon Musk via Twitter, actually. In less than 140 characters, Musk said hehopes to enter the Indian market by this summer.The knee-jerk response is optimism; entering new markets means more revenue potential. It's the second thought that raises questions, though. India is a poor country, per capita. The average annual income in India is $5,630. Worse, median income is $616. It's not likely many of those consumers are even thinking about buying a TSLA vehicle.There's a curious nuance with the way India's income is distributed, though.In India, the richest 1% of the country controls 58% of the nation's wealth. That's one of the world's most extreme levels of wealth disparity. And when you're talking abouta country with a population of 1.33 billion, it doesn't take a large proportion of the population to create a decent-sized pool of potential buyers.And for what it's worth, the more manufacturing Musk can do in that country rather than import vehicles into India, the better, in terms of marketability. At the same time, though its consumers still aren't as flush as they are in other parts of the world, that's changing.Manhattan Venture Partners' Santosh Rao recently opined, ""The market opportunity is too compelling to ignore. India has a growing middle class with rising disposable income. The manufacturing cost will also be relatively lower.""Short SellersTheWall Street Journal'sBen Eisen was right about one thing this week:Tesla's short-sellers are a persistent bunch.Thing is, they may be a little too persistent for their own good.The 44% gain that TSLA stock has dished out since the first day of December, amazingly enough, wasn't a short-covering one. As of mid-January,35.04 million shares of TSLA stock were held as a short position, up from the total as of the end of December, and well above the mid-November tally of 31.5 million shares. That's essentially a $9.2 billion collective bet against Tesla, according to calculations from S3 analyst Ihor Dusaniwsk.The bears aren't backing down, betting against Tesla stock as it ticks higher. The mid-January reading is almost a record-high short interest.Big mistake.This is a stock that the market still loves to love, and though it has been a love-hate relationship at times, there's been more love than hate. That hasn't changed recently. Indeed, if anything, as production of electric vehicles scales up, margins should improve. Don't forget that Teslaswung to a profit last quarter, and may well surprise again later this month. It shouldn't take much more upside in TSLA stock to flush these bears out of their short trades, augmenting any rally - the only way to close out a short trade is by buying the stock.The Smart Money: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Already InsolventBy the way, Dusaniwsk estimates that the collective short positions entered of late are have translated into unrealized losses of $2.27 billion. Those traders are apt to be getting very antsy.Bottom Line for Tesla StockTesla still has plenty of hurdles ahead. Namely, it's still spending heavily on …well, pretty much everything, and it remains to be seen if the integration with SolarCity will bear fruit.But, the potential of India is a positive for Tesla stock, as is what is ultimately an ill-advised wave of short-selling of TSLA shares. The prospect of the Model 3's production beginning soon. of course, is a show-stopper.Although a technical dip in the near-term may be in the cards, this week's news can be scored as a pair of wins in the ledger.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSchlumberger Limited (SLB) Stock Could Be a Gusher.

Surprise, Surprise: Google, Amazon, Microsoft All Donated to Trump's Inauguration;2/8/2017;"On Tuesday,Politico confirmedthat come of the biggest technology corporations in America donated to President Trump's inauguration last month, the same companies who have recently voiced opposition to the administration's controversial immigration policies.Citing federal ethics documents, as well as sources familiar with the matter,Politicoreported that AmazonAMZN, Alphabet's GoogleGOOGLdivision, and MicrosoftMSFTall donated both cash and services to the president's inauguration back in January. Microsoft, for example, contributed $250,000 in cash, in addition to the same amount in technology and other tools, on December 28 to the Presidential Inaugural Committee.Google apparently provided an unspecified cash donation and a YouTube livestream of the inauguration, while Amazon gave similar services including tech help and an undisclosed donation. FacebookFB, though giving no cash donation, did provide Instagram photo booths and a mini Oval Office for those celebrating.It's quite common for corporations to donate to inaugural committees, regardless of political party affiliation. Microsoft donated about $2 million in cash and services for President Obama's second inauguration, while BoeingBAgave $1 millionto President Trump's inaugural events despite the president's attacks on the airplane maker.Just last December, the top executives of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, as well as CiscoCSCO, IBMIBM, IntelINTC, OracleORCL, and TeslaTSLAmet with President Trump in a so-called tech summit where the group discussed the growing uncertainty over the then president-elect's economic policies and the impact on the tech industry.The meeting seemed to create a sense of peace between the president and the tech executives, especially after a bitter election season, but President Trump's recent executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States upended that concord. On Monday, over 100 tech companies, including many of the above as well as Apple (AAPL) and Twitter (TWTR),told a federal courtthat they ""oppose the president's executive order because it's bad for the country and hurts their ability to attract talent,"" notesPolitico.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Earnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt seems unlikely that from a fundamental standpoint, there will be a lot of news in thePandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) earnings report on Thursday.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPandora already announced last month that fourth-quarter results would come in ahead of guidance for both revenue and adjusted Ebitda. That disclosure sent P stock up 6%, and would seem to limit the possibility that the numbers in the Pandora earnings report will boost the stock further.That doesn't mean there will be no news coming out of Pandora earnings. The company has set itself up for a busy 2017. The replacement of Pandora One with Pandora Plus appears to have had some success in the fourth quarter. Commentary on that initiative will be closely watched on the Q4 conference call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announced a new ""Premium"" service to compete with offerings fromSpotify,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThat product should roll out shortly, potentially boosting growth in 2017. And Pandora has said it is aiming to return to Ebitda profitability in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investors in P stock should believe the company.A Busy 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actually is up about 65% over the past year, after coming close to all-time lows in early 2016. Those gains have come despite mixed performance in the business. Revenue is up 14% through the first nine months, and likely rose a similar figure in Q4. But about half the year-to-date growth came from the acquisition of TicketFly last October. Advertising revenue also increased 14% through the first three quarters - but came solely from higher pricing. Active users were actually down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscription revenue declined in the quarter as well.The user and subscription figures are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simply doesn't trust that Pandora can create consistent profits based on advertising revenue alone. That's particularly true given thehigher royalty ratesthat took effect at the beginning of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrade One to Plus - adding features like song replays - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-based model.The plan from Pandora, as detailed after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provide a more stable revenue base. Moving customers to subscription-based services both helps margins and improves retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock likely will rise. But that remains a relatively big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earnings report, then, the most important numbers likely will come from the company's guidance. That guidance will give some color as to how successful management thinks Plus has been so far - and what kind of opportunity Premium has to boost Pandora earnings this year.But the Pandora earnings conference call also seems like it might move P stock. Management will have another opportunity to detail its strategy for 2017 and beyond. The company laid out its ""three-legged stool"" strategy - Plus, Premium and Ticketfly - after the third quarter, but investors weren't terribly impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsThe issue with P stock is that there's a real fear that Pandora's model simply doesn't quite work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenced by the nearly 80 million active users. But it's not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalty rates through ad revenue alone. The company did announce layoffs ofabout 7%of its employees in a bid to improve 2017 profits. That simply raised additional concerns about Pandora stock. The most notable is: Can Pandora really compete with Apple, Spotify andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?After all, those companies have much larger businesses - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the company has burned about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarters of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is likely to be huge as well, and that's not counting depreciation or the additional $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreciate in the near term, the company needs to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidance given in the Pandora earnings report will be key. But that aside, investors also will be looking for more information on the plan going forward here.Can Pandora find a niche in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offerings from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there really a profitable business model here, or are royalty rates simply too difficult to manage?Those questions can't be answered quite yet, but investors will be looking at the Pandora earnings report closely to better assess the company's prospects. And it's likely the commentary on the future - not the past - that will determine how Pandora stock reacts to Q4 earnings.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. The author does receive royalties from Pandora.More From InvestorPlace4 Energy Stocks That Are Ticking Time Bombs3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming ReboundThe postEarnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy best results inTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) trades have come fromselling premium against extreme opinions. But in this uber-bullish market environment, I am left only wanting to go long momentum stocks like TSLA orNetflix, Inc(NASDAQ:NFLX).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, Wall Street seems to have given up looking at Tesla as a car company. The majority of traders I know perceive TSLA as a technology company centering around the battery and sun power.Although fundamentally, TSLA is a difficult stock to recommend at these levels, technically I can argue it wants to retest the all-time highs soon. Luckily, the options markets give me several ways I can enter long trades while building healthy buffer zones.TSLA Stock Trade IdeaClick to EnlargeThe Trade:Sell the TSLA Sep $200 put. This is a bullish trade priced for $11 per contract to open. The 22% buffer from current levels gives me an 80% theoretical chance of success.If TSLA falls below my strike price, I could be put the stock, so I only sell the naked put if I am willing and able to own it at that level. In that case my breakeven price would be $189 per share.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe Hedge - Optional:Sell the Sep TSLA $340 call and collect an additional $5.50 per contract. This trade has an 80% theoretical chance of success. I need TSLA stock to stay under my sold leg or be open to losses. Taking both trades would put me in a sold strangle and widen my breakeven zone to $182 vs. $357.50 per share. I am not rushing to enter the hedge at this time.Selling naked options on a high dollar stock is definitely not suited for everyone. So I can modify the trade to diffuse its risk.The Alternate:Sell the TSLA Sep $200/$195 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade for which I collect $1.20 per contract. I still need TSLA to stay above my spread to win. Yield on this trade if successful would be 25% on money risked. Theoretically, this also has an 80% theoretical chance of success.This alternate trade could be hedged by selling TSLA Sep $340/$345 credit call spread. This would potentially give me an additional 65 cents per contract thereby lowering my dollars at risk. If both sides of the alternates are successful, the sold iron condor would yield 55% on money risked.As I mentioned earlier, TSLA stock is looking technically frisky, so a very bullish play on that would be to sell the puts and buy near-the-money calls to really profit from a rally for free.Note that earnings are coming soon, and those add an extra layer of chance into the mix.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

GM's Race To Win Self-Driving Car War Provides Long-Term Opportunity;2/7/2017;"Like Tesla (TSLA), Google (GOOG,GOOGL) spinoff Waymo, Ford (F) and a host of others, General Motors (GM) is going full-force in the race to be the leader in autonomous cars.A new study shows that it's further along than previously thought, which is a good sign for investors, even if they're not happy with the company's fourth-quarter results.The California Department of Motor Vehicles released a number ofreportsearlier this month from various automakers and tech companies on what they're doing as it relates to self-driving cars and GM, long thought to be ceding the race, has vaulted its position, thanks to acquisitions and heavy spending.makeArticleAd();Cruise Automation, which GMboughtfor more than $1 billion in March 2016, is using a bunch of Chevrolet Bolt EVs to test its software and its cars out in the field. Cruise now has more than 20 vehicles licensed in California, up from just two in early 2016, when it was using a couple of Nissan Leafs.This is a bright sign for the Mary Barra-led company, as it looks to own the entire ecosystem of the next version of the automobile, instead of ceding the race to others.It's likely to keep dealing further into in this area, whether it'spartnering with Lyftor adding engineers to its self-driving car fleet in order to keep testing and building cars inDetroit.Projects like this are likely to help shareholders in the long-run, even if it impacts spending in the interim.In the fourth-quarter, GM earned $1.28 a share on $43.91 billion, ahead of estimates $1.17 a share on $41.53 billion in sales. Despite the earnings beat, investors sent shares lower on concerns of a slowdown in auto sales for 2017, as well as the potential for elevated inventory levels.It's unclear what impact, if any, self-driving cars are likely to have to vehicle volumes in the future. There may be a need for less cars, since they could be working more efficiently. Or there may be a need for a massive resurgence in sales, as costs come down and regulators incentivize manufacturers to make transportation safer.It's just a huge unknown at this point.GM has been building and manufacturing cars for over 100 years, giving it a leg up, at least in terms of the manufacturing process, over any of its Silicon Valley competitors. This is something that Barra has consistently cited as an advantage.“We have 100 years of really understanding vehicles, putting them on the road, making sure we have a safe, high-quality vehicle,” Barra told reporters at a December press conference. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are going to have a very special offering to the consumer.”The world is still a ways away fromLevel 5 autonomy(true autonomy, in which a car can drive by itself in any condition anywhere without any help from a human), so the self-driving car race is far from over.But it looks like GM, which has notoriously been secretive about its operations, is a lot further along than anyone thought. And that's something shareholders can rest easy about."

Why Tesla, Inc. Stock Soared 18% in January;2/7/2017;"What happenedIn January, shares of electric-car makerTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) extended their march higher, gaining 17.9%,   according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence. This comes on top of a 17.5% gain in December.So whatTesla stock's rise during January is likely due to a combination of Tesla   CEO Elon Musk's growing access to President Trump, the National   Highway Traffic Safety Administration's decision to exonerate   Tesla's Autopilot after an investigation of the technology, and   the company's ongoing preparation ahead of its important Model 3   launch later this year.Image source: author.makeArticleAd();In late January, Musk was not only seen meeting with the   president, but he joinedyet anotherforum of executives purposed to give the president advice on   matters. This particular council was formanufacturing policy.Further, after a thorough analysis, the National Highway   Traffic Safety Administration decided tocloseits investigation of Autopilot's performance in an fatal crash   that occurred while the technology was activated. The auto safety   organization not only concluded there were no defects, it also   said the technology is reducing crashes by about 40% -- a figure   Musk said in January he believes Tesla's recently released   second-generation Autopilot sensors can get to 90%.Finally, in January, Tesla continued to make key investments   ahead of its planned Model 3 launch later this year. In   particular, the company revealed that its Gigafactory hasdoubled in sizesince July and is on track to begin volume production of battery   cells for Model 3 in the second quarter.Now whatGoing forward, investors should keep an eye on Tesla's   timeline for its Model 3. Given the significant ramp in   production the company anticipates it will achieve with the   vehicle, the lower-cost, higher-volume electric vehicle is key to   Tesla's growth story. Tesla will likely provide some key insight   into the progress it's making on its Model 3 in the company's   upcomingFeb. 22 fourth-quarter earnings release.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cruise Off in Ford Motor Company (F) Stock for Free;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast year I had success trading ranges inFord Motor Company(NYSE:F), as is evident by this50% yielding Iron Condor. This year, Ford stock showed great promise early, and I think it's headed higher from here.makeArticleAd();Source:Sean Davis via Flickr (Modified)Since the spike of early January, F stock chopped and consolidated around a base that has served as support since 2013. Sure we had two pokes below it but those were on market-wide debacles and were quickly rejected.With a good base underneath it, F shares are headed higher. The stock is cheap enough that I could buy it, but I still favor the juice from options trades. If I guess the direction correctly, at-the-money option trades offer a much bigger yield on money risked.In addition, I have hundreds of ways to accomplish a long trade in Ford shares using options. Buying the stock ties up more money and leaves me hoping for a big move in Ford shares.F Stock Trade IdeaClick to EnlargeThe Bet:Buy F Mar 24 $12.50 call. This is a bullish trade for which I pay 40 cents per contract to open. This is my maximum risk. The faster and sooner Ford stock rallies past my strike, the fatter the profit.I could spread this trade by buying the $13.50 call and lower my entry cost. But this also limits my potential profits to the width of the spread less my cost of entry.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThere is another way with which I can lower my out-of-pocket risk. In this case, I am comfortable selling downside risk into Ford to finance today's entry.The Bank (Optional):Sell Ford Mar 24 $12 puts. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 21 cents per contract to pen. The 70% theoretical chance of success sounds aggressive, but in this case, I am willing and able to buy F stock at the strike sold.Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is due to report next. But I think that the read-through to F stock orGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) is minimal. TSLA is perceived as more of a technology trade than an auto trade.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration, and can close any options trade for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Can General Motors Company (GM) Stock FINALLY Get Some Love?;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the three months since it last reported earnings,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) stock has been rising - though not nearly as much as it deserves. Hopefully, the upside for GM stock will continue starting today after the company delivered a solid fourth-quarter earnings beat.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)On Tuesday morning, General Motors reported quarterly revenues of $43.9 billion that were well above estimates.Net income for the quarter was $1.8 billion, or $1.19 per share, hurt by the strong dollar. Moreover, for the full year, the company sold 10 million vehicles - 2.78 million of them in the fourth quarter alone. GM also said that 56,000 employees will each be getting profit-sharing worth $12,000.CEO Mary Barra previously reported thatGM delivered 195,900 cars in January, and while that was down 4.9%, the average selling price was $34,500 - a new record for the month, indicating strong demand. The company is expecting earnings growth during 2017 and has increased its stock purchase program.Since last reporting earnings, GM stock had risen 18%. But even at a Feb. 9 opening price of $37.50 per share, you're looking at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 4.2 and a dividend that yields 4.1%.I can't stress this enough: This is not normal. Not when it's ""normal"" in the current market for a yield of 3% to look appetizing, and where a P/E of 18 is considered average.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Maybe now, those ratios will change.GM Stock: The Most Unloved Equity on The Street?Ever since the 2008 crash and government bailout, General Motors stock has been treated like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.Its January sales numbers, as good as they were, still disappointed the Street, where analysts noted inventoryremains high. Analysts said they were hopeful on the numbers going into earnings, but their hopes were underwhelming. This came despite their noting that CEO Mary Barra has a habit of under-promising and over-delivering, and that her most recent statement on earnings, delivered Jan. 10, was positive.This earnings report was well-telegraphed, but no one took notice. Analysts were expecting earnings of just $1.14 per share on revenue of $42.2 billion. The whisper number was a hoped-for $1.20 per share. And the actual figure came very close to the whisper.Of the 26 analysts covering GM stock, however, slightly more than half rated it as a ""hold"" going into earnings. There was scant momentum toward a ""buy,"" though only for investors seeking income.How High Can General Motors Fly?In a world whereTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is worth $41.49 billion after delivering just76,230 cars, General Motors is said to be worth $57 billion after delivering 10 million.Yes, investors are factoring in a lot more growth potential for TSLA, but even then, this is ridiculous.GM makes money on its cars. GM is delivering a solid dividend of 38 cents per share that it covered three times with the last quarter's $1.19 per share of earnings. GM has five times more cash than Tesla, its cash flow numbers are superior and its sales of electric vehiclesare rising.In a rational investment world, a stock like GM - which has been delivering these kinds of results for five years now - should be worth at least 10 times earnings, and its board should be under pressure to raise the dividend to maintain the yield.2 Ways to Trade Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Before It ShimmiesBut this is not a rational investment world. Such a result would mean a doubling of GM shares, which rose less than 1.5% on the latest news.All this makes no sense, but it doesn't have to.GM stock appeals only to income investors. Those investors should be very happy today, knowing that their income looks secure. The rest can only marvel at how divorced from reality the stock price of General Motors has become.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

3 Earnings Reports Every Investor Should Watch;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile a whole lot of market headlines have been largely focused on trying to game the new mood in Washington, the real signal behind the noise has been coming from a lot closer to Wall Street.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockEarnings season is approaching a climax and so far a lot of trading lights are flashing green for the first time in years. With over 35% of theS&P 500companies already on the books showingaround 4.6% growthback on the table for the market as a whole, we know the broad strokes.This is great to see, especially when you consider where we were a year ago. And while I expect the rest of earnings season to be relatively calm, that doesn't mean there aren't new things the upcoming reports can tell us.In fact, three companies reporting earnings over the next few weeks should give us some good insight into economies and sectors that have struggled in the past. This is why I'm so excited for whatYum China Holdings Inc(NYSE:YUMC),Mylan N.V.(NASDAQ:MYL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) have to say about China, biotechs and the energy sector.Yum China (YUMC) EarningsYum China's results on Tuesday will shed light on what Beijing won't tell us and what the markets around the world need to know: the health of the mainland Chinese consumer, as measured by the most accurate indicator ever invented.Yum China runsmore than 7,300Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants in China - the top chains in the country - and if the number holds up sequentially, it's a pretty good sign that over 1.3 billion hungry people are still snacking as much as ever.3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush InvestorsI'm looking for $2 billion in sales and management's take on conditions on the ground. Unless you're really in the stock as anything other than a proxy on the Chinese consumer, that's the key number to watch.Mylan (MYL) EarningsMylan's earnings release on Feb. 15 is also more color than numbers. This particular company is at the center of controversy around drug pricing and healthcare regulation -remember the EpiPen?I'm looking for management to answer questions on the mood in Washington in terms of price controls and even repatriation of foreign profit. Of course if the business is booming, MYL itself could be a good buy here at barely eight times forward earnings and annualized growth north of 10%.Tesla (TSLA) EarningsTesla needs little introduction: you either love Elon Musk or you find it hard to justify paying mega-cap prices for a niche manufacturer.Nonetheless, on Feb. 22, I'm looking for hints on energy policy and uptake on the company's home solar systems. Are U.S. households still going green, or has this trend faded as conventional power sources remain cheap?And if progress toward the mass-market electric car hits any roadblocks, I expectNasdaqto feel the pain the following Thursday.Amazon.com, Inc.

How the Allure of Growth Led Solar Installers Down a Destructive Path;2/4/2017;"In business, getting the strategy and timing right can often   be a lot more important over the long term than having the best   product or technology. In solar, many companies have failed   because they took the wrong path to market or bet on the wrong   product at the wrong time.In that vein, one lesson worth looking at right now is how   some solar companies had the right long-term strategy for   residential solar, but abandoned it too early in a pursuit of   short-term growth. Below is a look at how companies likeSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) could have put themselves into dominant position   today, but are instead now at a disadvantage. And how major   players likeTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andVivintSolar(NYSE: VSLR) will fit into the market.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The shifting trends of residential solarThere's been a lot of debate over the past five years about   what the best strategy is for residential solar installers. Among   the notable questions: Is a large, national footprint valuable,   or should companies be more focused on local or regional   markets?In general, larger companies have better technology for   quoting rooftop solar system prices, and better access to self   financing (leases); smaller companies tend to have lower   installation costs, but less access to capital within their   control.There are a few moving pieces there, but this generally   allowed large installers like Tesla and Vivint Solar to grow more   quickly and gave them an incentive to get more customers signed   up for leases or power purchase agreements (PPAs). Small   installers didn't see the same growth because of loans, so   customers could buy their system weren't readily available (until   recently). This left smaller players at a disadvantage.This dynamic led to massive market share gains for major,   national installers from 2010 to 2015 as they broadened their   reach, brought down their financing costs, and lowered   installation costs. But in 2016, something changed. Loans became   easier for smaller installers to offer, giving them a chance to   leverage their lower costs. You can see below that growth shifted   quite quickly from large installers to smaller installers last   year, a trend that will likely continue.Growth of large and medium size installers in the U.S.     Source:GTM Research Q2 2016 U.S. PV Leaderboard.This creates a couple of problems for the large solar   installers. First, and most obvious, is that they won't be able   to grow as quickly. And when stock prices were sky high, it meant   they had a long way to fall. But the more important factor is   that they have set fixed costs like warehouses, trucks,   administration, sales, and installation staff that needs to be   spread across a wide base. A more limited opportunity for growth   will make it harder to pay for those overhead costs.Installers shift to better solar equipmentOn top of the shift toward smaller installers, customers are   shifting toward better solar equipment. You can see in the chart   below that mid-size and long-tail installers favor higher   efficiency and quality modules from manufacturers like SunPower,SolarWorld, andLG,in contrast to the largest installers, which are choosing   lower-cost commodity products from the likes ofTrina SolarandREC.Smaller installers are choosing higher efficiency solar     panels than their large competitors. Image source:GTM Research Module Procurement Trends in the     U.S. Residential Market.When customers are making decisions about equipment, they   generally have different preferences than what SolarCity or   Vivint Solar might pick, but with national installers, they often   don't have a choice in the matter. Some customers prefer   efficiency, some want higher quality, others want U.S.   manufacturing, but the decision matrix is different when it'syour home. And if you can leverage the trend from left to right in the   chart above it'll be good for business.What small installers need to surviveThe advantage small installers have in the solar industry is   lower costs, in large part because they don't need to have the   same capabilities as their larger peers. A small shop with two or   three installation crews isn't going to invest the capital to   build out mapping technology to price specific installations or   custom designed racking components. They're going to lean on   suppliers for many of those products.Ironically, Sunrun was once a leading technology and finance   supplier to medium and small installers around the country,   allowing them to offer lease financing and easily quote projects   on the fly -- capabilities that small shop might otherwise not   have. This strategy didn't require Sunrun to build out a risky   national infrastructure of installers. Similarly,Clean Power Finance, who eventually became financierSpruce, had a similar strategy in the solar industry. These are   valuable offerings given trends today, but that wasn't always the   case.Five years ago, Sunrun and Spruce were betting that regional   and local installers were the future of residential solar, and   today, it appears they were right. But if you looked at the   market in 2014 or 2015, it looked like the national companies   were winning out. Sunrun decided it needed to get into the   actual installation business to keep up with the SolarCitys and   Vivints of the world. They were chasing growth, not allowing the   market to come to them -- which was the biggest mistake, long   term.Following the pack comes back to bite SunrunIn 2016, the home solar power market shifted away from leases   to loans and from large, national installers toward smaller   companies, and big  residential solar stocks took a bath as   a result. Where it looked like SolarCity (now owned by Tesla) and   Vivint Solar had the right strategy, which Sunrun followed, their   leadership advantages were just a temporary phenomenon that   prevailed until more competitive market driven by small   installers emerged. Sunrun could have been a leader in today's   market, but now it's stuck with the infrastructure of Tesla or   Vivint without the benefits of a company serving small   installers.Sometimes, companies can have the right strategy but be too   early to the market. That appears to be what happened to Sunrun,   which was offering the services that small and mid-size   installers need today, but went off track chasing the growth its   competitors had by getting into the installation business.Today, national solar companies are struggling, and Sunrun is   chasing the market withhigher costs than competitorsand fewer capabilities than a company like Tesla (think energy   storage). If they'd stuck with their previous strategy of   providing technology and financing to installers rather than   trying to beat Tesla and Vivint Solar at their own games, they   could have been a great stock for 2017. Now, chasing growth is   coming back to bite them -- and the large residential solar   installers, too.10 stocks we like better than SunrunWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;2/3/2017;"We're still a few weeks away from investors getting a peek   into fourth-quarter earnings in the solar industry and what   management has to say about 2017. In the meantime, we're seeing   interesting trends in some of the industry's most important   markets and from its most visible companies. Also, it may have   escaped headlines this week, but Elon Musk andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)  have made a big bet on solar energy's   future.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Europe and China adapting to cheap solar     energyThe global solar industry is going through some very rapid   changes that investors should keep in mind. Most notable is the   shift of power over the last few years from Europe to China.   SolarPower Europe announced this week that solar installations in   Europe fell 20% from a year ago to 6.9 GW, a level Germany alone   used to surpass on a regular basis. Subsidies have largely dried   up and now solar customers are competing on cost, which isn't   terribly easy in some of Europe's less sunny countries.China, on the other hand, is booming, with around 30 GW of   solar installed in 2016, so the country is trying to find ways to   slow growth. It cut feed-in tariff rates by 19% to start this   year and is going to test a certificate program starting in July.   It's not clear exactly how the program will work except that a   MWh of renewable energy production will be worth a certificate,   which will then be compensated by the government in lieu of other   subsidies.As Europe becomes less important to the global solar industry,   China becomes more so, so getting subsidies right will be key for   both regions in the long term.SolarCity is on its way outTesla Motors officially changed its name to Tesla this week,   and the company will soon phase out the SolarCity name   altogether. SolarCity was instrumental in bringing solar to   hundreds of thousands of people, but Musk's dream of a vertically   integrated renewable energy company under one brand needs to be   under the Tesla name.The most notable upcoming change will be Tesla's marketing of   the solar roof, which will directly tie Tesla's future to solar   manufacturing and installation. If it succeeds, it will be   attributed to Tesla's great engineering and product development   machine. Musk has bet big on solar energy, and now Tesla needs to   make it a real part of its business without the SolarCity   name.TerraForm Global catching up""Better late than never"" must be the model ofTerraForm Global(NASDAQ: GLBL) at this point. This week, the company reported   second-quarter 2016 earnings, which have been delayed due to   SunEdison's bankruptcy last year.Revenue in the second quarter was $56 million, net income was   $6 million, and cash available for distribution was $43 million.   Debt on the balance sheet was $1.21 billion, offset by   unrestricted cash of $870.5 million.As TerraForm Global moves toward a potential sale, it's   important to catch up with required Securities and Exchange   Commission filings and give investors a clear picture of   operations. While I'm not very bullish on shares, it's good to   see a strong cash level that offsets some of the risk associated   with the company's debt. But given the uncertainty of TerraForm   Global's future, I'm not confident enough to buy the stock   today.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla, Inc. Earnings: Model 3 to Come Into Focus;2/3/2017;"Electric-car companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) just scheduled its fourth-quarter earnings   release. The company will post results for the fourth quarter on   Wednesday, Feb. 22, closing out a year of rapid vehicle sales   growth, and marking the first reported quarter with the   November-acquired SolarCity under its ownership.Ahead of Tesla's financial results, here's some background on   key areas to watch when the company updates investors.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();The most important question: Is the Model 3 launch on   track?For Tesla, this will be a critical year. In 2017, the company   importantly plans to launch its first mass-market vehicle: Model   3. The big question, therefore, is whether Tesla's Model 3 is   still ""on plan for volume deliveries in the second half of 2017,""   as Tesla said in its third-quarter update.To put the importance of Model 3 into context, consider that   Tesla expects Model 3 to help the company build 500,000 total   vehicles in 2018, up from Tesla's current annualized run-rate of   100,000 units. In other words, Tesla likely anticipates Model 3   production to come close to 400,000 units in 2018. Assuming the   vehicle, which has a starting price of $35,000, sells for an   average price of $43,000, this would put annualized Model 3   revenue at about $17 billion once production hits these levels.   Indeed, even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he expects Model 3 to   evolve into a $20 billion program, generating $5 billion in gross   profit for the company on a 25% gross profit margin.In Tesla's third-quarter update, the automaker said the   company had completed production line layouts for Model 3 and was   preparing to begin the installation of new body welding and final   assembly lines for the vehicle.""As refinement of the Model 3 continues, we remain on plan for   our timing, volume, vehicle capability, pricing, and margin   targets,"" Tesla said. More recently, the company also said it   expects to begin cell production for the Model 3 in the second   quarter of 2017.Big spending ahead of Model 3Increasing production from an annualized run-rate of 100,000   units to 500,000 units in 2018 is going to require some   significant step-ups in expenses and capital outlays.Tesla car factory. Image source: author.To this end, Tesla has said it expects fourth-quarter expenses   to help drive full-year non-GAAP expenses up by about 30%, with   management citing engineering, design, an expanding geographic   presence, and ""testing expenses related to Model 3 supplier   contracts"" as primary reasons for the expense growth.Further, Tesla expects capital expenditures for the quarter to   exceed $1 billion, exceeding the company's total capital   expenditures in the past three quarters combined of $759   million.Guidance: How many vehicles does Tesla expect to deliver in   2017?Finally, one notable area to watch in Tesla's fourth-quarter   update will be the company's guidance for vehicle deliveries. In   past fourth-quarter updates, Tesla usually opts to provide a   full-year outlook for its vehicle deliveries.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.It's difficult to anticipate what management expects from   vehicle deliveries in 2017. But guidance will likely represent a   very wide range given the uncertainties surrounding the timing of   a sharp ramp-up in Model 3 deliveries. However, considering Tesla   has consistently increased deliveries at about 50% annually,   investors should at least look for another year of 50% growth.   This would peg 2017 deliveries at about 114,000. Of course, if   Tesla's Model 3 production ramp-up goes as the company hopes it   will, Tesla could deliver as many as 200,000 vehicles.I'd say it's safe to expect full-year guidance for deliveries   in the range of 115,000 and 200,000 units.Model 3 will obviously be the prime item for investors to keep   an eye on when Tesla reports results. Not only is it critical to   helping Tesla establish itself as a higher-volume automotive   company, but the vehicle's timing is needed to justify big   investments Tesla is already making, including itsGigafactoryandan aggressive expansion at its car factoryin California.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to         buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

Tesla Just Proved How Valuable Energy Storage Can Be;2/3/2017;"The impact Elon Musk andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will have on the energy industry may be larger in   the power storage segment than anywhere else. Sure, his company   is a leader in electric vehicles and residential solar, but in   the worlds of automakers and solar energy more broadly, Tesla is   a very small player.Energy storage is another matter: Tesla has been more   aggressive in that space, and could take a leadership position   very quickly. And its product could very well upend the   electricity market as we know it.Image source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Energy storage saves natural gas from itselfThe future of energy can be seen in the emergency energy   storage system built in Southern California after the Aliso   Canyon natural gas storage field's massive leak late in 2015.   Because of that blowout, which released close to 100,000 metric   tons of methane into the atmosphere, operations at the facility   were curtailed, and there was a chance the region wouldn't have   enough natural gas to meet its energy needs at peak times in the   summer, leading to brownouts or blackouts.Most of the time, the issues at the facility weren't a big   deal relative to California's power supply, because there was   still enough energy overall to meet demand. But there was   the potential for a disparity during evening hours, when   people get home and turn on their lights, that demand could   exceed supply. And that was a concern for the grid operators.Their solution was to install a large array of batteries that   could store energy when it was abundant and easily deploy it to   the grid when needed.Sempra Energy's(NYSE: SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric contracted with Tesla,   Greensmith Energy, and AES Energy Storage to build 70 MW of   energy storage with 280 MWh of capacity to offset the Aliso   Canyon outage. Just six months after the request for proposal   went out, the projects were complete.Energy storage added an incredible amount of value to Southern   California's grid, and it did so in very little time. And proving   out these capabilities will allow more energy storage growth in   the future.Filling the needs of a changing power gridThe success of the three energy storage deployments in   California is a milestone that shouldn't go unnoticed. They   filled an urgent need for the grid, were rapidly deployed, and   provide functionality that will allow more integration of   renewable energy sources like wind and solar.As the cost of batteries comes down, applications beyond peak   shaving will provide more value to the grid, and the energy   storage market will continue to grow. Tesla is already pushing   the idea of home energy storage, and companies like Stem,Con Ed, andSunPowerare beginning to build virtual power plants that are a network of   batteries working together. And with battery costs down at least   70% over the past two years to around $200 to $250 per kWh,   batteries are becoming a more economic solution for challenges   the electric grid faces everyday.Building 70 MW of energy storage may not seem like an   earth-shattering project, but it's a big step forward for the   grid of the future. If regulators are impressed with how the   project works, we'll see more like it, and the energy storage   ball will get rolling faster than you might think.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Massachusetts Just Gave a Big Opening to Solar + Storage;2/3/2017;"Believe it or not, Massachusetts has emerged as a leader in   renewable energy and may be trying to advance that leadership   position to energy storage. The Massachusetts Department of   Energy Resources just announced theSolar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART)   Final Program Designreport. This is a structure to compensate small- and medium-scale   solar and potentially storage projects in the state, and it could   become a new model for states across the country.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();How Massachusetts' new solar program worksThe structure of Massachusetts' new program takes cues from   auctions around the world that have companies compete to supply   resources to the grid, which makes prices more competitive. There   will be a reverse auction that will set solar prices for blocks   of solar projects ranging up to 5 MW in size. Developers will bid   a price and once the block is filled developers will all get the   same price as the highest bid that will complete the block.On top of the price bid for solar, there will be adders for   smaller projects, low-income neighborhood development, different   installation locations, and storage. I've included the storage   adder matrix below to show an example of what an adder matrix   looks like.The adder matrix for energy storage from Massachusetts     Department of Energy. Image source: Massachusetts Department of     Energy.What makes this interesting is that it gives developers an   incentive to add storage to their projects. And given the adders   are up to 7.6 cents per kWh there will be a large economic   justification for bringing more solar into the fold.Depending on the system's pricing and success, this could   become a model for states around the country looking to add more   solar and energy storage to their energy mix. Prices and adders   may vary by location, but the general structure looks promising,   especially given the competitive nature of the reverse auction   process.Who to watch in Massachusetts energy marketWho is going to win in the Massachusetts market?Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) will likely be a big player, attempting to expand   its energy storage presence. I would also expectVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) to be a large player given its big customer base in   the state. A wildcard could beSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , which has a big presence in commercial solar and   has been adding energy storage to the mix, but could be a partner   with third-party developers through its Equinox and Helix   products.Utilities could also have their independent power producer   arms come into the market, although they may prefer just buying   projects when they're completed or working with a partner in the   development process for such small projects. What we should   expect is that when requests for proposals are due, likely this   summer, there will be a lot of interest.As investors, this is worth watching because it could signal   the market is opening up to the value of solar + storage in   future developments. When the price of the two are low enough,   they'll also be able to compete for base load contracts against   fossil fuels and reduce the need for spinning reserves (which   level out the variability of solar). And for solar companies,   that could result in an explosion in the market's potential.   Massachusetts is certainly leading the way.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Volkswagen AG (ADR) (VLKAY) Buy Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)?;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've been hard onTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). In my opinion, Tesla is a company built on one crony capitalist deal after another, loaded up on government subsidies, drunk on great PR and sporting a $40 billion valuation - which makes even less sense than the $32 billion it was worth when I wrote about TSLA stocka few weeks ago.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)But Tesla does make a whiz-bang vehicle.So as an investor, there is no way I would buy TSLA stock. I might trade it on either side, but the risk of owning the actual stock is too ridiculous to even contemplate.That's not to say, however, that Tesla stock can't maintain its valuation in a market that doesn't care about valuation.The question is whether or not, over the long term, TSLA falls in line with its true value (which is far lower), or if something happens that results in the stock vanishing off the market in an acquisition.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryWhich brings me toVolkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY).VLKAY is in a very unhappy place right now. In September 2015, it admitted that it cheated on exhaust emission tests for its vehicles to make them appear cleaner than they actually were - punching out as much as 40 times the permissible emissions. The car maker is going to spend some $22 billion in the U.S. alone to make good with owners, regulators, dealers and the states.What a mess.So as an investor, my mind thinks about how these two companies might have a synergy of some kind that would take care of their respective problems. Then aFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) pal piped up and wrote, ""VW should buy TSLA.""What a great idea! Not only that, it is actually conceivable.The first problem would be to come up with $30 billion-$40 billion in cash and/or stock to buy TSLA. For most companies, that would be pretty laughable. Yet Volkswagen is not most companies, because about a sixth of it is owned by theQatar Investment Authority, and about 13% is owned by the State of Lower Saxony.Who better to buy out a government-subsidized company that a government subsidized company? Together, these entities also control about 37% of thevoting rights. All it has to do is get another 14% of voting rights on board, from German institutional investors, private shareholders or other foreign institutions, which account for nearly 44% of holdings.This would take care of several issues. First, VLKAY would solve its terrible emissions PR crisis by folding in a ""clean"" approach to its vehicles. It can issue some claim about eventually moving all brands under its name to Tesla's electric model, or in some pairing with its own initiatives.However, with its manufacturing infrastructure, which Tesla doesn't really have in spades, it could theoretically boost the manufacturing capability of TSLA stock. Assuming actual demand for Tesla cars picks up, that demand could be met.TSLA shareholders will get far, far more than their shares are actually worth. Of course, that wouldn't happen at the moment. Shares would have to fall 25% or so before this could even be contemplated.Square Inc (SQ) Stock Is All About the Future, Not the PresentThat is more likely to happen than not considering the volatility of Tesla stock. Also, every quarterly report is like a depth charge for the stock. A good report means the charge sinks to the ocean bottom undisturbed. A bad report and it detonates, and could send the stock to the bottom of the same oceanThen Elon Musk makes a fortune and plows part of his money into SpaceX, before convincing Chinese investors - who are desperate to get their money out of the country - to buy out that company, too.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."

2 Things NVIDIA Corporation Needs to Prove in 2017;2/2/2017;"NVIDIA Corporation's(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price skyrocketed 229% in 2016 and has   left investors wondering if there's more room for the company to   grow this year.NVIDIA has built out a dominant position in the graphics   processing unit (GPU) market for desktop and laptop computers,   but investors are also looking to new growth areas like   automotive and virtual reality for NVIDIA's future.Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();This may never measure up to NVIDIA's stellar performance last   year, but there are two things that the company will need to   prove in 2017 in order to keep momentum going: continue to grow   revenues at a solid clip, and show that investments in new market   segments are paying off.Keep the revenue growth goingEvery investor likes a good earnings beat, and NVIDIA   delivered on that multiple last year. NVIDIA doesn't   necessarily need to beat estimates in order to continue   performing well in 2017, though. Investors should look instead   for the company to deliver on its quarterly guidance and grow its   core GPU gaming business.NVIDIA's management expects revenue of $2.1 billion (plus or   minus 2%) in fiscal Q4 2017, which is in line with analysts'   consensus. NVIDIA has managed to beat analysts estimates for at   least the past four quarters, and it could do the same in Q4, but   investors should be more focused on how the company performs in   thelucrative gaming segment.NVIDIA dominates the desktop GPU market, with more than 70.9%   market share right now, and it should be able to use that   position to sustainably grow revenue and earnings through   2017.NVIDIA brought in 62% of its top-line revenue from its gaming   segment in fiscal Q3 2017, marking a 35% year-over-year increase.   The company needs to prove that it can keep growing its   all-important gaming segment revenue -- overall earnings -- in   order to justify its increasingly high price-to-earnings ratio of   71 (compared to the tech industry average of around 25).Tap into new marketsWhile the company's gaming revenues are the most important for   investors to watch, NVIDIA will also need to prove that its   investments in virtual reality (VR) and the automotive market are   paying off.VR is expected to reach a market size of $70 billion by   2020 and have 171 million active users worldwide by next year.   NVIDIA's GPU market share position means it should have no   problem benefiting from this growing tech segment. But investors   will need to see the company's graphics cards earning more spots   in VR-ready computers.Additionally, NVIDIA has to prove that it can continue   expanding its automotive ambitions. Investors got excited last   year about the possibilities NVIDIA'ssemi-autonomous driving technologieswill bring, and they should expect to see more partnerships and   revenue coming from that in 2017.In fiscal Q3 2017, the company grew automotive revenue by more   than 60% year over year, and a new partnership withTeslashould help the companyexpand its positioneven further this year this year.Good times are likely still aheadNVIDIA likely has more room to grow in 2017, particularly with   the company's core gaming business chugging along so well right   now. But investors' expectations are already sky high after   NVIDIA's run-up in 2016. If the company doesn't show that it can   grow revenues at the same pace (or close to it) and continue   expanding into new segments, some investors may lose   confidence.If that happens, remember to look to NVIDIA's core gaming   business. As long as everything appears in tact there, NVIDIA   should continue to grow over the long term. The company's stock   run-up won't last forever, but that doesn't mean this company   won't be a solid long-term investment if it continues to prove it   can dominate the graphics card market and enter new markets at   the same time.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Drops 'Motors' From Its Name as It Ramps Up Energy Business;2/1/2017;"In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this   week,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) officially dropped ""Motors"" from its name, now   taking on the corporate name of simplyTesla, Inc. The change comes as the company ramps up its energy storage   business and it follows Tesla's recent acquisition of solar   company SolarCity.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();A fitting moveTesla CEO Elon Musk has previously noted he wanted to change   the company's corporate name to just Tesla, citing the company's   growing energy offerings. To this end, Tesla changed its website   from teslamotors.com to tesla.com last year, after the company   purchased the domain from its owner.Recently, Tesla has made its energy ambitions clearer than   ever. In October, Tesla unveiled its solar roof. And, in   November, Tesla officially acquired SolarCity. Meanwhile, Tesla's   energy storage business is ramping up quickly. Just this week   Tesla celebrated its recent80 megawatt-hour battery storage installationfor a California electric utility. This single installation is   more than three times Tesla's record first-quarter 25   megawatt-hours of energy storage deliveries, which management   said spanned four continents and included 2,500 of its   residential Powerwall energy storage products and nearly 100 of   its commercial Powerpacks.Tesla CEO Elon Musk shows a Tesla solar roof cell. Image     source: Tesla Motors.Furthermore, Tesla Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel told   Bloomberg this week that its energy storage business ""is growing   as fast as we can humanly scale it.""Fortifying its energy business, Tesla announced a   second-generation Powerwall and Powerpack in October with higher   energy density and slightly lower costs on a per-kilowatt-hour   basis.Looking forward, Tesla only expects its energy storage   business to grow more significant. Musk said in a Q&A with   press after a Gigafactory tour in August that he expects   ""exponential growth from here.""By removing ""Motors"" from its name, Tesla is emphasizing how   integral it expects energy storage and solar to be in the   company's mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable   energy.But Tesla is still primarily an electric-car makerOf course, it's going to take more than a name change for   Tesla to truly shift its business increasingly toward energy   products. Investors should bear in mind that Tesla still   generates the bulk of its revenue from electric vehicles. Indeed,   even after Tesla's recent acquisition of SolarCity, nearly 90% of   Tesla's revenue comes from electric vehicles -- and this likely   won't be changing anytime soon considering the company is   planning to significantly ramp up vehicle deliveries when it   brings its Model 3 to market later this year.Image source: The Motley Fool.With the help of its lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3, Tesla   is planning to increase vehicle production from an annualized   run-rate of 100,000 units today to 500,00 units in 2018.   Therefore, even exponential growth in Tesla's energy storage and   solar businesses over the next two years is unlikely to reduce   the importance of electric vehicles to Tesla's overall   results.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Model S Fails To Receive “Top Safety Pick” From IIHS;2/1/2017;"According toCNBC, just one slip-up prevented Tesla from receiving the coveted   ""Top Safety Pick"" award:For the Model S, one crash test where the electric car did     not get the highest rating of ""Good"" was the small overlap     front crash where it was given an ""Acceptable"" rating by the     IIHS.In these specific IIHS tests, test dummies sustained head   injuries when their heads hit the steering wheel. The IIHS also   had concerns about potential leg injuries.makeArticleAd();""Neither of these (potential injuries) were so high that we     would expect life threatening injuries, but they are too high     in our opinion to get ""Good"" ratings for those body regions,""     said Dave Zuby with IIHS.Tesla responded by touting its sterling safety record:""We are committed to making the world's safest cars, and     Model S has previously received a 5-star safety rating from the     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a 5-star     rating from Euro NCAP. Model S still has the lowest ever     probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA,"" said a     Tesla spokesperson.BMW's all-electric i3 crossover SUV also failed to receive the   ""Top Safety Pick"" due to concerns around another type of crash.   Tesla noted that recent production changes to the Model S   includes updates to address the IIHS issues, and ""We expect to   receive the highest possible rating in every category, making   Model S eligible for the IIHS Top Safety Pick award"" when the   newer version is tested.Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)rose $0.81 (+0.32%) inpremarket   tradingWednesday.

"Tesla: 80 Megawatt-Hour Battery Installation ""Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg""";1/31/2017;"Electric-car, battery, and solar companyTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) took a key step this week in advancing its nascent   energy storage business when it celebrated the world's largest   lithium-ion storage installation at electric utility Southern   California Edison's Mira Loma substation. But despite its   unprecedented scale, Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel   said the project is ""just the tip of the iceberg in the future of   how much storage we are going to see on the grid.""Tesla's Mira Loma substation energy storage installation.     Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Tesla's Mira Loma installationTesla's completed lithium-ion battery storage installation   boasts 80 megawatt-hours (MWh) of battery capacity and helps   Southern California Edison provide more reliable electricity for   about 15 million people. Tesla says the batteries could store   enough energy to power 2,500 homes all day, or 15,000 homes for   four hours. The energy storage installation, along with two other   similar energy storage projects for the electric utility by two   other companies, will help the utility operate a flexible grid   that delivers clean energy, said Southern California Edison CEO   Kevin Payne at a ceremony acknowledging the project's   completion.As the largest energy storage project Tesla has deployed yet,   the company's late-2016 introduced Powerpack 2 units were used   for the utility-scale system. The updated Powerpack builds on the   company's first-generation Powerpack, which was first introduced   in May 2015. The new Powerpacks, which have 200 kilowatt-hours of   capacity, have twice the energy density of the first-generation   versions. Further, the Powerpack 2 has a new, Tesla-designed and   produced inverter, which Tesla asserts is ""the lowest cost,   highest efficiency and highest power density utility-scale   inverter on the market.""While the pricing details of Tesla's Powerpack project for the   Mira Loma substation weren't made public, Bloomberg's New Energy   Finance analysts believe it's possible that Tesla flexed its   unprecedented scope of its new Gigafactory in Nevada to   ""establish new floors for pricing, forcing the industry to   follow,"" Bloomberg's Tom Randallreportedon Monday.Ramping upImportantly, this project follows Tesla's announcement in   January that the company had doubled the size of its Gigafactory   since last July to a 1.9 million-square-foot footprint and 4.9   million square feet of operational space on the building's   multiple levels. In addition, Tesla said in January the company   had begun mass producing the company's new, high-performance   cylindrical ""2170"" lithium-ion battery cells for use in its   energy storage products, with cells for its upcoming Model 3   vehicle scheduled to begin in Tesla's second quarter.Tesla Gigafactory. Image source: Tesla Motors.As the company continues to build out its Gigafactory, Tesla   is ramping up energy storage production at exponential rates, and   the economics of Tesla's Gigafactory are playing a key role in   making Tesla's value proposition compelling. Not only were all of   the products for the installation built at Tesla's Gigafactory,   but Tesla emphasized the U.S.-based production dramatically   increased the speed with which the company was able to produce   and deploy this battery storage.""That's part of how we were able to do this site in such a   fast response time, literally if we had to ship things from   overseas, that would have taken up a third a third of the   available time for the entire deployment,"" Straubel explained at   the ribbon-cutting event. Tesla's scalability and rapid   deployment will be ""key to advancing energy storage on the grid,""   Straubel said.Tesla eventually hopes an 80 MWh installation will be dwarfed   by the total levels of energy storage the company is regularly   deploying. By 2018, Tesla is planning for the Gigafactory to   support 350 gigawatt-hours of annual cell production for its   vehicles and energy storage products combined. Meanwhile, Tesla   apparently already has its work cut out for it: ""It's sort of   hard to comprehend sometimes the speed all this is going at,""   Straubel told Bloomberg. ""Our storage is growing as fast as we   can humanly scale it.""10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Investors Should Listen When General Motors Talks About Self-Driving Cars;1/29/2017;"Many investors think that autonomous vehicles (AVs), or   ""self-driving cars,"" will transform the landscape of the   traditional auto business. While I think it's premature to pick   winners and losers, it seems clear that at least some of the   winners will come from outside of the traditional auto industry   network.Some, but not all. One century-old Rust Belt giant is   increasingly confident that it will be among the winners as   self-driving technology goes mainstream -- and if you've followedGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) under CEO Mary Barra, you know that when GM talks   about technology, it's worth paying close attention.Why GM thinks it will be a self-driving leaderEarlier this month, GM President Dan Ammann explained why the   General's management team thinks GM is well-positioned to lead in   the coming era of self-driving vehicles: ""We have been very   consistent, I think, in our external messaging on autonomous   vehicles and ride-sharing and what we see the opportunity to be.   We think this could be a very, very large, addressable market, in   autonomous and ride-sharing at scale, and we believe that we have   assembled all of the pieces that we need to lead in this   area.""makeArticleAd();This slide from Ammann's presentation shows those ""pieces"" as   GM sees them.Image source: General Motors.Most tech-oriented investors probably don't think of GM as a   leader when it comes to vehicle connectivity. But most of us have   seen those OnStar buttons that GM has been installing in its   vehicles for 20 years now. Put two and two together: GM has taken   the OnStar technology and connectivity platform -- and the   lessons it has learned over the last two decades -- and is   transforming it into a comprehensive platform for the connected   vehicles of the not-very-distant future.As for GM's vehicle platform, the photo says it all.   Ammann:We believe we have the right vehicle platform for AV. We     think the only long-term sustainable path for autonomous     vehicles is fully electric. And we're obviously in a leadership     position with the Bolt. All of our AV development that's going     on is based on the Bolt platform.The all-electric Bolt is already in mass production at GM's   factory in Orion, Michigan. That factory has plenty of capacity   to ramp up, if and when demand for the little electric crossover   increases. ""Manufacturing capability"" is a big challenge for new   industry entrants, but it obviously isn't going to be an issue   for an auto-manufacturing giant like GM.A Chevy Bolt with a prototype self-driving system testing     near GM's technical center in Warren, Michigan. Image source:     General Motors.As for network, that was a key to GM's investment in   ride-hailing start-up Lyft, as Ammann explained: ""And then on the   network, we have our alliance with Lyft, that's one year old now.   And we think it's been very successful in terms of both the   short-term opportunities we've been pursuing in relation to   Express Drive, but also, obviously, the ultimate goal here of   deploying autonomous vehicles into a shared network.""But does GM really have its own self-driving technology? How   can an old Detroit company keep up with Silicon Valley? Part of   the answer is that GM bought a San Francisco-based self-driving   start-up, Cruise Automation, last year. Here's the rest, per   Ammann:So what I'd like to do now is just give you a little bit of     perspective on where we are technology-wise here. Over the last     12 months, particularly through most of 2016, there's been a     lot of hype around AVs and new business models and so on, and     all kinds of noise and perspectives out there. And frankly,     what we've been doing as a company, we've been really sort of     working. We've been working in the background. But we thought     it was time to give you a little bit of perspective on where     we're at.So any time any of us from the leadership team are out on     the west coast, we stop by to see the Cruise team and     typically, we'll take a ride and join one of the development     rides in the cars and see how the technology is evolving. And     what I'm going to show you is a video of a ride that I went     on.Amman explained that this video is from a ""regular development   ride,"" not a special ride done just for the video. It's sped up,   but it includes all 22 minutes of the ride that Ammann took, in   the back seat of this vehicle as the video was filming.""Twenty-two minutes, fully autonomous, zero driver takeovers,   zero driver intervention,"" Ammann said. ""The whole ride was   entirely controlled from the Cruise mobile app.""""So there you go. It's real,"" he said. ""From a technology   point of view, we think a ton of progress has been made. There's   still a lot of work to do, safety, integration and so on. But   this, hopefully, gives you a flavor for how quickly we think this   is moving along.""The takeaway: It's a mistake to overlook General Motors' tech   right nowHere's the takeaway as I see it for investors interested in   self-driving cars and the intersection of technology and   autos.A lot of tech-minded investors, analysts, and pundits didn't   take GM seriously when it first rolled out the concept version of   the Chevy Bolt two years ago. How could hidebound old GM hope to   compete withTesla Motorsand other Silicon Valley darlings, they asked.Fast-forward to today: The Bolt is shipping, and real-world   testing has shown that it exceeds the targets GM announced when   it showed that concept Bolt in early 2015.That's one of many areas in which GM has delivered on   expectations set by Barra, Ammann, and the other members of the   General's management team over the last few years. That's why I   think it will turn out to be a big mistake to look past GM when   talking about self-driving cars.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Neither Autopilot nor the   driver noticed the trailer because of its white color against a   sunny sky, resulting in the first recorded death resulting in   part from a driverless-car technology failure.While this tragic crash has rightly attracted the attention of   regulators, investors, and concerned citizens, it's important to   put this occurrence into perspective. Every year, 35,000 drivers   and passengers die on America's roads -- that's equivalent to one   death every 15 minutes, and 94% of those are caused by human   error. Given driverless cars' overall track record, the safety   comparison between human- and computer-driven cars clearly points   to an automation advantage.These sorts of empirical analyses are important for investors   and can be even more essential when alarming news (such as a car   crash) emerges that might cause a short-term stock price swing.   On the first trading day after news of the crash was announced,   Tesla Motors stock dropped 4%, but it bounced back up for a 2%   overall increase by the end of the day. Steady investors can   ignore the swings and focus on statistics instead.2. Not all self-driving cars are created equalImage source: Getty Images.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has defined   a five-level continuum to determine how self-driving a car really   is. At Level 0, the human driver does everything. At Level 4, the   human does nothing. Self-driving-car stocks have taken different   approaches to deciding just how driverless they want their cars   to be, but most have come to the conclusion that semi-driverless   cars can actually be the most dangerous. That's because between   level 0 and 4, humans might have to take over when something goes   wrong -- and humans are generally terrible at reacting quickly   and safely. That's why companies that aren't innovating beyond   assisted automation may soon be left behind.Those that are going for full automation, such asFord,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Volvo, may be the ones that   ultimately become market leaders, even if their technology isn't   currently widespread. In this case, investors should make sure to   not err on the side of picking semi-driverless models over   autonomous prototypes. For example, Alphabet's stand-alone   company Waymo, which doesn't have a steering wheel and is still   considered by most to be a prototype, may actually be a better   investment than ""proven"" lane-departure warning systems, readily   available on almost all high-end vehicles.3. Self-driving-car companies want to be     regulated.Image source: Getty Images.Companies are often at odds with regulators, spending billions   of dollars on lobbying to ensure politicians steer clear of   market meddling. Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars are   taking an opposite approach. Last April, they established the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets"" to ""work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize   the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" Last   month, the group's legal counsel penned an op-ed inThe Hillcalling for a ""single national framework"" to align the country's   regulation and cut down on conflicting local laws and regulations   that could bring driverless-car innovation to a standstill. For   an industry as emerging as driverless cars, this serves as a   smart reminder that investors shouldn't consider regulation to be   evil -- rules are important and can enable the most innovative   companies to push ahead with production.The road aheadSelf-driving-car stocks are hot, and in 2017 they may attract   more attention than ever before. Investors who know the facts and   stick with the stats are likely to come out ahead, so be sure to   keep these three points in mind when making your next   self-driving-car stock pick.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Car Models That Could Get the Ax This Year;1/29/2017;"Which car models are likely to get the ax over the next year   or so?Sometimes, when an automaker plans to discontinue a model, the   company makes it obvious by announcing it -- or by dropping a   strong hint: ""We're closing the factory that makes it."" But other   times, it takes some analysis to figure out which of today's car   models are fated to go the way of the Edsel and Oldsmobile.Here are three models our car-minded Foolish specialists think   will disappear in the next year or so.makeArticleAd();The little car that couldn'tDaniel Miller(Chevrolet Sonic):One vehicle that could be on the chopping block sooner rather   than later isGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Sonic. It's nothing against the Sonic   itself, per se, but the fact is, demand for smaller vehicles is   plummeting while both demand for larger vehicles and a push   toward electrified vehicles are accelerating.The little Chevy Sonic could be cut to make room for new     electric cars. Image source: General Motors.Sales of the Chevy Sonic were down nearly 15% in 2016, and it   remains one of the brand's lowest-volume vehicles. Furthermore,   2016 was the vehicle's worst full year of sales, with only 55,255   vehicles sold; that's down from its 93,518 peak in 2014 and far   below the mid-80,000s sold in 2012 and 2013, its first two full   years on the market.Not only that, but as automakers continue to push toward   electrified lineups, it's worth noting that the Sonic is produced   at the Orion Assembly plant that recently received a $160 million   investment to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV -- and one could   assume that the plant could be the future production location of   GM's next EV project.The Sonic's segment is falling out of favor with the U.S.   consumer, and thanks to President Donald Trump's tweet flurry,   it's less likely that production will be salvaged with a move to   Mexico. That means the Sonic is likely on the chopping block   after only its first model, and its production capacity could be   replaced by a forward-thinking electric vehicle to be produced   alongside the Bolt.The electric car that got left behindTravis Hoium(Nissan LEAF):I'll take the angle of models thatshouldget the ax in 2017. And my pick is theNissan(NASDAQOTH: NSANY) LEAF.One of the very clear trends taking place in the EV industry   is a move toward long-range full-electric vehicles or plug-in   hybrid drivetrains. According toInsideEVs,Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA)  Model S and Model X are No. 1 and No. 3 in   the category in sales in the U.S., with GM's plug-in hybrid Chevy   Volt taking the No. 2 spot.Sales of Nissan's LEAF have fallen as competitors have     introduced more advanced electric models. Image source: Nissan     Motor Co., Ltd.Falling behind is the Nissan LEAF, which sold 14,006 units in   2016, down from 17,269 in 2015 and 30,200 in 2014. Put another   way, EV sales were up 30% between 2014 and 2016, and Nissan LEAF   sales fell 54% over the same time frame. What Nissan is offering   is not what the market is buying.Nissan knows it needs to increase range beyond the 107 miles   the LEAF can currently travel on a charge. But industry reports   have the unconfirmed base 2018 Nissan LEAF packing just 120 miles   of range, and upgrades only pushing it to about 200 miles. With   Tesla's vehicles already pushing a high-end range of over 300   miles, the LEAF is looking ancient. Add in the fact that the   Chevy Bolt is in dealerships and has a 238-mile range, and that   Tesla's Model 3 is expected mid-year with over 200 miles of   range, and the competition is running laps around Nissan.Nissan was one of the earliest movers in EVs, but the company   hasn't adapted to the market's desire for more range. And I'm   afraid the LEAF is permanently branded as a low-range, uninspired   EV that needs to be scrapped to make room for a well-thought-out   EV that can compete with the next generation of competitors.An iconic car that Americans no longer seem to wantJohn Rosevear(Ford Taurus):It was once the best-selling car in America. Its nameplate   was famously revived by Alan Mulally in one of his first acts   after becoming CEO in 2006. But here in 2017, it looks likeFord Motor Company's(NYSE: F) once-iconic Taurus is on its last legs -- at least in   the United States.Today's Taurus is different from the Tauruses (Tauri?) that   were the best-sellers back in the 1990s, and it's different in   ways that have hit it especially hard as buyer preferences haveswung away from sedansand toward crossover SUVs. For one thing, the current Taurus is   considered a full-size sedan, not midsize, like its predecessors.   Ford's midsize Fusion is still a strong seller, but sales of the   Taurus, like those of most of its full-size rivals, have slumped   in a big way. Ford sold just 34,626 Tauruses in the U.S. last   year, down over 11%. (By contrast, it sold 265,840 Fusions.)Once America's best-selling car, the Ford Taurus now appears     headed for retirement. Image source: Ford Motor Company.It's not just about the slumping market segment, though. The   design of the current Taurus has some drawbacks. Notably, its   back seat is more cramped than you'd expect in a car of its size.   That wasn't considered a big deal when it was all-new way back in   2010, but it's a big deal now that cushy back seats have become   an important selling point for big (and midsize) sedans. (That   back seat, by the way, is a big reason Ford has struggled to sell   the Taurus as a police car: Cops say that getting handcuffed   suspects into the back seat can be awkward, especially if the   arrestee is struggling.)Ford could fix those drawbacks with an all-new Taurus. In   fact, it did: Fordlaunched an all-new Taurus for 2016that shares its architecture with the new Lincoln   Continental. But Ford is only building it in China, where large   sedans are still popular. There are apparently no plans to start   building it for the U.S. market.The all-new Taurus that Ford builds and sells in China.     Image source: Ford Motor Company.It'spossibleFord could import some examples of the Chinese-made Taurus   to replace the current model for those customers who still want a   big Ford sedan. But I don't think it's likely: I suspect the Ford   Taurus will be gone from the U.S. for good (or at least for a   while) in a year, maybe less.

The Biggest Investment Opportunity Of Our Lifetime;1/28/2017;"Every hour of every day, enough solar energy reaches earth to   replace all energy consumed in a year combined. Every drop of   oil, every piece of coal, and every cubic foot of natural gas;   trillions of dollars of economic value hits the earth every   hour.If we could capture just a small percentage, a measly 0.03% of   the solar energy hitting the world each year, we could be using   clean, home-grown energy, not only in the U.S., but around the   world. And the companies that can exploit this resource have the   chance to upend a multi-trillion dollar industry, something so   revolutionary it may only happen once every few generations. And   it creates the biggest investment opportunity I think we'll see   in any of our lifetimes.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The power of solar energyIt's hard to state just how big the potential for renewable   energy -- and solar energy in particular -- is around the world.   And if the political will is there it would be easy to make an   incredibly large impact on the energy industry over the next   decade. Today, wind and solar power are both cheaper than   electricity from new fossil fuel plants, and there's an abundance   of land in little-utilized locations like deserts, open fields,   and oceans where renewable power could be generated. For the   solar industry, energy production can even be put on rooftops   that are otherwise un-utilized around the world.We're already seeing how cost effective solar energy is in   countries around the world.TeslaMotors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) solar division SolarCity is built on selling   rooftop solar as a cost savings tool for customers.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) are bidding on energy contracts around the world   that compete directly with fossil fuels. And with bids now below   4 cents per kWh, they're winning over traditional energy   sources.From a cost basis, solar energy is now competitive, that much   is clear. And solar energy is such a small percentage of energy   production, providing 1% of electricity demand in 2016, that it   has a lot of growth ahead.A multi-trillion dollar opportunityI think it's important to dive into the numbers a little bit   to show just how big the opportunity is for solar energy, so this   next section may get a little weedsy.The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that   global energy consumption will pass 600 quadrillion BTUs before   2020, or in electricity terms 175.8 billion MWh.To show the upside potential for solar energy, let's look at   how much solar power production there would have to be to meet   100% of the energy market's demands. If a solar power plant can   generate its full nameplate capacity 25% of the time, known as   the capacity factor, there would need to be 80,274 GW of solar   power production installed around the world.In 2016, global solar installations were around 70 GW, and   cumulative installations globally are now about 300 GW installed,   a tiny fraction of energy consumption worldwide.To illustrate the potential solar power could have, if we   assume we want to get all of our energy from solar and a solar   power plant lasts 30 years, you would have to install 2,676 GW   every year to transition the world to solar energy. To accomplish   this, the global solar industry would have to grow 35x from its   size in 2016. Put another way, the solar industry could grow   installations 30% every single year and it would still take   nearly 14 years to reach a rate of 2,676 GW per year. And that   figure doesn't even assume any growth.By 2040, the IEA predicts annual energy consumption will be   815 quadrillion BTUs. To fill that gap between 815 quadrillion   BTUs and the 600 quadrillion BTU figure I used to calculate the   figures above a total of 28,800 GW of solar energy would need to   be installed, or about 410x what was installed in 2016.It may sound absurd that solar energy could provide all of our   energy needs, but it may not be all that crazy. Nearly half of   the world's energy consumption is electricity, and the major use   of oil -- transportation -- is starting to be disrupted by   electric vehicles.Cheap and abundant solar could provide a greater percentage of   energy needs as the world electrifies and transitions away from   fossil fuels. The opportunity for solar is worth trillions of   dollars, a huge chance for the companies who grab any significant   part of the market.Why solar profits will go up as the industry growsI've laid out how incredibly big the solar industry's   potential is, but right now it may be hard to draw a line from   the hyper competitive industry we see today to a profitable   growth industry. But this is where the dynamics are changing.Solar energy bids have long struggled to be competitive with   fossil fuels and companies have had to fight each other to win   contracts. Combine that with rapid cost reduction and you have   manufacturers and developers killing each other just to gain   market share.But we're getting to the point where solar energy is starting   to compete with existing energy sources, opening up bigger   markets without the same price competition. And as solar energy   passes coal, nuclear, and natural gas on the cost curve it   doesn't have to lower bid prices as quickly to maintain   competitive. This should allow developers and manufacturers to   slowly expand margins as they cut costs.When you add in new innovations like short and long-term   energy storage and it's possible that solar power plants will be   built to provide a base load source of electricity to the grid,   something that's only been dreamed about in the renewable   industry until recently.Why the investing opportunity is so bigHopefully, it's easy to see why the growth opportunity is   enormous, both from a volume of installation perspective and also   from a dollar perspective. As solar energy beats the cost of   coal, natural gas, and oil as an energy source, it would make   sense that the profits and value of solar companies would go up.   But the market hasn't displayed that potential yet.The chart below shows the market caps of three of the largest   solar companies in the world, First Solar,Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) , and SunPower, compared toExxonMobilandRoyal Dutch Shell. You can see the oil giants are worth over 100x more than the   solar companies.FSLR Market Capdata byYChartsIf we ballpark solar energy from a revenue perspective, the   opportunity is equally impressive. Bloomberg New Energy Finance   estimated that $287 billion was invested in all of clean energy   in 2016, including wind, solar, hydro, and other sources. If the   2,676 GW investment figure I outlined above ends up being true   and solar installations costs are $0.80 per watt (about a 30%   reduction from today) the total value of installations alone   would be about $2.1 trillion.It's impossible to predict how much solar stocks will rise   over the next few decades, but the opportunity for the industry   is easily in the trillions of dollars annually. I think it's   clear that solar energy is the biggest investment opportunity of   our lifetimes. Bigger than computers, bigger than the internet,   solar energy could change the world forever. And the companies   that can take a significant amount of market share could become   the new energy giants, replacing the oil giants we know   today.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Net Metering Is Under Attack: Here's What You Need to Know;1/28/2017;"Utilities across the country are trying to find ways to   undermine rooftop solar, and some states are giving them some   help. This month alone, Wyoming'slegislature introduced a billthat would effectively ban both wind and solar in the state,   including rooftop solar. Indiana's legislature is alsoconsidering a billthat would force rooftop solar owners to sell all of their energy   production to the utility while buying all of their energy from   the utility.It's not yet clear whether either bill will go forward, but   it's clear that utilities and some states are moving to a more   adversarial stance with solar energy. And since state-wide   policies that pass tend to used as models for implementation in   other states, continued regulation of solar could be in the   offing. That could impact solar companies in a dramatic way.Solar panels. Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The rooftop solar industry is under attackNet metering has long been the foundation of rooftop solar   economics in the U.S. A customer with solar could put solar   panels on their roof and use any electricity they could, but any   excess would be sent to the grid. When their monthly bill   arrived, they would only pay for their net electricity usage,   meaning solar energy exported to the grid would effectively be   paid the retail rate. Many utilities argue that net metering   doesn't compensate them fairly for running the grid, but rules to   adopt a fairer structure aren't usually as draconian as banning   rooftop solar altogether.The three companies that would be the most at risk in the   attack on rooftop solar will beTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) . Tesla isn't 100% reliant on rooftop solar after   it bought SolarCity, but Vivint Solar and Sunrun are. If these   attacks are successful, they could be in trouble.Rooftop solar demand was already fairly weak in 2016, leading   to all rooftop solar companies to cut back on installation growth   projections. At this point, it's unlikely there will be much   installation growth at all in late 2016 and early 2017. That's   why any pressure on demand will be a negative, even if it starts   in states like Indiana and Wyoming, which have very little   solar.Why utilities will fail at undermining solarWhat's interesting about the attack on solar is that it'll   only delay the inevitable. Rooftop solar energy is now cost   effective in most of the country if net metering is in place,   which is why utilities are trying to add fees or undercut net   metering rates. But as fees, like demand charges or fixed   charges, go up, it will drive customers to solar + storage, which   utilities can't control as easily.As the cost of solar and batteries comes down, it will   eventually be economical to generate electricity on your rooftop,   store any excess created during the day, and then use stored   energy at night. This wouldn't require any energy exports to the   grid, meaning the utility would have few methods for punishing   customers who choose to go solar. If they did, customers may   eventually find it economical to cut the grid altogether.Tesla is clearly leading the way into solar + storage with the   Powerwall, an energy storage system with an inverter included.   But Sunrun and Vivint Solar are starting to add their own solar +   storage offerings as well. Call it insurance for the inevitable   attack they'll face from utilities afraid of losing their   customers. The attack may be reaching a fevered pitch and   investors will want to watch the developments in test states like   Indiana and Wyoming closely.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors, Inc. CEO Joins President Trump's Manufacturing Council;1/27/2017;"On Friday, the White House announced thatTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, along with some other executives   from major U.S. companies likeFord,General Electric, andLockheedMartin, will join President Trump's new council to meet regularly for   advising the president on manufacturing policy,reportsCNBC. Musk's appointment to the council further strengthens ties   the electric-car maker CEO has been forming with the new   president in recent months.Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Why it's notableFriday's announcement of Musk's appointment to the new council   further reinforces how the president is giving Musk his   ear. One of the first instances when Musk was given access   to the president was in December, when he was invited, along with   other major tech executives, to Trump Tower in New York City to   Trump'sTech Summit. After attending the meeting, Musk was also reportedly scheduled   for a private meeting with Trump andAppleCEO Tim Cook.Also in December, Musk was appointed to Trump's Strategic and   Policy forum, which, according to a press release, includes ""some   of America's most highly respected and successful business   leaders"" who ""will be called upon to meet with the President   frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as   the President implements his economic agenda.""The access the president is giving Musk is notable,   particularly since many of the other executives appointed to   these councils represent much larger companies, many of which   have market capitalizations of over $100 billion. Indeed, of the   executives at Trump's Tech Summit, every company represented had   a market capitalization of $150 billion or greater. Tesla's   market capitalization is $40 billion.In another display of a strengthening relationship with the   president, Musk, this week, also surprisingly said he believed   formerExxonMobilCEO Rex Tillerson ""has the potential to be an excellent Sec of   State."" Considering Tillerson's obvious ties to the oil   industry, which could potentially clash with Musk's hopes for a   revenue-neutral carbon tax, Musk's support for Tillerson speaks   to his willingness to be open to the Trump Administration's ideas   and strategies.Can Tesla benefit?For Tesla investors, the question is whether all this will   actually benefit the company. With Tesla being in the business of   selling electric cars, energy storage solutions, and solar   panels, the company's mission is tied directly to preventing   climate change, something Trump and Musk haven't seen eye-to-eye   on. But these new ties may be mitigating some investor fears of   sudden political action that could hinder Tesla's businesses.   However, it will be the Trump administration's actions -- and not   its relationship with Musk -- that will matter in the end.TSLAdata byYCharts.Meanwhile, investors seem to at least be giving some weight to   Musk's growing ties to the president. The stock has surged about   38% as Trump increasingly gives Musk his ear.The area in which Tesla looks positioned to benefit most from   the Trump Administration has less to do with the electric-car   maker's sustainable energy agenda and more to do with Tesla's   significant emphasis on U.S. manufacturing. Excluding   contractors, Tesla has created over 13,000 jobs in the U.S., most   of which are manufacturing related. And the company's   2016-acquired SolarCity has created about 12,000 U.S. jobs.Further, Tesla says its under-construction Gigafactory will   employ about 10,000 people at peak production and indirectly   create about 20,000 to 30,000 additional jobs in surrounding   regions. Tesla's growing U.S. manufacturing presence is directly   aligned with one of the president's top priorities to create more   domestic manufacturing jobs.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

The answer to that question is critical for investors.GE Stock Is Exciting, and That's Bad!GE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons.Click to EnlargeWhile it's very early into the new year, nevertheless, it's worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA.I don't think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%.More worryingly, traders haven't pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results.Rightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there's a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year - and we've basically burned through two-thirds of that profit.I don't care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it's a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?Just Stay the Course With General ElectricSo should potential buyers heed the warning? Absolutely, they should! GE stock has formed an ""inside day"" pattern against the losses incurred by the feeble earnings report. Unless shares can quickly fill the technical gap, momentum definitely leans bearishly. Attempting to catch a falling knife here would not be the greatest idea.Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants InThat said, the month of January is GE stock'skryptonite. The last three Januarys produced a shockingly bad loss of 6%. Since 1962, General Electric has averaged only 0.8% returns for the opening month of the calendar. In nominal terms, there were only 28 positive Januarys over that time frame. That means that GE stock is as useful as a coin toss during the NFL playoffs.However, the industrial titan is a consistent winner over the long run. By the end of the year, GE stock is good for an average 13% return. Nominally, 39 years ended sunny side up. This current decade has been particularly robust, averaging over 15%.I've made this argument before, but it really comes down to your end goal. If you're looking for a hot growth stock, look elsewhere, please! If you want to bide your time and not rock your portfolio with risk, GE stock is a prudent choice.But even reliable names have their off seasons. Watch General Electric closely, and wait for a baseline of technical support before going in too rich.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 20177 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThe postWhy General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has a History of Winningappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla's decision to cancel the order prompted speculation elsewhere in the German media that it may be giving into to pressure from the new U.S. administration and President Donald Trump threatening large border fees for goods produced outside the U.S. and then returned for sale, the news outlet said.SHW said it disagreed with Tesla's reasons for cancelling the order, adding it reserves the right to seek damages. It was unclear if they have yet done so, Electrek said.TSLA shares were down about 0.7% at $252.80 each, returning within 50 cents of its break-even mark late today before drifting lower again just before the closing bell.

New Social Tool for Fitbit Inc (FIT) App Doesn’t Solve the Problem;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsKudos toFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) for taking action - any action - as a means of rekindling a quickly-deteriorating business and quelling the free fall FIT stock appears unable to escape. Far too many companies would simply opt to do more of the same, unwilling to admit the organization's wheels were falling off.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitOn the other hand, not all actions are effective, and the one Fitbit is now taking seems more than a little bit impotent. That is, the mission to develop an online ""community"" of Fitbit users sounds great on the surface, but is a bit presumptuous. Is a wrist-worn activity tracker really the foundation for Internet-based friendships?When all is said and done, Fitbit is still unraveling simply because the devices don't compel enough consumers. The implosion of FIT is merely a reflection of that increasingly-harsh reality.Losing InterestAll-things-tech website Digital Trends may have described it best, calling Fitbit's new social experience a""mini-Facebook for your fitness tracker.""Members can share stories, get tips from experts, and communicate with other members about their related journey toward a healthier lifestyle. Usersinterface with the device's smartphone app to enjoy the enhanced experience.It's a clever step forward, to be sure. It can't induce newcomers into making a purchase, though, as not owning a Fitbit device precludes a potential member from joining such a group.The new app also may, or may not, radically change the even bigger headwind for Fitbit and FIT stock. That is, far too many people stop using them shortly after acquiring them.2 Trades to Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) StockTake any numerical estimate with a grain of salt. On the other hand, when several estimates all, more or less, say the same thing, there's likely something to it. And, the dire numbers for Fitbit are15% of users abandon their fitness tracker after 30 days of use, and 42% of users stop using the device after six months. In time, half shelf them for good.That's a pretty steep drop-off rate for a technology that most owners, at one point, considered a must-have. Where it really hurts, though, is the word-of-mouth advertising front, where most sales are ultimately made. If current owners aren't jazzed about their device, they're certainly not going to encourage others to buy one.The addition of a social component to the app isn't likely to make Fitbit devices any stickier or more marketable, particularly now thatconsumers are starting to experience social media fatigue.The really curious, telling part about the high abandon rate? After quitting, former users eitherfound no difference in how they live their lives, or were glad to have one less thing to manage online. Fitbit wearables were supposed to address both of those matters.Red Flags All AroundIt's not as if we haven't seen empirical evidence of the slowing interest - and even a growing disinterest - in Fitbit devices.One piece of evidence is the disappointing Q4 revenue outlook. At one point expected to drive $985 million worth of business for the period ending in January, Fitbit cautioned FIT stock holders in November that it only expected togenerate $725 million-$750 million in revenueduring the all-important holiday quarter. The outlook is barely above the year-ago tally and would extend a developing trend of ever-weakening results.Underscoring that weakness was another report from Cleveland Research, suggesting Fitbit's manufacturersaltogether halted production in the middle of Decemberas inventory started to unexpectedly pile up. Pacific Crest chimed in mid-December as well, saying its channel checks indicated18 days worth of inventory were sitting on shelves, rather than a healthier 5-10 days of inventory. In the meantime, Wedbush Securities analyst Nick McKay opined that, in the shadow of lackluster demand,Fitbit has cancelled some new products planned for 2017.It's a problem simply because older and current products aren't driving growth.Bottom Line for FIT StockPutting all the pieces of the puzzle together, the picture is one of weakness and limited future. Now, we can see it was only a fad, even if a very curious one for a while.3 Breakout-Ready Blue-Chip StocksThat's not to say Fitbit is toast and that the market for fitness trackers is going to completely evaporate. It is to say, however, the market was never as big as touted and upgrades were significantly overestimated. The roll-out of a community-based feature of the app will appeal to a few consumers, but as has been the case to date, for most users it will be just one more thing they don't have time to mess with… and that assumes they're even interested enough to keep wearing their Fitbit.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Bullish Stock Charts That Scream ""Buy Me!""7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio Around10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaThe postNew Social Tool for Fitbit Inc (FIT) App Doesn't Solve the Problemappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Reasons to Buy Ford Motor Company (F) Stock on This Dip;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor the past five years,Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F) has been stuck in neutral, with the price movement of Ford stock coming in right around zero. That compares horribly to a 55% price gain for rivalGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) during the same period, and a nearly 80% run for theS&P 500.makeArticleAd();Today didn't help, as Ford earnings that came in merely in line with estimates had Wall Street selling off F stock by about 3%.Ford is a well-run company with a tremendous brand. But the competitive environment has been intense, and worries about slowing growth in the global economy abound.Furthermore, Ford stock has been weighed down with political risk. The company has been the target of Donald Trump's powerfulTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) account. Although, Ford is trying to manage this, including ditching a plant planned for Mexico.Is a contrarian play brewing after this latest earnings dip? Is Ford stock finally at a level where a rebound seems likely? Well, let's consider three factors:Ford's Strong Core BusinessFord simply builds vehicles that people want. But no doubt, the key has been the company's leadership in the truck market. Consider that last year, Ford sold more than 820,000 F-Series vehicles - or about one every39 seconds!10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017F is continuing to build on this franchise, too, not letting success get in the way of innovation. The new F-150 has two new engines (one's diesel), a 10-speed transmission and Wi-Fi hotspot.Ford also has gotten traction with its utility vehicles, and the company has ambitious plans to expand by five new models by 2020. This will include an aluminum Expedition and Navigator, as well as a new Bronco.While Ford's earnings were merely in line with estimates, adjusted net income was up year-over-year, as were revenues of $38.7 billion, which beat Wall Street's expectations.Focus on Next-Gen TechnologiesThe auto industry is in the midst of a technological revolution, as seen with the emergence of self-driving cars. Of course, several mega-tech operators, likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), have been making moves into the industry.Ford doesn't want to be left behind, and has responded in several ways, including investing heavily in developing electric vehicles. The goal is to launch 13 by 2020, including an F-150 and Mustang hybrid. Ford is also laying out its own charging network.Ford also has been working on making their cars more connected. An interesting example of this is a deal withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) to leverage Alexa, which will allow for voice-activated shopping, searching and access to smart home features.And of course, Ford expects to have its own autonomous vehicle on the market by 2021. This won't be about sourcing off-the-shelf technology, either. At the recent CES conference, Ford's engineering team said it has been creating proprietary software and hardware systems. That's important to investors because it not only gives Ford more control over quality, but it should keep margins higher, too.Lastly, Ford is working on Chariot, a ride-sharing service similar toUber. It's currently available in two cities, and will expand to eight by the end of the year.Ford Stock's Valuation and FinancialsFord continues to crank out substantial cash flows, which came to$10.4 billionfor the full year.Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is STILL Too Cheap to IgnoreThis certainly is important to help finance the investments in the company's technologies, but it also helps fund a juicy dividend that's near 5%. It's also note that Ford stock has raised its dividend by 20% since 2014, and paid out two special dividends to boot.Wrap that all up in a stock that trades at just 6 times earnings, and you have to imagine Wall Street has heavily discounted all of Ford's perceived flaws.This is a 4.8% yielder for a bargain price.

10 Facts You Didn’t Know About Tesla Motors Inc And Elon Musk (TSLA);1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElon Musk, South African-born Canadian-American business magnate, engineer, investor and inventor started out his life by dropping out of college to pursue the company he and brother Kimbal set up (Zip2), followed by co-founding X.com (Which is now part ofeBay Inc(EBAY), then even decided to venture further into the business world by setting up SpaceX.makeArticleAd();While Musk is known worldwide as a business magnate, he is probably most well known for his ventures withTesla Motors Inc(TSLA), the American automaker arguably responsible for the recent move towards electric cars.Musk, unbeknown to some is not the founder of Tesla Motors; he is the acting CEO & product architect at the company. He originally joined the company as Board of Directors chairman after he lead the Series A round of investment in 2004, it wasn't until 2008, when Tesla ran into a huge financial crisis, that Musk stepped in as acting CEO and took control of the company.Since joining the company, Musk has overseen the production of the Tesla Roadster, Model S, Model X and soon the Model 3, each time managing to lower the retail price for consumers. He has also trademarked the name ""Model Y"", speculating that he could have a plan for a new vehicle in the future, although this is yet to be confirmed. At the Future Transport Solutions conference in Oslo (April 21st 2016) Elon was quoted as saying: ""There will be future cars that will be even more affordable down the road…With fourth generation and smaller cars and what not, we'll ultimately be in a position where everyone can afford the car"", reinforcing one of Tesla's main aims of creating autonomous cars affordable for everyone.7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio AroundIn July 2016, Musk detailed a new master plan he had dreamt for Tesla, which included the manufacturing of more affordable cars at a higher volume, solar powered roofs, mid-size vehicles and even SUV's, showing just how far Musk is willing to go for a new, renewable future.So, here's to the man himself, Elon Musk and his dreams for a bigger, better, renewable future.Now, here are the 10 facts you didn't know about Tesla Motors & Elon MuskInfographic source:stanley-r-harris.co.ukThe post10 Facts You Didn't Know About Tesla Motors Inc And Elon Musk [INFOGRAPHIC]appeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) investors appear to have finally put theSolarCity Corpdeal behind them. TSLA stock has rocketed more than 40% higher since early December, and the shares have even broken through former resistance at $350.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut how long can Tesla shares keep this momentum going?The company has a major roadblock just ahead: fourth quarter earnings. Tesla has missed the consensus estimate in each of the past five reporting periods, save the last quarter when the company blew past the Street's projections.For the fourth quarter, Wall Street expects Tesla to post a loss of 28 cents per share, up from a loss of 84 cents in the same period last year. Revenue is seen rising 27% to $2.22 billion.As with every Tesla earnings announcement, TSLA stock's reaction may depend more on guidance, delivery projections and news on pending and current projects than the actual figures. Traders should keep a close eye out for news on the new gigafactory and any delivery/production updates on the all-important Model 3.Turning to TSLA's sentiment backdrop, we find little in the way of optimism. For instance, Thomson/First Call reports that only seven of the 21 analysts following Tesla stock rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. Furthermore, the 12-month consensus price-target of $240.94 represents a discount to the stock's current trading range north of $250.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryElsewhere, short sellers are loaded for bear heading into next month's report. As of the most recent reporting period, roughly 35 million shares of Tesla stock were sold short, accounting for nearly 30% of the stock's total float, or shares available for public trading.And if these short sellers are nervous about a potential post-earnings rally, they aren't buying calls to hedge their positions. At last check, the February put/call open interest ratio arrived flat at 1, with puts and calls in balance.What's more, this ratio rises to 1.49 for the 10 Feb series (i.e., those options most affected by Tesla's quarterly report).Implieds are pricing in the usual post-earnings move for TSLA stock of about 6.5%-7%, placing the upper bound near $269 and the lower bound at $236. The $269 region is home to Tesla's 2016 highs, and a breakout here could force analysts and short sellers to capitulate. Meanwhile, the lower bound lies near 10-day and 20-day trendline support.So, how do we trade Tesla from here?2 Trades for TSLA StockPut Spread:While TSLA stock is on a solid run higher, I'm expecting a sell-on-the-news event following next month's earnings. Unless the results are stellar and/or the Model 3 is ahead of schedule, expect Tesla traders to take some profits off the table, resulting a pull back in the ensuing week.To take advantage of this retreat, traders might want to consider a Feb $240/$245 bear put spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1.46, or $146 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $243.54, while a maximum profit of $3.54, or $354 per pair of contracts, is possible if TSLA stock closes at or below $240 when Feb. options expire.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is at the Top of Its RangeCall Spread:On the other hand, if Tesla blows out earnings like it did last quarter, and has some positive news to throw in as well (CEO Elon Musk is known for throwing in that one more thing), then TSLA stock could remain in bull mode for a while longer.Traders looking to take advantage of such a bump might want to consider a Feb. $260/$265 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $2.02, or $202 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $262.02, while a maximum profit of $2.98, or $298 per pair of contracts, is possible if Tesla stock closes at or above $265 when Feb. options expire.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead Weight Right NowThe post2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earningsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Consider This All-In-One Biotech Fund With a 10% Yield (CHI);1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the investing world continues to shovel money toward exchange-traded funds (ETFs) (full disclosure: I find myself using them more and more), it's almost as if the grandfather of the ETF, the closed-end fund (CEF), has been reduced to a memory like dial phones or the Nehru jacket. But when I'm at a loss for finding value in an individual stock, I often find myself looking through CEF names like a millennial at a record shop.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');CEFs can trace their origins back to the 1860s in Great Britain, when they were primarily used to raise money to build U.S. railroads. The first American CEFs appeared in 1893, 30 years prior to the first U.S. open-end mutual fund. Prior to the Crash of 1929, American CEFs claimed over $4 billion in assets, which was big money for the time.CEFs have evolved over the decades since, but their organization and basic features have remained relatively consistent. CEFs are and always have been professionally and actively managed, exchange-traded, internally leveraged, and income oriented.Recently, while screening a handful of CEFs, one piqued my interest:Calamos Convertible & Hi Income Fund(CHI).As the name suggests, most of the fund's heavy lifting is done through the use of convertible bonds, which are what is known as a hybrid security. Each bond is convertible to a pre-determined number of shares of the issuer's common stock. This gives an investor two things: an income stream and participation in the movement of the company's stock. Often, convertible bonds are issued by high-growth companies whose common stock does not pay a dividend.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe fact that the fund is managed by Calamos Investments was the attention grabber. Founded in 1977 by John Calamos, Sr., the firm became one of the investing world's premier convertible bond managers. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Calamos at a conference a few years back.Knowing the fund was managed by a true authority, I looked under the hood. 37.9% of the fund, naturally, is made up of convertible bonds while 16.4% is convertible preferred stocks.But what really excited me was the sector allocation.Over 35% of the fund is weighted across information technology and healthcare, represented by disrupters such asTesla Motors Inc(TSLA) andPriceline Group Inc(PCLN).Indeed 19.2% covers the consumer discretionary sector with another 20.3% allocated to financials, energy, industrials and utilities. The fund is noticeably underweight in telecom, materials, real estate, and consumer staples.Debuting in June of 2002 as the bear market of the same year approached its bottom, CHI sports assets of over $1 billion with total internal expenses of 1.25% which is high if you're comparing to a Vanguard index fund. But keep in mind, Vanguard index funds don't have dividend yields approaching 11%.Risks To Consider:Like many CEFs, CHY uses leverage to juice up yields and returns. Currently, the fund's leverage percentage is at 28.57% which isn't too terribly out of whack. However, portfolio leverage is like being lent an umbrella when it's not raining. When the raindrops fall, the lender typically wants it back. Therefore, rising rates are probably the biggest external risk facing the fund. This would create volatility in both the fund's lower coupon holdings and leverage position. But with the link between convertible bonds and equity markets, rising stocks should help offset this risk.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017Action To Take:The unique complexion of CHI offers conservative, income-oriented investors a unique opportunity to gain exposure to the growthiest of growth stocks in a risk-managed package with above-average income. Currently CHI shares trade at around $10.50, which is a 3.5% discount to their net asset value (NAV), with a 10.85% dividend yield that is paid monthly.Editor's Note:Since 1926,one collection of stockshas accounted for HALF of the S&P's return - through every market environment imaginable.

3 Reasons Trump Should Worry IoT Investors;1/26/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.President Trump had his fair share ofverbal scuffles with technology companiesduring his election campaign. But now that's he's the president,   his stance on federal funding for new technologies, tax credits,   and his push for more American manufacturing could have   ramifications for many companies, including publicly traded ones   betting on the Internet of Things (IoT).A few months ago, BI Intelligencepublished some forecastson how Trump's presidency was likely to affect the growth of   the Internet of Things and the companies behind it; now that   the inauguration is over, it's worth giving this information a   good look over.makeArticleAd();Here's what could change:Funding for smart city projects could dry upIn fiscal 2015, the federal government spent $8.8 billion on   IoT projects, and from fiscal 2011 through 2015, it spent a total   of $35 billion for IoT infrastructure, software, and   cybersecurity. One project involved an investment in smart cities   that allowedAT&T(NYSE: T)  bring IoT connectivity to 10 cities across the   U.S. for lighting, transportation, parking, and safety   features.But the BI Intelligence report noted that smart city   projects will likely ""stall or be abandoned due to a lack of   federal support from a Trump administration."" That's because   Trump plans for taxes would reduce federal revenues by $9.5   trillion over 10 years, leading to a major spike in the national   debt and leaving funding scarce for such high-tech infrastructure   investments. They further note that given Republicans' refusal to   acknowledge climate change, programs that subsidize   energy-efficient or green technology projects -- many of which   have IoT aspects -- are likely to have their funding cut or   canceled outright.That's important not just for AT&T and its smart city   projects, but also for broader American IoT innovations. I've   written before thatChina is leading the way in the IoTbecause its government has committed to spending lots of   money to help companies develop new technologies. If the Trump   administration backs away from IoT investments, expect China's   lead on the U.S. to widen even further.Self-driving car innovations could slowIf you're thinking that Trump couldn't possibly have influence   over the autonomous car revolution, consider that   electric-vehicle makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has released some of themost advanced semi-autonomous hardwareand software to date.Many of Tesla's vehicles are purchased with the help of   federal tax credits, but under Trump -- who does not have a   particularly fond view of environmental policies -- green energy   tax incentives could be reduced or eliminated.Tax credits of this type have pushed down the cost of current   plug-in electric cars like the Model S, and could help reduce the   cost of the cheaper, upcoming Model 3. New versions of the Model   S and the upcoming Model 3 will have a full suite of self-driving   hardware built into them, but if that green tax credit   disappears, as an analyst from AutoPacificbelieves it could, then the higher prices could significantly slow the sales   growth of Teslas specifically, and impede the spread of   driverless car technology in general.Automation might be less desirableA big part of the IoT involves companies using an internet   connection and sensors to automate systems and analyze data. In   the manufacturing sector,General Electric(NYSE: GE)  uses internet-connected machinery and software   to increase plant efficiency, both in its own factories and in   those of other companies.In huge plants, keeping track of all the physical parts used   to manufacture a product can be tricky. So instead of keeping the   chaotic and cost-prohibitive old systems (where people would run   around a plant trying to track down parts) GE created its Work in   Process Manager -- powered by its Predix software -- that   automatically tracks manufacturing. The company says that the   system allows supervisors to ""immediately know where any parts or   components are in the plant.""Trump wants to increase the number of manufacturing jobs in   the U.S. which isn't a bad thing. But that could lead to him   attempting to put pressure on manufacturing companies to keep   people employed in jobs that could instead be automated with IoT   tech like GE has developed. If companies fear that using IoT   systems to become more efficient will put them in conflict with   the administration, expect to see some businesses submit, even if   it means their expenses are higher than they would have been by   adopting the newest technology.Of course, there's no guarantee that Trump will cut green tax   credits, reduce federal funding for new smart city projects, or   put any federal pressure on companies that will impair   manufacturing innovations. But he has certainly indicated that   he's willing to push hard against companies when he doesn't agree   with what they're doing -- and that means IoT investments could   certainly be at risk.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why BMW and Nissan are Building Electric-Car Recharging Stations in the U.S.;1/25/2017;"BMW AG(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) andNissan Motors(NASDAQOTH: NSANY) announced that through their joint efforts, a   slew of new electric-vehicle fast-charging stations have recently   been installed across 33 U.S. states -- and there are more to   come.What BMW and Nissan said about the new charging stationsThe two automakers have beenworking together since late 2015to build recharging stations in the U.S. In this latest push, the   two worked with EVgo, the largest U.S. public network of ""DC   Fast"" recharging stations, to add 174 new locations in 33 states.   The stations give EVgo a total of 668 fast-charging stations   right now -- with 50 more, supported by the BMW-Nissan   partnership, set to be added during 2017.makeArticleAd();A BMW i3 and a Nissan Leaf at a DC Fast charging station.   Image source: BMW AG.The stations are 50-kilowatt dual-port DC Fast chargers with   connectors to support both the CHAdeMO (used by Nissan) and SAE   Combo (or ""CCS,"" used by BMW) charging standards, Between the two   standards, any electric vehicle equipped with quick-charge ports   can recharge at these stations.They're fairly fast, too: The stations can charge a Nissan   Leaf or BMW i3 up to about 80 percent in roughly 25 to 30   minutes. That's significantly faster than the Level 2 (240-volt)   chargers that are most commonly available at U.S. public charging   stations.Both companies say they're committed to building a strong   network of public charging stations in the U.S. as part of a   larger effort to encourage Americans to choose electric   vehicles.""BMW's continuing collaborations with Nissan and EVgo, further   demonstrate the company's commitment to building a robust public   charging infrastructure across the country. We recognized early   on that meaningful partnerships like this would be essential in   order to support the expansion of convenient and accessible   electric vehicle charging options,"" said Robert Healey, head of   EV Infrastructure for BMW of North America. ""The expansion of the   plug-in vehicle charging infrastructure will give more U.S.   drivers the confidence to choose an electric vehicle, such as the   BMW i3, as longer distance EV travel becomes increasingly   commonplace.""""Nissan continues as a leader in building accessible   infrastructure to benefit Nissan LEAF drivers as well as all EV   owners. Infrastructure for all is a key strategic priority for us   as we continue expanding the network of dual-port quick chargers   across the country,"" said JeSean Hopkins, Senior Manager, Nissan   EV Infrastructure Strategy and Business Development. ""We look   forward to ongoing teamwork and the continued build-out of public   quick-charge stations.""What it means: Small steps toward an electrified automotive   futureSlowly but surely, America is acquiring some electric-car   recharging infrastructure beyondTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) Supercharger network.These 50-kW chargers aren't quite in the same league as   Tesla's Superchargers, which can deliver up to 120 kilowatts and   add 170 miles of range to a Tesla in about 30 minutes. But   at least as of right now, Superchargers only work with Teslas.   And as noted above, these new DC Fast chargers are a significant   step ahead of the most common public chargers available in the   U.S. now. That's important: Wide availability of reasonably fast   chargers will be key to convincing mainstream auto customers to   make the leap to fully electric vehicles.The stations only work at full power with electric vehicles   that have DC fast-charging capability built in. But most new   electric vehicles can be ordered with that capability. It's   standard on 2017 models ofFord's(NYSE: F) Focus Electric and available as an option onGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt.BMW and Nissan are funding these charging stations to help   support sales of their own electric vehicles first and foremost,   of course. But the network will help rival automakers sell their   electric vehicles as well -- and that in turn should help   convince all automakers to make larger commitments to electric   vehicles.Long story short: BMW and Nissan are taking some small but   important steps to help lead Americans -- and other automakers --   toward electric vehicles.10 stocks we like better than BMW AGWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Q4 Earnings Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Tesla, Verizon & Others;1/25/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Wednesday, January 25, 2017Today's Research Daily features an updated scorecard for the ongoing Q4 earnings season and fresh research reports on 16 major stocks, including Verizon (VZ) and Tesla (TSLA). To see of all of the 70 or so research reports issued by our analyst team today,click here >>>Q4 Earnings Scorecard: Including all of this morning's earnings reports, we now have Q4 results from 105 S&P 500 members or 21% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 105 index members are up +6.5% on +2.2% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 53.3% beating revenue estimates. This is better earnings and revenue growth performance than we have seen from this group of 105 S&P 500 members in other recent periods, even after adjusting for the strong growth from the Finance sector. The proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates, however, is tracking moderately below other recent periods.You can read about the impact of the new administration on the corporate earnings picture in this article >>The Trump Effect on Corporate EarningsVerizonshares have been laggards over the past year - the stock was up +3.9% over the past 12 months vs. AT&T's +16.8% gain and the +19% gain for the S&P 500 index - and the pressure is unlikely to ease following Tuesday's mixed quarterly report that showed bigger than expected post-paid churn and lower than expected subscriber additions. The company has been actively trying to diversify its business beyond wireless by building a mobile business through the AOL & Yahoo deals and 'Internet of Things' initiatives. But it will likely take a while before these efforts bear fruit. In the updated research report issued today, the Zacks analyst discusses the pros & cons of investing inVerizon sharesat this stage.

Better Self-Driving Car Stock: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA Corporation;1/25/2017;"Right now, one of the hottest trends in the semiconductor   industry is the emerging market for autonomous vehicles. It is   generally accepted that to do proper autonomous vehicles, a lot   of computing power is going to be needed inside of the cars to   give them the required ""intelligence.""Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Two companies that have made public their intentions to   aggressively pursue the market for the ""brains"" inside of   self-driving cars are microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) and graphics specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) .Both companies have announced major partnerships and deals   with automotive makers and suppliers. Intel, for instance,   announced last year that it would be collaborating withMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) and Delphi Automotive to build platforms for use by   automotive manufacturers.Intel hasalso saidthat, in 2016, it booked self-driving car deals collectively   worth more than $1 billion in lifetime revenue.Last year, NVIDIA and Audi announced that they would,   together, try to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020.   NVIDIA's components are also found inside ofTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) new vehicles, as well.So, both NVIDIA and Intel both look well-positioned to   capitalize on a potential self-driving car boom. Which stock is   the better way to play it?These are adjacent businesses for bothIt's important to understand that self-driving car platforms   aren't either of these companies' core revenue drivers today --   they're adjacent businesses. Intel's core business is   microprocessors and related components for personal computers and   data centers, and NVIDIA's core businesses are graphics   processors designed for gaming, workstations, and data   centers.An Intel chip designed specifically for automotive use. Image   source: Intel.For Intel, autonomous vehicles are just one (potentially   significant) part of the company's Internet of Things business   (though the company did recently announce that it'd be forming an   autonomous driving group within its Internet of Things group).   NVIDIA specifically calls out automotive as a key long-term   growth segment.The reason that both companies look well-positioned to play in   the self-driving car market is because the technology that   they've developed for other markets (high-performance computing   technologies) look to be applicable to self-driving cars.   However, there is additional technical and sales/marketing work   required to succeed in self-driving cars, and both companies   appear to be making the required incremental investments to   capitalize on these opportunities.Automotive could be a bigger deal for NVIDIA than for   IntelHere's the thing: Both NVIDIA and Intel have an opportunity to   make some real money from the self-driving market. Furthermore,   the market for significant computing capabilities inside of   self-driving cars could be quite substantial, especially if many   (if not most) cars over the long term are endowed with such   computing capabilities.However, I think that the self-driving car market could be   much more interesting for NVIDIA than for Intel by Intel's sheer   size relative to NVIDIA.If Intel manages to grow its Internet of Things business from   about $3 billion in annual revenue to $5 billion in annual   revenue, then that'd certainly benice, but not agame changerfor Intel, which is expected to have generated more than $58   billion in revenue during 2016.However, if NVIDIA -- which has generated about $6.1 billion   in revenue over the last 12 months -- generates an incremental $2   billion in automotive-related revenue from self-driving cars over   time, then that's not only going to significantly boost the   company's top line, but its bottom line as well.Answering the titular questionAlthough I wouldn't recommend buying either Intel or NVIDIAsolelybased on the potential for self-driving cars (these are complex   businesses that generate most of their revenue from outside of   the automotive market to begin with), NVIDIA's business does   appear to be more likely to benefit from growth in self-driving   cars than Intel's because it's a smaller one to begin with.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor decades,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) was at the heart of the technology industry. As the company whose CPUs dominated the PC era, it was second to none. But Intel missed out on the mobile revolution and with PCs losing relevance every year, its leadership position has weakened. Nudging itself into Intel's place?NvidiaCorporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeSource: NVIDIANvidia started as a PC graphics card manufacturer, but now, NVDA stock is riding a wave of virtual reality gaming, artificial intelligence, deep data analysis, cloud computing and self-driving cars.As its GPU-accelerated products take over processor-intensive computing, is Nvidia set to dethrone Intel?GPUs Make the Leap From Graphics to Raw Processing PowerIn the old days of computing, graphics processing units (GPUs) played second fiddle to central processing units (CPUs).Intel's processors were literally at the heart of almost every computer sold. The CPU was responsible for running the computer, including its operating system. When a GPU was installed, the CPU was still primary, but it farmed off graphics-intensive tasks to the GPU. Most PCs used integrated graphics that were built into their Intel CPU. Graphics cards from companies like Nvidia - with a standalone GPU - were primarily used in specialized gaming PCs.It helps to think of the CPU as a generalist, while the GPU does one thing over and over. This difference began really turning to the advantage of NVDA about a decade ago.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaDesktop PC CPUs from Intel might have four cores, letting the CPU manage a handful of different tasks simultaneously. GPUs were equipped with hundreds of cores, and software developers realized they could take advantage of this raw parallel processing power for much more than just graphics. The GPU could be used to greatly accelerate software performance when repetitive tasks are being performed - encoding video, for example, or data analysis.GPU acceleration can make some tasks 100 times fasterthan a CPU alone.Because the GPU is designed for one primary purpose - everything including computer graphics boils down to crunching numbers - NVDA is able to produce them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equivalent performance level, while producing less heat and using less power.Why GPUs Are in Higher Demand Than CPUsWhy the demand for GPUs?Think of how the demand for processor-intensive computing power has increased over the past decade. One early example was Bitcoin. The virtual currency could be purchased, but it could also be ""mined"" by using a PC to run a complex algorithm in search of Bitcoins. Miners soon discovered that a GPU - with its parallel number-crunching capability - was far more effective than a CPU at mining Bitcoins.Anywhere from 50 to 100 times faster. Soon miners were running rigs consisting of multiple GPUs connected together.Meantime, GPUs have rapidly become more powerful, with more cores and faster clock rates, even as CPU development has become relatively incremental.Intel's new seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU for desktop computers still has four cores. In comparison, Nvidia's latestTitan X graphics cardhas 3,584 processing cores on tap. The Intel CPU costs less than a third of the Titan X's $1200 MSRP, but when used in number-crunching applications, the Nvidia card's price is a steal.The technology that has the big potential for future growth involvesextremenumber crunching. Think virtual reality, the hottest trend in gaming. Cloud services - which are often a single, processor-intensive task like image recognition offloaded to the web. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining and deep data - these all require incredible processing power. Computers running INTC CPUs are too expensive and too general purpose to be running these tasks. Instead, you're more likely to find server farms powered by GPUs.NVDA has also integrated its powerful GPUs into the forefront of one of the technology holy grails: self-driving cars.Nvidia Drive PX2is the company's AI car computing platform. With two GPUs providing the horsepower, NVDA says it is capable of 34 trillion deep learning operations per second. Additional units can be run in parallel for fully autonomous driving. Nvidia has alreadypartnered with multiple high-profile automakersto equip their self-driving cars with its technology, includingBMW,VolvoandTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)Growing Importance of the GPU Reflected in NVDA StockYou can track the relative trajectories in INTC and NVDA by comparing their stock prices. Over the past five years, Intel has grown in value by a little more than 40%. That's not bad, but doesn't look quite so good when you compare it to the height of PC popularity. Since 2000, when PC sales were notching14.5% annual sales growth, Intel stock has actually dropped by 10%.3 Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy Now (NVDA, ISIL, STM)In comparison, Nvidia stock is up by a whopping 650% in the past five years, and nearly 2,600% since 2000.Intel Isn't Going Anywhere, But the Age of NVIDIA Has ArrivedComputer sales continue their slow slide,down another 5.7% in 2016. Much of Intel's revenue is tied to the PC market. Nvidia is not immune to the effect of declining PC sales, either.But while INTC is trying to tie its future to technology like the Internet of Things (which is struggling with security issues and competing standards), NVDA has leveraged the massive parallel processing power of its GPUs to be a leader in multiple cutting-edge areas like AI, deep data, virtual reality and autonomous vehicles.Increasingly, it's looking like we're entering the age of Nvidia. NVDA stock reflects that reality.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 20173 Things Apple Inc.

How to Think About the Race to Self-Driving Cars;1/24/2017;"Alphabet's Waymo is one of several companies inside and   outside of the traditional auto industry working to bring a   self-driving solution to market. Image source: Fiat Chrysler   Automobiles.Who will win the ""race"" to a self-driving car?makeArticleAd();That's a question that lots of investors seem to be asking.   It's not hard to understand why: Self-driving cars could   transform the way many of us get around, and transformative new   technologies tend to offer big profit opportunities for those who   are able to see them coming.Recently, a Foolish colleague asked me to come up with some   sort of metric that might help us judge the likely ""winners"" in   the race to self-driving cars, at least among the automakers. But   after some thought, I decided that it's not so simple -- and that   the idea of ""winners"" might not be the right way to think about   things when it comes to self-driving technology, at least in the   near term.Why it's hard to tell who is in the best position to profit   bigLots of companies in, around, and outside of the traditional   auto industry are working on autonomous vehicle (AV) or   ""self-driving"" technology. Some, likeTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) are somewhat open about where they are in the   development process and when they hope to have something on the   market.But others aren't. Among established automakers and their   suppliers, details of upcoming new products and technologies have   traditionally been held very tightly, kept secret until a few   months before launch.Take the example ofGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) , which is probably among the leaders in developing AV   technology. We know that GMacquired self-driving start-up Cruise   Automationlast year and that the new electric Chevrolet Bolt is its   ""platform"" (GM's word) fortesting AV technology.A prototype self-driving Chevrolet Bolt undergoing testing   near GM's technical center in Warren, Michigan. Image source:   General Motors.We also know that GM has been working on a   not-quite-autonomous system called ""Super Cruise"" that is   comparable to Tesla's Autopilot, and that Super Cruise has been   expected to debut as an option on a Cadillac sometime this year   (althoughthat's not certain).But we don't know when GM will bring so-called Level 4 AV   technology, a system that can provide full autonomy under some   (but not all) circumstances, to market -- or how widely GM will   roll it out, or evenhowit will roll out. Will it be an option on luxury Cadillacs, a   self-driving Bolt built specifically for ride-hailing duty, or   something else entirely? (Level 5 systems that can drive anywhere   a human driver could are thought to be much further off.)The same goes for most of the other automakers: We don't know   exactly where their technology is, how much they're spending, or   when (or how) they intend to bring it to market. Will they use an   off-the-shelf system provided by traditional industry suppliers,   or will they develop a customized, more deeply integrated   solution in-house (as GM appears to be doing)?And we certainly can't tell right now how the different   systems under development are likely to stack up -- or how the   market will receive them.We can make some broad guesses as to when Level 4 technology   will come to market, and as to who islikelyto be among the first to bring it to market. But as you'll see,   that's not necessarily helpful to us as investors: It's likely   that Level 4 technology will be a commodity not long after the   first Level 4 vehicle comes to market.Why self-driving technology will quickly become a   commodityHere's the thing that many investors seem to miss: It looks   very likely the entire incumbent auto industry will have access   to Level 4 technology before long. Giant auto supplierDelphi(NYSE: DLPH) , assisted-driving specialistMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) , and chip giantIntelare working together on a Level 4 system that they promise   will be available to any automaker that wants it by the end of   2019.It will probably be another year or more after that date   before the first new cars with those systems go into production.   But at some point, likely by 2021 or so, Level 4 technology will   be a commodity: Several other companies are known to have rival   systems under development.That doesn't mean that all new cars will offer self-driving   capabilities by 2021. The systems will probably be still   expensive enough that they'll only make sense for luxury cars and   commercial vehicles (which might include vehicles built for   ride-hailing services).Winter weather poses special challenges for self-driving   systems. Image source: Ford Motor Company.They'll also be geographically limited, and they may   be limited by road conditions (think snow and ice) as well.   But the maps will expand quickly, capabilities will improve as   more cars rack up miles (and data), and the prices of the   systems' sensors and other components will drop as more are made.   Assuming that it follows the pattern set by many other new   automotive technologies over the years, Level 4 systems will   gradually become more widely available as costs drop.Long story short: Level 4 technology will probably be offered   on most new vehicles in the U.S. within a decade -- and   established auto-industry suppliers will be in a position to   supply it.Why it doesn't make sense to think in terms of ""winners""   yet""So what if,"" I asked my Foolish colleague, ""Tesla brings   a Level 4 system to market in 2019 -- but then by 2021 or so, any   automaker can buy its roughly comparable technology off the shelf   from existing industry suppliers? Does Tesla 'win'?""I think in such a scenario, Tesla would certainly win bragging   rights. That's not nothing: Bragging rights on new technology add   value to Tesla's brand in a way that they might not for a big   automaker.But Tesla is only likely to be able to make 500,000 or so cars   a year in 2019 and 2020, and that's if all goes well with itsupcoming Model 3. That's not anywhere near enough to dominate the global auto   market -- it's not really even enough to dominate the luxury-car   market in the U.S., Europe, and China. (And if the Model 3 is   anywhere near as good as Tesla fans expect, Tesla will be selling   all it can make anyway -- with or without a Level 4 system   available.)And of course the Delphi-Mobileye-Intel system will probably   have other competition by 2021, so we can't quite declare that   group to be the likely ""winner"" either, at least not yet.So where does this leave us as investors?Good question. It's one that I've been struggling to answer   for a while.Right now, the closest thing to a ""pure play"" investment in   autonomous driving (among public companies, at least) is probably   Mobileye. Mobileye is a profitable business with an enviable   client list (nearly all of the world's automakers do business   with Mobileye), But it's currently trading at over 100 times   earnings, and it's not clear that it will have the earnings   growth it will need to reward investors who buy at this   valuation.Meanwhile, an investment in a company like Delphi or GM -- orAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit --   is far from a ""pure play."" Sure, AV technology could turn out to   be a profitable business for any, but it's not likely to be   transformative (at least, not in a good way) for any of them. But   that said, it's possible (likely, really) that some companies   will come up with ways to differentiate their offerings that   allow them to win more market share or profit.Here at the Fool, we're encouraged to give our readers an   ""actionable takeaway,"" an investment idea to research or a   thought that could help you become a better investor. When it   comes to self-driving technology, my takeaway for you is this:   There are no obvious winners now, but there might be once we see   how the technology is coming to market.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 U.S.-Focused Stocks to Buy for the Trump Era;1/24/2017;"On Friday, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the U.S., an event which evoked strong reactions from both the country and the world. Promising to put ""America First,"" the president pledged to put an end to what he termed as the ""American carnage"" of rusted factories across the countries. Among his first actions on assuming office was a formal withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific trade Partnership.This is a clear indication that the President does, in fact, intend on following through on many of his campaign promises even at the cost of causing great alarm to the world at large. At this point, it does make good sense to invest in domestic focused U.S. stocks which may be ideally suited to combat any volatility investors may encounter in the days ahead.Exiting the Trans-Pacific PartnershipAlmost immediately, the President has set about fulfilling his agenda. On Monday, Trump enacted the formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This was one of his key campaign promises and could create friction between the U.S. and its Asian allies. Trump has said that he wants to promote U.S. manufacturing and will now seek to conclude one to one trade deals which could be ended within a short period if necessary.This is in keeping with a feeling among several U.S. citizens that trade deals of this nature have had a detrimental effect on the U.S. job market. Trump also met with U.S. industry heavyweights at the White House on Monday, promising to implement measures which will benefit domestic production and business.At the same time, he warned that companies moving production abroad would have to face heavy penalties. Trump talked about enforcing a stiff border tax on products which come in from other countries.Encouraging Domestic IndustryTrump also told the gathering of CEOs, which included the chief executives of FordFand TeslaTSLAthat he intends to reduce U.S. corporate taxes to within 15%-20%. This is a major cut considering that the current tax level is at 35%. Additionally, such a move would require the assent of the U.S. Congress, which of course is currently Republican dominated.Meanwhile, business leaders emphasized that the need to reduce regulations was even more important in their view. Speaking to the gathering, Trump said that he believed that regulations could be reduced by 75% or more.Previously, Trump has said he is in favor of beefing up public spending by hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. In fact, he has proposed $1 trillion infrastructure spending financed by new tax credits to goad private equity investors. Increased outlays will be aimed at improving roads, bridges and telecommunications. (Read:Welcome Trump Era with These ETFs)Our ChoicesPresident Trump has promised to bring jobs back to America, in particular those related to manufacturing. However, this may not be an easy process and certainly not a quick one. What is certain is that he has put the focus squarely back on economic activity within the country. In such an event it would a good idea to invest in sectors which are intrinsically linked to the domestic sector.In this case, stocks from the utilities, healthcare, real estate and financial services sector would be good choices.

Tesla Motors, Inc.: Self-Driving Features to Launch in 3 to 6 Months;1/24/2017;"Self-driving features forTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA)  electric vehicles may come through software   updates in as little as three to six months, Musk tweeted on   Monday. Of course, these features will almost certainly still   fall short of full autonomy, but the news is interesting since it   was generally thought that it would take longer for the company's   new self-driving add-on to begin morphing into a compelling   upgrade option.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Autonomous features but not fully autonomous     drivingMusk's reference to upcoming features for itsfull   self-driving capabilityupgrade package surfaced in a response to a question about when   customers can expect the more expensive add-on to begin   meaningfully exceeding features offered in Tesla's Enhanced   Autopilot. ""3 months maybe, 6 months definitely,"" Musk   said.Alongside the introduction of its new Autopilot sensors in   October, customers buying a Tesla now have a choice between   upgrading to Enhanced Autopilot for $5,000 or paying $8,000 for   both enhanced Autopilot and what Tesla calls full self-driving   capability. But since Tesla's self-driving package won't enable   new features until the new sensors and respective software have   undergone extensive validation and regulatory approval (where   necessary), there's been little incentive to pay the additional   money for Tesla's full self-driving capability option. After all,   customers can purchase the full self-driving option after   delivery (albeit for an additional $1,000), so there's good   reason to wait if customers won't get access to any new features   by upgrading today.But apparently, it won't be too long before Tesla's full   self-driving capability evolves into a noticeable improvement   over Enhanced Autopilot.What new features may Tesla introduce?Speculating what features the company might debut for its full   self-driving capability package first, one obvious expected   feature is improved safety. On Tesla's website, the company says   vehicles with full self-driving capability will access eight   cameras instead of four. When these sensors are activated in   conjunction with automatic steering and adaptive cruise control,   safety will likely improve significantly. Indeed, when asked this   Monday whether the additional cameras will provide value before   regulatory approval for autonomous driving, Musk tweeted back,   saying, ""Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy   features, even if [regulations] disallow no driver present.""Smart Summon is a feature for Tesla's Enhanced Autopilot, but   Tesla may build on the feature's capabilities for its   self-driving upgrade option. Image source: Tesla Motors.Another potential feature to debut before regulatory approval   for autonomous driving is park seek, or the ability for your   vehicle to drop off a driver at the entrance of their destination   and then seek for a parking spot. Similarly, Tesla could   introduce improvements for its Smart Summon, which, for Tesla's   Enhanced Autopilot, promises to ""navigate more complex   environments and parking spaces, maneuvering around objects as   necessary to come find you"" when summoned out of parking spaces   and garages. Perhaps summoning enhancements for Tesla's full   self-driving capability will enable even longer distances and   even more complex environments.The speed with which Tesla hopes to begin making its full   self-driving capability noticeably better than Enhanced Autopilot   is important. It means more customers may be paying up for the   more expensive add-on sooner. And since Tesla already delivers   every vehicle with the sensors required for its full self-driving   package, more upgrades mean incremental margin for Tesla. This   incremental margin can be used to help Tesla pour back more money   into the development of Enhanced Autopilot and autonomous driving   features.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

CVX Stock: How to Trade Chevron Corporation Q4 Earnings;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEnergy giant andDow Jones Industrial AverageconstituentChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) reports earnings Friday morning. In the days leading up to the event, traders and investors alike are both asking themselves whether Chevron will trump fourth-quarter earnings expectations, or whether the corporate confessional will cause a spill in CVX stock.Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Let's take a look at recent announcements for Chevron, analyze the CVX stock chart and determine what (if anything) the options market is suggesting will come Friday.makeArticleAd();Then, we'll set up a trade to help you capture profits from the announcement.Chevron Earnings Picture and Analyst   SentimentAhead of Chevron's Friday morning Q4 earnings release, analysts are forecasting profits of 66 cents per share. Actual estimates encompass a very wide range from 35 cents to $1.15.The mean Street expectation implies a whopping 154% earnings growth year-over-year, as Chevron reported a mere 26 cents in profit in 2016. That result came up short of views by more than 50%. We're not holding our breath, but if Wall Street is on the money this time, the 66-cent profit would represent a sequential decline of 8.3% from Q3, which surprised by 31.5% to the upside.Revenues are estimated to grow by 26% to $36.7 billion compared to 2015's sales of $29.2 billion. Here too, range views are volatile, with a low forecast of $27.2 billion compared to a Street high of $62 billion. Sequentially, CVX's revenues are forecast to jump by 22%.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017The Wall Street community is split on Chevron stock. Eighteen rate the stock a buy, while 10 maintain hold ratings. Price targets on CVX range from a low of $95 to $145 with a median estimate of $125.50 over the year.CVX Stock Short-Term Trading RecordIf it isn't obvious yet, Chevron has established a mixed record compared to actual Street profit views. Over the past couple years, CVX has beaten forecasts 58% of the time, while missing 42%.Investor reaction has proven a bit more consistent, with gains in four of the past six announcements immediately following earnings.Working backwards, CVX stock has moved 3.91%, 0.68%, -0.21%, 0.63%, 1.10% and -4.89% on a close-to-close basis. The net reaction in Chevron has produced an average gain of 0.2% in the first full session of trading. Variability of 2.86% based on a one standard deviation reading yields an estimated range of -2.66% to 3.06%.In other words, Chevron doesn't often move that much.CVX's seven-day performance has also allowed for a fairly benign average result, with shares falling marginally by 0.23%. However, the longer period has been accompanied by a much larger standard deviation of 5.14% and bumpier forecast range of -5.37% to 4.91%.CVX Stock Weekly ChartClick to EnlargeShares of Chevron are in an uptrend and providing a nice, lower-risk pullback entry point. The provided weekly view shows a corrective move of nearly 49% followed by a bullish uptrend, which began back in late 2014.Currently, CVX stock is in the process of establishing a minor counter-move of several weeks. The overall shape of the pattern resembles a bullish weekly cup-and-handle.With the handle or pullback situated above the 62% retracement level and longer-term weekly moving averages, bullish traders are provided plenty of technical support. That said, these supports comprise a fairly wide price range in CVX stock.Testing of the penetrated 50% level and 50-week simple moving average near $102.50-$104 is roughly 10% to 11% below the current share price in CVX. Such a price drop wouldn't invalidate the uptrend, but the allowance for the current handle would certainly be compromised.How to Trade CVX StockThe spread between implied and underlying volatility in CVX has widened over the past month. Not only is 30-day implied volatility mostly flat, but it continues to trade in a very narrow price band - from about 15% to just above 20% over the past few months.At the same time, statistical volatility of CVX stock has fallen to around 12% and fresh two-year lows.Sell GoPro Inc Stock on This Pointless Karma     Rally (GPRO)The at-the-money 27 Jan $116 straddle market points to a 68% chance BAC will remain within an approximate price range of $113.40 to $118.60 into Friday's expiration. The math behind the calculated range is based on implied volatility of 25%, three trading sessions and shares of Chevron at $116.The purest play on the earnings event is the weekly contract. Even during quiet periods like the one CVX stock is witnessing now, those premiums reflect what traders collectively expect to happen in the stock in the immediate aftermath of earnings.The dollar move up or down works out to wiggle room of about 2.26% by Friday's close - a fairly quiet and typical event.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Eyes $13 Ahead of Earnings;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) is set to roll another quarterly earnings report off the assembly line this Thursday. The American automotive giant gained considerable attention during the U.S. presidential election, but that buzz has failed to carry over onto Wall Street.makeArticleAd();Source:Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)In fact, judging from the sentiment backdrop, traders aren't expecting much, if anything, from Ford stock this time around.Historically, Ford has bested the Street's consensus earnings estimate in five of the past eight quarters. However, that may not mean much on Thursday, with Ford earnings expected to decline 44% to 32 cents per share from 58 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is also expected to arrive lower, down 7.2% year-over-year at $35.1 billion.And then there's Ford's whisper number. According to EarningsWhispers.com, some analysts expect earnings to fall to 34 cents per share. As you can see, expectations are quite low for F stock either way.This sentiment is also reflected in analysts data from Thomson/First Call. Currently, 17 of the 24 analysts following Ford stock rate the shares a ""hold"" or worse. Additionally, the 12-month price target of $12.83 represents a meager premium of only 4.2% to Monday's close.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017F stock options traders, however, appear considerably more optimistic. Currently, the Jan./Feb. put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.68, with calls easily outnumbering puts among options set to expire in the next month. Furthermore, this ratio plunges to 0.29 for 27 Jan. options - i.e., the most affected by this week's earnings report.The question is, are these options traders betting on a rally for F, or are they Ford stockholders looking to hedge a poor earnings performance by selling premium.Click to EnlargeIt would seem that question is answered by looking at 27 Jan implieds. Currently, options traders are pricing in a measly post-earnings move of only about 1.7%. Not only are expectations for post-earnings movement quite low, so too are F stock option premiums, decreasing the likelihood that shareholders are selling calls to offset poor stock performance.Judging from 27 Jan. implieds, the expected upper move rests at $12.46, while the lower bound lies at $12.04. Short-term support appears strong near $12, while resistance should lie closer to $13, indicating an upside potential that options markets don't seem to be pricing in.2 Trades for F StockCall Spread:I don't see any real issues in store for Ford's quarterly report, as most of the bad news is already factored into the quarter. Guidance, however, is another matter, given the unknown factor of the Donald Trump administration's protectionist plans. However, I would expect Ford to be upbeat, thus leading to an F stock rally amid low expectations.For those looking to follow the prevailing winds in the Ford options pits, a Feb $12.50/$13 bull call spread has plenty of potential. At last check, this spread was offered at 19 cents, or $19 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $12.69, while a maximum profit of 316 cents, or $31 per pair of contracts, is possible if Ford stock closes at or above $13 when Feb. options expire.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is at the Top of Its RangePut Sell:If a call spread is too bullish for you, then a more neutral 27 Jan $12 put sell may be what you are looking for. At last check, this option was bid at 5 cents, or $5 per contract.The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as F stock closes above $12 when 27 Jan options expire at the end of this week. The downside is that should F trade below $12 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $12 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio Around3 Key Blue-Chip Stocks Hogging All the ActionThe postFord Motor Company (F) Stock Eyes $13 Ahead of Earningsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is at the Top of Its Range;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy any conventional measure, today is a good day to sell stock inTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). Assuming it is truly range bound,as I have written that it is, then TSLA stock is now very near the top of its range. At $245 per share, the company is valued by the market at nearly $40 billion.Source: ShutterstockCompare that to the $48 billion ofFord Motor Company(NYSE:F), which makes nearly 2.5 million cars per year, against fewer than 100,000 for Tesla, to get a sense of perspective.makeArticleAd();But it's certain that today's bearish call will be controversial, because Tesla stock is about more than cars.TSLA as a BrandTesla has become a lifestyle brand.You can try to tease this outof its logoor just intuit some elements of the lifestyle it represents. It represents luxury, yes. But it also represents independence, likeHoward Roarkin Ayn Rand'sThe Fountainhead -the perfect hero for the Trump era.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     BackThe Tesla customer won't just buy a car. He'll buy the Powerwall, and when they come out, he'll buy the solar roof as well, no matter how much they cost. He'll get a home in the desert, live off the grid, and tell the rest of the world to buzz off. Notice that all the pronouns in this paragraph are male.That's the dream, anyway. Brands are dreams as much as they're reality. Most people who buy big pick-up trucks aren't working in construction, either.The point isthere could be a lot more revenue per customerthan investors thought when TSLA stock was starting out.What else are the bulls seeing?Tesla Stock as RealityRight now, the Powerwall batterylooks to be a hitand TSLA owners are happier about their purchasers than any other car owners,by a wide margin. What the bulls are seeing is cars that get updated like smart phones, so that theylearn from crashes.They're seeing year-old carsmade brand new, their software updated rather than the hardware replaced.It's true that next year's Teslamay be radically differentfrom last year's,  running far longer on a single charge, for instance. And that chargewon't be free any more.But bulls never see the glass as even half-empty.TSLA Stock as InvestmentTesla is due to report its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 8 with analysts expecting a loss of 20 cents per share, against a loss of $1.29 per share for the same period in 2015 and revenue of $2.23 billion.We already know that TSLAmissed on its delivery targets for the quarter, shipping 22,200 vehicles. That's less than the 24,500 shipped in the third quarter, and production of 76,230 cars fell well short of the 80,000 to 90,000 target.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep     Delivering in 2017Tesla continues to operate only because it continues to get financing. Operating cash flow was positive during the third quarter, but as with that quarter's profit, it was an outlier, as TSLA stock's positive cash flow generally comes only from financing.Digging into the numbers after earnings, analysts will be expecting to find the usual mess of no income, and no operating cash flow, of operations maintained through financing. Tesla bears should know that if the fourth quarter looks like the third, they could be in for a very rough ride.Right now, Tesla stock can do no wrong, but I'm convinced that, sometime later this year, it will seem that it can do no right. People will listen tothe critics, or the company will miss on its delivery schedule (again) and TSLA stock will drop like a rock.At that point, buy it. This is not that point. If you have money in Tesla stock, take some profits off the table. If you are waiting to buy TSLA stock, let it come back to you. If you're very brave, short it.Or do what I do, watch it from afar and enjoy the ride.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

2 Trades to Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFundamentally, nothing has recently changed forTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). We still have expert opinions falling on both sides of the fence. I make my money by selling risk via Tesla options against both extreme opinions. Somewhere in the middle lies the truth.makeArticleAd();I have been a long-time critic of Tesla stock fundamentals as a car company. But I am like a lot of traders warming up to the idea that the TSLA story is not one about cars. But until this becomes consensus, car headlines will move the stock so I can't ignore that aspect of its business.Click to EnlargeTechnically, Tesla stock has made a nice recovery. This could tempt those trapped long at these levels to exit. To offset that, there could be plenty of fans looking to chase this runner. So the drop is a potential, but not a forecast.So to trade a stock that has potential, I will set a trade that gives it space to run on both sides and let time help me profit.The Trade:Sell the Tesla stock March $210/$205 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 65 cents per contract. As long as TSLA stays above $210 per share, this trade can yield 14% on money risked. This gives me a 15% buffer from current price.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaI usually like to hedge my bets. In this case, I can set a bearish side while knowing that Tesla stock fans could cause me grief on this side. The TSLA dip buyers should be enough support for the bullish trade alone. I do not rush into the hedge; I watch the price action for the next few candles.The Hedge (optional):Sell the TSLA March $290/$295 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect an additional 60 cents per contract. This trade has a 85% theoretical chance of success for a 10% yield on money risked. I could hedge this trade through earnings by sacrificing a few pennies in a debit call spread for the earnings week contract at $290.Hit the Bull's-Eye in Target Corporation (TGT) StockIf I take both credit spreads, I would be set in a sold iron condor. Since I can only lose on one side or the other, the money at risk falls. Total potential yield if Tesla stays between both spreads sold would then be 29% on money risked. This is a range-bound trade with +/-15 % buffer from current price.Cautionary note about earnings. The short-term reaction to earnings adds a temporary gambling element to trades.

Tesla Motors Inc Again Proves It’s Not A Conventional Automaker (TSLA);1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsTesla Motors Inc(TSLA) CEO Elon Musk posted a series of tweets on Saturday, mapping an   update schedule that is more often seen among smartphone makers   than traditional automakers.The schedule indicates that the automaker is expecting to release   majorupdatesto its vehicles every 12-18 months, according toMarketWatch.makeArticleAd();Retrofits to Slow Tesla's ProgressOlder-model cars will not be equipped with the latest sensors   or hardware, and this is worrying some Tesla owners who are   seeking upgrades to their vehicles. Musk's response to these   complaints was essentially ""tough luck.""""Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong   car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18   months. . . . If we applied resources to doing super complex   retrofits, our pace ofinnovationwould drop dramatically,"" Musk tweeted.Adding self-driving tech to earlier vehicles would require   replacing 300 parts, something that needs stripping the ""entire   car,"" he added.According to Musk, cars with HW2 technology made after October   2016 are now getting Autopilot. Musk also warned owners to be   careful while their car's cameras readjust.Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No       Matter Which Way It MovesResponding to his tweet on Sunday, Musk said the auto-steer   mode is limited to 45 mph for now, but once the company gets more   driving data, it will raise the speed.Tesla Acts More Like  a Tech CompanyBefore making any major upgrade launches, traditional   automakers usually keep the same base technology for   about five years. Tesla is known for operating more like a   tech company and less like an automaker, not to forget its   fondness of conducting beta tests and constant lineup   adjustments. This all strengthens the belief that the EV firm has   no plans of settling into the familiar patterns of its   conventional rivals, notesEngadget.However, it has both positive and negative aspects associated   with it. On one hand, it guarantees owners cutting-edgetechwhenever they buy a Tesla, while on the other hand, it means that   owners will find their cars outdated in record time.This could make owners hesitant to buy one if they suspect   they will miss out on a must-have feature, notes Engadget.Of course this means the only way for owners to keep their   vehicles the most up to date is by buying new Teslas.The postTesla Again Proves It's Not A Conventional   Automakerappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Tesla Motors, Inc.: Expect Major Improvements Every 12 to 18 Months;1/23/2017;"Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk took toTwitterthis weekend with a range of updates and commentary about the   electric-car maker's products. But perhaps the most telling of   all was a glimpse into how the company thinks about releasing   major updates for its vehicles. Here's a window into Tesla's   approach to product innovation.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Frequent updatesWhen asked on Twitter whether the company would allow owners   to pay for a retrofit of their first-generation Autopilot   hardware to Tesla's October-launched improved new sensors for   Autopilot, Musk said this won't be happening.""Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire   car and replacing 300+ parts,"" Musk explained. ""Wish there was an   easy way.""Going further, Musk said anyone buying a Tesla shouldn't   expect their vehicle to keep up with future innovation in the   company's cars.""Tesla will never stop innovating,"" Musk explained. ""People   are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major   revs every 12 to 18 months.""Customer requests for retrofits are a part of an old narrative   from Tesla owners. The first major updates for the company's   vehicles came in October 2014, when the electric-car maker   announced dual-motor all-wheel drive and the first Autopilot   hardware for its vehicles. This update introduced important   driver-assist safety features such as automatic emergency braking   and collision avoidance, as well as convenience driver-assist   features like automatic steering and parking, adaptive cruise   control, Summon (a feature that allows cars to move themselves),   and automatic parking. Furthermore, dual-motor technology   improved both the range and acceleration of Tesla vehicles.More recently, Tesla began including its second-generation   Autopilot hardware in every vehicle. The new sensors will enable   an enhanced version of Autopilot and even fully autonomous   driving, after further software validation and regulatory   approval, according to the company. In addition, in January Tesla   began offering a new version of Model S with 20 miles of   additional range than its previous highest-range model, helping   the sedan achieve a maximum driving range of 335 miles on a   single charge.For someone looking to buy the highest-range Model S, this was   a significant update since the 335-mile version cost much less   than the 315-mile version. The catch, of course, is that the   335-mile version has a zero-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds versus the   315-mile version's time of 2.5 seconds.Teslarati's Gene Liuexplainedthe significance of the new, higher-range version of Model S (and   a similar update to the company's Model X SUV lineup) when price   is taken into account:Though the increase in range on the 100D is minimal     when compared to the company's performance-based P100D with 100     kWh battery pack, the price difference is substantial. A Model     S P100D starts at a base price of $137,800 and bundles in     the Smart Air Suspension feature while the     non-performance 100D is priced considerably less at     $95,800, but does not include the Smart Air Suspension. The     $42,000 price difference buys unprecedented acceleration,     however the 100D offers 20 more miles of range than the     P100D despite the lower price point. The same story can be told     for the Model X. A Model X 100D costs $37,000 less than     the P100D version and offers 6 more miles of range.Image source: The Motley Fool.Innovation is Tesla's priorityIn short, Tesla doesn't expect its current vehicles' hardware   to keep up with new vehicles for very long. Even if that means   updating its vehicles within the same model year, Tesla intends   to deliver major revisions as fast as possible. While Tesla will   continue to deliver big software updates for vehicles it has   already delivered, the company won't be expending energy on   updating old hardware.Musk summed up this philosophy in a tweet this weekend: ""If we   applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of   innovation would drop dramatically.""This fast pace of innovation is particularly important for   Tesla. While the company's annualized 100,000-unit build rate   today has established the automaker in the luxury-car market,   Tesla's scale still pales in comparison to that of other major   automakers. As Musk has expressed in the past, speed is one of   the company's greatest defenses in combating competition.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Bank of America Corp’s (BAC) Irrational Exuberance Will End;1/23/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIt seems like everything went right forBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) in the final two months of 2016. Donald Trump won the U.S.   election, bringing promises of decreased regulatory control for   the financial sector, and the Federal Reserve lifted   long-stagnate interest rates while promising three additional   hikes 2017.  All of that bodes well for BofA's bottom   line.But have the shares come too far too fast? The devil, as they   say, is in the details.makeArticleAd();Unfortunately for BAC stock, there are very few details to go   on. Despite bluster about decreased regulations, Trump has   offered little in the way of actual plans for moving forward on   allowing the financial sector more leeway.What's more, despite announcing the potential for three rate   hikes in 2017, the Fed did not lift its economic growth forecast,   setting many analysts on edge. In fact, Fed Chairwoman Janet   Yellen noted that a""cloud of uncertainty"" hung over the U.S.   economyand would keep the central bank in wait-and-see mode for the time   being.Anyone else remember the Fed promising four rate hikes in   2016?Click to EnlargeTaking all this in, BAC stock's 35% rally from November through   December brings to mind a popular phrase from former Fed Chair   Alan Greenspan: ""irrational exuberance.""In fact, BAC stock has gained just 0.24% since the beginning   of the year, with the shares locked in a tight trading range   between $22 and $23.50. And that range is narrowing fast as   traders deal overbought conditions and the urge to take profits   following 2016's year-end rally amid an increasingly uncertain   geopolitical climate.As for sentiment, analysts appear content to stick with their   bullish stance for now. According to Zacks data, 14 of the 20   analysts following BAC stock rate the shares a ""buy"" or better,   with no ""sell"" ratings to be found. The consensus price target,   meanwhile, rests at $24.79, indicating a premium of about 9.4% to   Friday's close.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You       BackInstead of reining in their ratings on Bank of America,   analysts decided to lift price targets over the past month to be   more inline with their bullish outlooks.  However, with BofA   stagnating throughout January, it may be only a matter of time   before this sentiment picture tops out and reverses course.As for BAC options traders, this speculative bunch is also   leaning heavily bullish on the shares.  For instance, the   February put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0.64,   down sharply from even its pre-earnings perch near 0.88. That   said, there remains a lack of heavy out-of-the-money call   accumulations in the Feb. series, hinting that despite the   bullish appearance, BAC options traders may be preparing for a   reversal.Overall, February implieds are pricing in a move of about 3.2%   heading into expiration. As a result, the upper bound for the   expected move lies at $23.23, while the lower bound rests at   $21.77.2 Trades for BAC StockPut Spread:Traders looking for BAC stock to finally give in to   uncertainty and profit taking might want to consider the Feb   $21/$22 bear put spread.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: AT&T Inc.       (T), McDonald's Corporation (MCD) and Tesla Motors Inc       (TSLA)At last check, this spread was offered at 20 cents, or $20 per   pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $21.80, while a maximum   profit of 80 cents, or $80 per pair of contracts, is possible if   Bank of America shares close at or below $21 when February   options expire.Put Sell:If betting directly against BofA feels a bit premature to your   risk profile, then a more neutral-to-bearish stance may be more   appealing. Along those lines, a Feb $20 put sell should do well   in taking advantage of BAC's recent stagnation.At last check, this put was bid at 5 cents, or $5 per   contract. The upside, as usual, is that you keep the premium as   long as BAC stock closes above $20 when these options expire. The   downside is that should Bank of America trade below $20 ahead of   expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at   a cost of $20 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Short Squeeze Stocks With 10-Bagger       Potential7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's       ""America First"" PlansThe postBank of America Corp's (BAC) Irrational   Exuberance Will Endappeared first onInvestorPlace."

(T)AT&T is quickly losing customers, an analystrevealed early in the weekend.The company's wireless Internet business has experienced a   reduction in the number of users who use the service. It appears   AT&T's competitive rates … well, might not be so   competitive.A Cowen and Company analyst said in a new research note that   AT&T continues to see fewer customers sticking around each   quarter. The other top three carriers in the country -Sprint Corp(NYSE:S),T-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS) andVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) - all appear to be siphoning customers from AT&T.

3 Top Driverless Car Stocks to Buy Now;1/21/2017;"Image source: Waymo.I bought a new-to-me car recently, and I realized that by the   time I'm in the market for another one, we'll likely beknee-deep into the driverless car   transformation. That's becauseIHSestimates that there will be 76 million partially to fully   autonomous vehicles on the road worldwide by 2035.That's not as far away as it may seem and this shifting   automotive market -- which will be worth $77 billion less than 20   years from now -- leaves plenty of opportunity for long-term   investors to benefit.makeArticleAd();If you're looking for top driverless car stocks that are   leading the pack, you many want to considerAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) , andTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .New name, same self-driving leadershipAlphabet's self-driving team was recentlyspun off into its own companyand now goes by the name of Waymo. To date, Waymo has   logged nearly 2 million miles of self-driving on the road and 1   billion miles of simulated driving in 2016.That makes Waymo a leader in the driverless car space, because   one of the most important aspects of letting cars drive   themselves is giving them direct experience in handling the   myriad of situations they'll encounter in the real world.And Waymo proved recently that it's much more than just an   Alphabet side project when it announced that it's developed its   own LIDAR technology that is90% cheaper than the previous systemit was using. LIDAR sends out light signals that bounce off   objects around it in order to tell self-driving vehicles what   things (cars, buildings, pedestrians, etc.) are around it.Though the new technology is much cheaper, Waymo says it's   accurate enough to tell which direction a pedestrian is looking   (which is helpful when a driverless car is trying to determine   where a person might walk).Waymo is setting itself up to benefit from the driverless car   market by selling its hardware and software as a service. Some of   the details are still unknown, but Waymo showed its hand recently   when it announced a partnership withFiat Chryslerto test self-drivng car services starting this year.Waymo's president and CEO, John Krafcik,said recentlythat the company will have its next prototypes on public roads   some time this year, further solidifying the company in the   driverless car space.Don't forget ChinaSelf-driving vehicles get a lot of attention in the U.S., but   China could end up being one of thebiggest users of driverless car tech-- and Baidu might benefit the most.The company is often called the Google of China, because it   controls everything from countries largest search engine, earns   most of its revenues from advertising, and has some of the   world's most advanced self-driving technologies as well.Baidu is already testing its technology in cities across China   and plans to release more driverless vehicles on the road next   year, with the goal of bringing mass-produced driverless cars to   market by 2021. The company benefits from China's relaxed   position on self-driving regulations and the country's need to   improve transportation its famously large cities.It's still unclear how Baidu will make money from its   driverless car pursuits, but it wouldn't be surprising to see the   company go the same route as Waymo and strike up a partnership   with an automaker to launch a self-driving service or sell its   technology directly to automakers.The carmaker playInvestors shouldn't make the mistake of overlooking Tesla's   driverless car opportunities or the huge strides the company's   already taken. Tesla began adding all of the necessary hardware   to make all its vehicles fully autonomous just a few months ago,   something no other carmaker is even close to doing.All of the hardware isn't turned on right now, but it'll use   the technology to collect driving data to improve its   semi-autonomous software. When enough information has been   collected in real-word situations, Tesla will then offer owners   the option toactivate the hardware.Tesla also recently posted a video of its semi-autonomous   Autopilot technology driving a person around town in the fog   while navigating intersections, pedestrians, traffic, and even   bicyclists. Tesla has already talked about plans to let its   owners rent out their vehicles to others when they are not   utilizing it, and CEO Elon Musk says the time frame for fully   autonomous Teslas could happen by the end of this year.In a move that further proves the company's commitment to   self-driivng technology, Tesla recently announced that it'll be   using technology from another driverless car tech leader,NVIDIA Corporation's(NASDAQ: NVDA) . Tesla will use NVIDIA's supercomputer in its   new cars to help them process all the visual information   collected and give the vehicles optimal image recognition   capabilities through NVIDIA's GPUs.There's no going back nowWhile driverless cars may still seem like a long way off,   automakers are continually adding incremental self-driving tech   to their vehicles and the U.S. government is providing new   opportunities (and much-needed rules) for making these   technologies a reality. Investors looking for a new technological   shift to bet on should look no further than driverless cars --   and consider any of the companies listed above.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Tesla Needs To Be Cautious In China;1/20/2017;"Recently, Tesla Motors (TSLA)announcedthat its new car owners in China will no longer enjoy free supercharging for the life of the vehicle. This is in line with its global policy and does not impact existing owners who ordered their cars before January 15th. However, consumers in China are critical of this policy and have started doubting Tesla's other promises. The company faces tough competition in the region with local companies building cheaper electric vehicles. AChinese start up NextEValready claims to have built the world's fastest electric vehicle, which is likely to be cheaper than Tesla's Model 3.  The Chinese branded electric-vehicles market is supported by huge government subsidies as China looks to build global leadership in clean energy. The Chinese government has a target of5 millionelectric vehicles to ply on the country's roads by 2020 and is subsidizing local players to achieve large scale production. However, these local vehicles do not offer the luxury and long range of Tesla and are likely to gain market share on their lower costs. With China on track to become the largest electric vehicles market in the world, several players are looking to enter this market with a wide range of offerings creating a stiff competitive environment for Tesla. Audi announced recently that it would introduce five new electric vehicles in the country over the next five years. General Motors' Chinese joint venture is investing $ 3.8 billion in electrification and developing 10 'new energy' models by 2020. And the Indian company Mahindra is looking for a joint venture in China to manufacture and sell electric vehicles in the region.See our full analysis for Tesla MotorsChinese customers are not ""automatic"" fans of Tesla and might look for other luxury and value-based electric alternatives. Tesla's change in this life-of-car charging policy is likely to impact value-seeking customers more, given that they are price sensitive to begin with. Tesla's Model X, which is its ""mass scale"" electric vehicle, is more likely to be impacted by the change in its ""free charging for a life time"" policy and wider availability of other cheaper brands. Tesla's charging rate is a ""guide"" rate which can be increased in future. Any increase in this rate can irk Chinese customers since they are averse to price increases.makeArticleAd();So far, Tesla has had a good innings in China. Its Model 3 reservations in China were higher than any other country in the world, other than the U.S.  and the company is considering construction of an assembly factory in the region. While this is a strong indicator of the company's growth potential in the region, it needs to tread carefully in China. Players across the globe are looking to capture the Chinese EV (i.e., electric vehicle) market and competition especially for the low priced Model 3 is likely to get tougher. According to our estimates, Tesla's Model 3 (Gen III) is the most important segment of its business accounting for nearly 50% of its valuation. We expect Gen III to capture a 20% market share in the global EV market by the end of our forecast period.While the electric vehicles market is still at a nascent stage, China is the most important region for players in this segment. With government subsidies and high demand for EVs, several players are looking to establish themselves in the region. Tesla is likely to be a key player in this market with its luxury offerings, long range and wide network of supercharging stations. However the company needs to be cautious of the Chinese sentiment as it looks to grow further in the region.Understand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock   Price at TrefisView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years;1/20/2017;"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to “Make America great again,” promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.We won’t know for certain which of Trump’s policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trump’s policies take shape.makeArticleAd();Lower Corporate TaxesTrump’s promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.Beyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump — given his pro-business stance — were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (TSLA) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.“Repeal and Replace”The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to — among other things — “insure the un-insurable.” Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle you’re on, Obamacare either did its job or was a “complete disaster,” according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its  exposure to any changes Trump might make. What’s more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.Not every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).Scale Back Dodd-FrankCutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money — something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS), financials are once again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. ""There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank ""the number one priority on the regulatory side.”To that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes it’s tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’s not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial (PNC), which Trump has made great again."

Why Boring AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Can Work For (Or Against) You;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips""Boring is good"" forAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T), according to InvestorPlace writer and IPO Playbook Editor Tom Taulli, and for whatever it's worth, I mostly agree. But really, what choice do I have? AT&T as a corporate entity has existed for over 50 years above the average American lifespan. This isn't Elon Musk andTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). And I highly doubt that there are T stock fan boys trolling the internet to defend the honor of AT&T.Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrMaybe that's a bit of a low blow. T stock isn't irrelevant by any means. In fact, AT&T scored the biggest ""T"" of our media ecosystem - as in Taylor Swift.makeArticleAd();I don't need to haul in loads of statistics for you to understand the marketing power behind the company's ""Taylor Swift Now"" experience. Just by name recognition, AT&T can piggyback off the social media and pop culture phenomenon.But will this and other deals translate to profitability for T stock investors? The initial signs don't look too hot. Presently, AT&T stock is just a few cents higher than when ""Taylor Swift Now"" launched. At one point, T was up 4% generated by the enthusiasm.Why Investors Love T stockAt the same time, T stock just gave investors a 30% return last year. Obviously, they're doing something right. It would be intellectually dishonest not to acknowledge and credit the successes of AT&T.First, the venerable company is making some savvy moves. The most conspicuous of these is the acquisition ofTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). Although this deal has its own set of inherent risks - we are talking about media and entertainment, after all - AT&T is loaded with money. More importantly from an administrative perspective, itsfree cash flowis indeed free and flowing. If anybody can absorb the risk, it's T stock.10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's     ""America First"" PlansThen there's the exciting details written in the fine print. The company has revamped its acquisition of DirecTV with standard-bearing streaming services. Also, the introductory rate for new DirecTV customers is $35 a month, which then moves up to a still agreeable $60 regular rate. Best of all, the platform is well-integrated with others, includingApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV andAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV.If initial reports are anything to go by, T has a big winner on its hands. There's good reason to believe that the late winter rally of AT&T stock was primarily attributed to DirecTV's popularity.Of course, anyone that has had their eye on T stock knows that the AT&T dividend is a huge draw. With a 4.7% yield, that is very difficult to ignore. This is all the more true considering that high rates of passive income typically carries significant capital risk. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty certain that this company isn't going anywhere any time soon. Furthermore, the payout on the AT&T dividend has steadily increased over the last 32 years.Is the Relationship With AT&T Getting Old?So why on earth would anyone cast doubt on T stock? The problem for me is that AT&T is in the maintenance business. As Taulli notes, the company has ""79.4 million business wireless subscribers, 53.9 million consumer wireless subscribers and 25.3 million video subscribers. More importantly, AT&T has the benefit of a powerful moat - that is, a nationwide fiber optic network. Replicating this would be incredibly expensive."" Although impressive, there's not much more that T can do in that department besides annexing Canada.This is a point of heated contention, but it's definitely worth mentioning - traditional media is dying.Naturally, I'm leery of organizations and investments like AT&T stock, where salvation comes from a steadily archaic industry. And here's another scary thought: According toInc, a majority of millennialsdon't even watchtelevision.Don't Sweat Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock --     Here's WhyThis leads to a disconcerting theory. Maybe it's not that T stock is irrelevant; rather, it's their core business that is losing influence. If AT&T's investments are focused on chasing yesterday's trends, that might be a hindrance when tomorrow comes around.At the end of the day, none of this matters depending on your personal perspective. If you're looking for growth and have the time frame to take on heavier risks, avoid T stock. It just doesn't have the speculative potential that's necessary to reliably produce great gains. In addition, the AT&T dividend isn't that big of a deal unless you're putting serious capital to work.Which then brings T stock to where it most belongs - in a conservative retirement portfolio. For that purpose, there aren't that many superior candidates. It's boring as heck, with a little bit of spice to not have you go comatose.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second     Wind7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThe postWhy Boring AT&T Inc.

Should You Take the Wheel in General Motors Company (GM) or Ford Motor Company (F)?;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI remember stopping at a roadside gas station in Arkansas as a child and seeing a bumper sticker that read ""I'd rather walk down the highway holding a Ford steering wheel than drive a Chevy."" Of course, immediately next to this sticker was an almost identical one that read ""I'd rather walk down the highway holding a Chevy steering wheel than drive a Ford."" While my eight-year-old mind found both stickers to be hilarious and somehow profound, I wasn't sure - as the owners of a Pontiac - where my family stood in this pecking order.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)I try to be a little less tribal when it comes to investing. I'm comfortable owning bothGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) stock if the prices are compelling enough. (And in fact, I do own both GM stock and F stock in my Dividend Growth portfolio.) But today, we're going to do a good, old-fashioned Ford vs GM stock smack down.GM Vs. F: ValuationI'll start first with valuation. The entire auto sector looks cheap right now, and General Motors and Ford are certainly not exceptions.At current prices, GM stock trades for a ridiculous 4.3 times trailing earnings and 6.1 times forward earnings estimates. F stock isn't exactly expensive, mind you, trading at trailing and forward earnings multiples of 5.9 and 7.6, respectively. But GM is the cheaper stock based on earnings.7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeLooking at the price/sales ratio, which eliminates some of the accounting issues that can make direct comparisons difficult, it's essentially a wash. General Motors and Ford trade for 0.35 and 0.32 times their respective annual sales.So, in a world in which few stocks can credibly be called ""cheap,"" GM stock and F stock are clearly exceptions. At these prices, investors are essentially pricing in years of earnings stagnation or outright shrinkage. And hey, automakers obviously have less growth potential today than they did a generation ago, particularly with ride sharing rising in popularity and the concept of a car as a service rather than an asset is starting to take shape. And the strong sales of recent years will probably take a breather. But at 4 to 6 times earnings, it's hard to argue the bad news wasn't priced in a long time ago.Winner:General MotorsGM Vs. F: DividendNext, let's consider the dividends. At current prices, General Motors and Ford sport dividend yields of 4.1% and 4.8%, respectively, making both high yielders by the standards of today's market. So F stock looks ever so slightly more appealing based on the raw yield.Of course, there is more to a dividend than just its current yield. There is also the issue of growth. Since reinstating its dividend in 2014, General Motors has already raised it 27%. Over that same period, Ford has raised its regular dividend by a smaller 20% but also paid two special dividends that collectively equal a full two quarters' worth of regular dividends at the current rate. So when it comes to dividends, Ford is the clear winner here.Winner:FordGM Vs. F: Future ProofingI'm going to skip the usual banter about whether the Chevy Silverado or the Ford F-150 sells more trucks next quarter. No, instead we're going to focus on which one of these old-economy companies is doing a better job of preparing for the future.I'll start with General Motors. GM is looking to compete head on with the likes of electric car leaderTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) with the Chevy Bolt. Now, Tesla clearly wins that contest based on both style and performance, but the Bolt is no slouch. For drivers wanting to move beyond the internal combustion engine, the Bolt is a viable option.But even bigger in my mind are GM's embrace of both ride sharing and autonomous self-driving cars via its partnerships with bothLyftandUber. Last year, GM inked deals with both ride sharing companies to profit from the transformation of car transportation from a personal asset to a pay-as-you-go service.Rather that bury their heads in the sand, GM's leaders are embracing this trend. And GM's partnership with Lyft will ideally create the infrastructure to make self-driving cars a practical reality for the masses.Short Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock While It's OverhypedFord is making its own efforts, of course, with a goal of creating its own fleet of self-driving cars by 2021. Ford also has an electric version of the Focus. But all in all, GM seems to be doing a slightly better job of embracing the future. We're still early in the game, and a lot can happen. But for now, I'm giving the nod to General Motors.Winner:General MotorsThis gives GM the slight edge overall. Of course, no one ever said you have to choose just one. I'm currently long both and expect both to be solid performers. Though I could only make one my choice forInvestorPlace's Best Stocks for 2017, and that distinction goes to GM stock.Charles Sizemore is the principal ofSizemore Capital, a wealth management firm in Dallas, Texas.As of this writing, he was long F and GM stock.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in 2017The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for RetirementThe postShould You Take the Wheel in General Motors Company (GM) or Ford Motor Company (F)?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Will Solar Manufacturing Be a Costly Mistake for Tesla?;1/20/2017;"When it bought SolarCity late in 2016,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) may have taken on a manufacturing challenge that   makes automobiles look easy. The solar industry has left a string   of bankrupt manufacturers over the past decade, and a price drop   of over 30% in 2016 alone could be a sign that more revenue   pressure is ahead.Amid this backdrop, Tesla is trying to make new technology   work at scale, is bringing in a new partner, and is launching the   solar roof. That's a lot to take on all at once, and it could be   more than even Tesla can handle.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Tesla's manufacturing plans are complicated, at     bestSolarCity was in the process of building out manufacturing   capacity using technology it acquired from Silevo when it was   acquired by Tesla. The acquisition meant bringingPanasonic, Tesla's battery partner, and its HIT technology into   SolarCity's plant.Panasonic's technology has similarities to Silevo, but is   different enough that they're not a natural fit. There's also the   small complication that Silevo uses a 156 mm cell and Panasonic   uses a 126 mm cell. In other words, bringing SolarCity, Silevo,   and Panasonic technology under one roof is far from a trivial   task.It's unclear how much equipment was installed before the Tesla   acquisition, but there's certainly some Silevo technology in   SolarCity's Buffalo facility. In its research,PV Techalso cited job postings that included language about Silevo   technology as evidence that Panasonic won't be the sole   technology in the plant.We also know that Tesla will be making solar roof cells and   shingles in the Buffalo plant. In other words, Tesla will need to   manufacture three separate products in the facility.Solar manufacturing is hardMaking one solar product cost competitive is hard enough. But   Tesla is now trying to make three products simultaneously, and is   facing a solar industry that currently is under pricing pressure.   The price of solar panels fell over 30% in 2016, and prices are   now around $0.40 per watt for commodity solar panels, which, not   coincidentally, is what SolarCity is still installing as it ramps   up solar manufacturing.Neither Tesla or SolarCity has given any information about   what efficiency or costs look like coming out of in-house   manufacturing to this point. But given delays in launching solar   panels and the fact that Panasonic had to be brought in as a   partner, we can discern that it isn't going well.The financial impact could be big if manufacturing fails. New   York was nice enough tobuild the $750 million plant and buy equipment   for it, but that came with a commitment to spend $5 billion in the   state over the next decade, including hiring 1,460 high-tech   workers. And SolarCity estimated it would still spend around $150   million in capital costs at the plant, plus cost overruns. If   SolarCity, and now Tesla, fails to meet obligations for   investment and job creation in New York it could be obligated to   pay $41.2 million per year as a ""program payment"". If panels   aren't competitive, it's safe to say the impact on Tesla could   measured in the hundreds of millions in losses.Why Tesla doesn't need solar manufacturing in the first     placeAt the same time that Tesla is trying to complete   manufacturing plants to make three products, competitors are   improving technology and lowering costs. On top of the already   low and declining costs for commodity panels, many   manufacturers are building out mono-PERC high-efficiency   manufacturing capacity. Mono-PERC technology that's being built   out is comparable in efficiency to what Panasonic was producing,   so Buffalo may not have much, or any, efficiency advantage over   competitors.In other words, Tesla could be buying solar panels in the open   market that would be similar to what the Buffalo plant would   make. No headaches, no risk, no promises to invest in   manufacturing capacity that may not be cost competitive at   scale.It looks like getting into solar manufacturing was an   unnecessary risk for SolarCity, and now it's a problem for Tesla.   Investors should hope it's not a distraction that becomes a   financial drain, something the company doesn't need right   now.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Short Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock While It’s Overhyped;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsShares ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) rose over 2% yesterday on the heels of an upgrade by Morgan   Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. TSLA stock also broke out past   some major resistance at the $235 level as well.While Tesla bulls are rejoicing for now, however, the party   should be short-lived, if history is any guide. To me, it's time   to take a (guarded) short stance in Tesla stock.makeArticleAd();While one can debate the valuation of Tesla stock and the   aggressive sales projections of the all-important Model 3, the   fact remains that buying TSLA stock at current levels requires ahugeleap of faith. Some may even consider it blind faith, especially   as the market cap approaches $40 billion and price-to-sales still   exceeds 6.From a technical perspective, Tesla shares are becoming   extremely overbought. Previous instances when shares were at   comparable overbought readings were indicative of significant   intermediate-term tops in TSLA.Click to EnlargeTesla did break out past some significant resistance at the   critical $235 level. While this may serve the bullish thesis well   for the short-term, it also provides the potential for a quick   and sharp reversal if that level fails to hold. Given that TSLA   shares are up over 30% since bottoming at $180 in early December,   a significant pullback would not be a surprise.Click to EnlargeMuch of the recent rally may be attributed to short covering,   as short interest continued to climb while the rally began in   earnest. But the shorts have been severely punished, so that   tailwind is diminished.7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeAlso interesting to note that Morgan Stanley is a lead   underwriter on both the secondary stock issuance and convertible   bond issuance for Tesla.Morgan Stanley upgraded Tesla stockprior to the last two times Tesla issued more stock and   convertible bonds. Kinda makes me wonder.Given the magnitude of the recent rally and the grossly   overbought levels of TSLA stock, I think a counter-trend put   calendar play makes sense. While the $235 support may hold in the   short-term, I think it eventually will give way to a sharp   reversal once the faith is broken.How to Trade TSLA Stock HereBuy Feb $235 puts and sell 27 Jan $235 puts for a $5 net     debit.The trade is 14 deltas short at inception with a maximum risk   of $500 per spread.

And they were impressive.Source:bradleypjohnson via FlickrGiven the fact that the industry has been racking up huge losses trying to sort out how to make money from Obamacare, no one was really expecting a company like UNH to increase revenues 17.6% year over year. Earnings per share were up 25%, as were non-GAAP EPS.makeArticleAd();That certainly doesn't sound like a company that's struggling to find a way through the current healthcare mess. The stock is up over 40% in the past 12 months, so it doesn't look like UNH is falling victim to confused system.While UNH lost 135,000 people in individual plans (mostly Obamacare plans) in Q4, it finished the year up 160,000 individuals. Its corporate plans saw an increase for the year of 205,000.And under a Republican controlled Congress, things should become even better for UNH. However, there will be a transition for UnitedHealth Group if the new version of Obamacare is significantly different from what has been built over the past several years.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for     RetirementBut that isn't a big issue, since all companies in the sector will have to deal with that equally.Long term, growth is built in on a number of levels. And the biggest of those is the massive numbers of baby boomers who are going to be retiring over the next decade.Researchers have even dubbed the upcoming transition the '2030 problem' because that is when most of the 75 million baby boomers will be between the ages of 66 and 84. That breaks down to about 3 million boomers entering retirement age every year for the next two decades.This is an entire new industry that has not existed before and means those insurers that can best adapt and maximize revenue from this megatrend, the better they will do.And UNH should do just fine.It is a major player in Medicaid and Medicare, so if more weight is put on that system as Congress renovates Obamacare, UNH is there.

NHTSA Drops Tesla Autopilot Investigation, Highlights Technology Strengths;1/19/2017;"In June, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety   Administration had opened a preliminary evaluation into   Autopilot's performance in an unfortunate fatal accident that   occurred while the technology was activated. About seven months   later, NHTSA says it is closing the investigation after   concluding that it did not identify any defects.But NHTSA went further than ending the investigation. NHTSA's   report on the analysis also highlighted some strengths of the   technology.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla Motors.Closing the investigationAfter NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) analyzed   Autopilot's systems, NHTSA concluded both that it didn't find any   defects in the technology and that it didn't find ""any incidents   in which the systems did not perform as designed.""""At Tesla, the safety of our customers comes first, and we   appreciate the thoroughness of NHTSA's report and its   conclusion,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement on   Thursday.NHTSA's conclusion about Tesla's automatic emergency braking   (AEB) system is of particular interest given the nature of the   fatal crash, which consisted of the Autopilot-engaged Tesla   driving on a divided highway and subsequently colliding with a   tractor trailer driving across the highway perpendicular to the   Model S. However, NHTSA said AEB systems aren't designed to   operate in situations like this.ODI's analysis of Tesla's AEB system finds that 1) the     system is designed to avoid or mitigate read-end collisions; 2)     the system's capabilities are in-line with industry state of     the art for AEB performance through MY 2016; and 3) braking for     crossing path collisions, such as that present in the Florida     fatal crash, are outside the expected performance capabilities     of the system.Further, NHTSA emphasized that Tesla's system explicitly   ""requires the continual and full attention of the driver to   monitor the traffic environment and be prepared to take action to   avoid crashes."" Suggesting the driver was inattentive, NHTSA's   investigation found the driver had ""at least seven seconds"" to   notice the tractor trailer.Interesting takeaways from the reportIn addition to exonerating Tesla, the report pointed to some   other notable tidbits about the technology and its   development.1. Tesla was proactive about considering inattentive   drivers in Autopilot's development.NHTSA found that ""it appears that over the course of researching   and developing Autopilot, Tesla considered the possibility that   drivers could misuse the system in a variety of ways,"" and that   ""the potential for driver misuse was evaluated as part of Tesla's   design process and solutions were tested, validated, and   incorporated into the wide release of the product.""2. The crash rate for Tesla Autopilot-equipped vehicles   dropped about 40% compared to vehicles without the   technology, according to NHTSA's analysis of mileage and airbag deployment   for Tesla vehicles.Tesla Model S and 2016 Model X vehicles before and after   Autosteer installation. Chart source: NHTSA.Pointing to this particular data point from the report, Tesla   CEO Elon Musk tweeted Thursday, saying the company is targeting a   90% reduction in crashes for vehicles with the updated Autopilot   hardware Tesla started including in every vehicle in October.3. Tesla could have been more transparent about system     limitations, but its warnings are more explicit now.Tesla's information about system limitations of Autopilot is   ""perhaps not as specific as it could be,"" the report said. But   information, particularly as it relates to user interface   warnings, alerts, and driver monitoring systems intended to   ensure the driver remains attentive, improved significantly in   Tesla's 8.0 software update, which NHTSA highlights:Tesla's design included a hands-on the steering wheel system     for monitoring driver engagement. That system has been updated     to further reinforce the need for driver engagement through a     ""strike out"" strategy. Drivers that do not respond to visual     cues in the driver monitoring system alerts may ""strike out""     and lose Autopilot function for the remainder of the drive     cycle.Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its new Autopilot   hardware. Image source: Tesla Motors.NHTSA's conclusion about the fatal crash is good news for   Tesla investors. Not only does it emphasize how the company's   Autopilot technology works as it's intended, but it also points   to improving safety because of the technology. And with Tesla's   new hardware being far more capable than the first-generation   Autopilot hardware examined in this report, the safety of Tesla's   vehicles should only improve.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;1/19/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) stock got clocked to end 2016. Shares tumbled from as high as $70 to just $28 today, a crushing 60% decline. Is TWLO stock finally cheap enough today, or is there room for even more downside?Source:Web Summit Via FlickrOn the plus side, numerous analysts are upgrading the firm as the price drops. And a new partnership could reinvigorate the growth story.makeArticleAd();But don't overlook the risks here either. Just because a stock has fallen a long way already doesn't mean it can't keep dropping. Before you hit the ""buy"" or ""sell"" button on TWLO stock, however, take a minute to consider both sides of the coin.TWLO Stock ConsTwilio Doesn't Have a Moat:Twilio has generated a lot of interest in its services due to affordable pricing. The company is operating with a negative 15% net profit margin. And this figure has hardly budged over the past year, even as revenue has soared. You would expect to see scale effects by this point. One alternative hypothesis is that Twilio has underpriced its services. It doesn't appear to have a genuine technological moat. Much of what the company does would probably not require excessive effort for its customers to do internally. A company such asFacebook Inc(NYSE:FB) always has the option of building their own message marketing platform. But why bother if Twilio is willing to provide the service at less than cost? However, that sentiment could change quickly the moment Twilio tries to raise prices.Valuation Still an Issue:One of the issues with low-float IPOs such as Twilio is that the stocks can run far beyond seemingly logical valuations. TWLO stock soared out of the gate, but this was likely mostly due to the limited number of publicly trading shares. Insiders still controlled the vast majority of the company. They've been slowly selling more of the stock into the market, depressing the price. However, given that initial pop to $70, many investors have a mental anchor there. They see a drop from $70 to $28 and think it must be cheap now. However, compare Twilio with other firms in its space. Its 9x EV/sales figure is still astoundingly high, and is in fact the highest in its entire peer group. The company's revenue growth rate is slowing down enough to make it difficult to justify paying up for Twilio's expensive revenues.10 Companies That Should Be in the Dow     JonesPositive News, But Stock Isn't Moving:The poor performance TWLO stock has delivered lately demonstrates the valuation issues. The company has gotten a stream of upgrades along with the announcement of a potentially game-changing partnership withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). More on this below. Despite all the good news, TWLO stock hasn't gone anywhere. After each bit of positive news or analyst upgrade, the stock pops for a day or two and then gives back all the gains. This is indicative of an overpriced stock. Owners are happy to use any pop to sell, while short sellers show no nervousness.TWLO Stock ProsNewsflow Turning Positive:In recent weeks, TWLO stock has seen many positive news announcements. In late December, Drexel Hamilton started the company with a ""buy"" opinion. Pacific Crest Securities upgraded the firm to start 2017. And just this week, two more firms weighed in, with Canaccord Genuity upgrading it to a ""buy,"" and Oppenheimer naming TWLO stock a 2017 top pick. If that weren't enough, in late December, Twilioformed an expanded partnershipwith Amazon. Amazon Web Services had already partnered with Twilio to deliver text messages for AWS customers. Now that capability will be expanded to include voice messaging, greatly expanding Twilio's reach within the booming AWS ecosystem.Short Squeeze Potential:Normally, you see short sellers pile into a stock as it soars. However, that's not always the case; sometimes short sellers pile onto a plunging stock. That's exactly what they've done with TWLO stock. As TWLO stock peaked in late September, short interest was just 64% of the float. That's a huge number, yes, but it was about to get bigger. In November, short interest topped 100% of the float (a very rare occurrence). By the end of November, short interest hit 116% of the float, suggesting that for every 5 tradable shares of TWLO stock, 6 had been sold short. This is rather sketchy, as generally exchange regulations prohibit this sort of behavior. Even with the continued weakness in Twilio stock, short interest has hardly budged - the most recent data has it at 8.8 million shares, or 102% of the float. Needless to say, any concentrated effort by these short sellers to dispose of their positions could set off a large rally in the stock.Earnings Soon:TWLO stock needs something to reset the narrative. Over the past month, Twilio has seen a variety of positive developments, centered around the upgraded partnership with Amazon and numerous stock upgrades. However, traders are still focused on insider selling and the company's high valuation level. At this point, earnings in a couple of weeks could be the catalyst that finally revives the bull case. Twilio is trading not far off IPO levels now, it'd take some gumption for the shorts to press the stock through that level. On the other hand, given the massive short interest, even a modest beat could send the stock flying. Remember that Twilio initially traded down on earnings last quarter, but buyers appeared shortly thereafter.Bottom Line on TWLO StockTraders have punished TWLO stock over the past quarter. There are certainly reasons to expect the stock could turn around. Short interest is astoundingly high and persistent.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Gets a     Meaningless UpgradeThe stock has seen more positive news lately, and earnings could be the mechanism that finally triggers a sentiment shift. However, the company still appears richly priced. And it's not entirely clear that Twilio will ever be able to ramp to any significant level of profitability. For now, this is a better trade than an investment.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek had no positions in   any of the aforementioned stocks.

These include:The impending launch of theModel 3 mass market electric sedan, which Morgan Stanley now sees arriving sooner than it had     feared, and delivering ""a significant positive impact     on earnings and our price target.""Decreased competition from Silicon Valley rivals, with     ""tech firms"" such asGoogleandAppleno longer seeming as interested as they once were in producing     whole branded electric cars on their own. Morgan thinks they're     now more inclined to just build bits and pieces of software     that Detroit can then insert into the cars that it builds (and     presumably, Morgan Stanley sees Detroit as easier than Silicon     Valley for Tesla to beat).And generally speaking, Morgan believes that America is     ""moving Tesla's way"" in its willingness to adopt electric cars     over gasoline-powered horseless carriages. According to the     analyst, Tesla ""stands at the epicenter of US high tech     manufacturing job creation,"" and will benefit     disproportionately as this industry evolves.Put it all together, and Morgan Stanley is convinced Tesla   stock will outperform the market, and assigns the stock a $305   price target -- 25% more than what the stock costs today.2. Summing up those partsThat's the big picture. Now here are a few specifics.In working up its valuation on Tesla stock, Morgan Stanley   specifically excludes, and assigns ""zero value"" to Tesla's   ""Energy"" battery business. Instead, Morgan gets the its basic   target price from valuing (a) how many cars Tesla is likely to   produce, and subtracting from that value (b) the number of cars   Teslafailed to produce as promisedlast year, and (c) the cost of ""higher capex"" as Tesla builds its   business.Working these numbers, Morgan arrives at a base value for   Tesla of $229 per share, which Morgan Stanley admits is ""slightly   below the current share price.""3. Tesla's X-factorSo how does Morgan move from $229 to $305 on its target price?   This is the third part of the equation, and it may surprise you.   The company assigns fully $76 in share price to the value of   Tesla's proposedTesla Mobilitycar-sharing service -- which doesn't actually exist yet.Its non-existence notwithstanding, Morgan boldly proclaims   that ""over 100% of the upside to our $305 price target can be   attributed to the value we ascribe to Tesla Mobility."" And   adding $76 to $229, the company finds the entire company to be   worth 25% more than it costs today.That's a big leap of faith that Morgan Stanley is making,   granted. But it's worth noting that the analyst has actually   ratcheted back its expectations. As the Fool's own Alex Dumortier   has noted previously, in 2015, Morgan Stanley said Tesla Mobilitycould be worth $244 a shareto Tesla. And ifthatprediction turns out to be true, then the stock could literally   double from today's $244 share price.Bonus thing: How much is a Model 3 worth?Granted, much of the above remains speculation -- the zero   value of Tesla's nascent battery business, and the incredible   value of the car-sharing business that has yet to begin   operations. Meanwhile, Tesla has yet to prove it can earn a   profit fromanyof its businesses over the course of a full financial year. For   the time being, the stock is still being valued largely on the   volume of cars it produces, regardless of the profits that they   do or do not produce.And this brings us to the final valuable tidbit of information   contained in Morgan Stanley's report. According to the analyst,   $81 of its $305 price target comes from Morgan Stanley's belief   that Tesla will deliver 75,000 ""additional"" Model 3s in 2018, and   ""nearly 100,000 units"" in 2020. If you crunch those numbers,   therefore, it appears that Morgan Stanley is valuing each 1,000   cars sold in 2018 at about $0.50 in added share value for Tesla   stock (75 x $0.50 = $37.50 per share), and valuing each 1,000   cars sold two years later at about $0.435 per 1,000 units (100 x   $0.435 = $43.50 per share).Knowing this may give you an idea of what to expect in future   upgrades (and downgrades) from Morgan Stanley, as Tesla delivers   (and fails to deliver) on its car delivery promises. Simply put,   for every 1,000 units that Elon Musk promises to investors, add   $0.435 to the stock price -- and for every 1,000 cars that Tesla   actuallydelivers, you can mark up the value of Tesla stock by $0.50.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2 Bullish Trades to Juice Your Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Position;1/19/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLate 2016, I wrote how to catch theFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) knife. The trade was pure profits out of thin air. Since then, Facebook stock caught a 13% rally, but it still isn't expensive. Let's trade it again.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, FB execution has been flawless. It had doubters, but management proved them all wrong. After all, it would take a major gaffe to ruin the potential of a billion users.Technically, while this is not an obvious short-term entry point, it should be a good point for a long-term trade. I am not looking to profit from this trade in the next few days. Instead, I am looking out to next year.The Ultra-Cheap Portfolio: 3 Schwab ETFs for 2017The Trade:Sell the FB Jan 2018 $100 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $4.50 per contract to open. To be successful, I need Facebook stock to stay above my sold strike while I hold the position open. Selling naked puts is risky and I only do it if I am willing and able to own FB stock at the strike sold. My breakeven price would be the strike price less the premium I collect. In this case, breakeven is $96 per share. If FB stock falls below my strike I could get assigned the stock. This means that I would own FB at a 21% discount from current levels. I also keep the premium I collect to open the trade. If I really want to juice this bullish trade, I can add a debit call setup for an even more bullish bias.The Juice (optional):Buy the FB June $130/$135 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $2 per contract to open. I stand to double my money if FB rallies past my spread. Since we are in earnings season, I could delay entry in the debit call spread or keep it a small bet. Short-term reactions to earnings add a temporary gambling element. We never know how will traders react to the earnings regardless of how good they are. Usually those reactions, if unwarranted, are short-lived and the stock should resume its pre-earnings trajectory.The Hedge(optional):Usually I like to sell credit call spreads to hedge my bet. In this case I am opting out. Instead of hedging, I can be less bullish by taking only one of the two trades suggested. Selling credit call spreads in this ""animal spirit"" market seems counterintuitive. The bulls are in complete control for now.The Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Safety in 2017I am not required to hold options trades open until expiration.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Inches Closer to Its Important Autopilot Update;1/17/2017;"Over the weekend, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) beamed a key update for its ""enhanced"" autopilot   to vehicles with its October-introduced sensor suite, or what   Tesla calls its hardware two vehicles (HW2).But there's a catch. Besides the first 1,000 vehicles already   running the new software, this update for Tesla's driver-assist   technology is only operating in ""non-actuating mode to assess   reliability,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk explained onTwitter. The full rollout of the new features, if everything ""looks   good,"" will happen by the end of the week, Musk said.makeArticleAd();Inside Tesla's model X. Image source: The Motley Fool.The next steps for AutopilotTesla's upcoming Autopilot for HW2 vehicles will be aimed   mostly at catching up Tesla's HW2 vehicles to its HW1 vehicles.   The update should include ""most"" of the functionality from HW1   vehicles, Musk explained on Twitter in December. This is in line   with the company's initial plan for the new technology. When   Tesla first announced its new autopilot sensors, it said HW2   vehicles would initially lack HW1 features as it validates the   sensors with more robust driving data.Over time, of course, Tesla expects the improved sensor suite   to deliver an upgraded autopilot experience, which Tesla calls   enhanced autopilot. And the company says the sensors will   eventually be enough to enable autonomous driving. But Tesla will   need to extensively validate and refine self-driving features, as   well as obtain regulatory approval.Enhanced autopilot. Image source: Tesla Motors.This autopilot update is just one of many new features Tesla   plans to deliver wireless to its vehicles in the near future.   After following through with its promised updates for its   original autopilot announcement in October 2014, the company has   recently been more transparent about the next steps for the   driver-assist technology. For instance, Musk tweeted this weekend   that there are still ""many improvements"" to be released for its   HW1 vehicles ""over the course of the year."" And Tesla has   promised a range of new features to eventually make it to   enhanced autopilot, including:Automatic lane changes without requiring driver inputTransitions from one freeway to anotherExiting the freewaySelf-parking when near a parking spotHowever, as Tesla's autopilot features more closely resemble   autonomous driving, the company is careful to emphasize that   these new features are ""subject to regulatory approval.""Tesla has also been transparent about its plan to make HW2   vehicles fully autonomous. The company says its vehicles will be   able to take drivers from their home to their destination without   any input and then park autonomously after dropping drivers off.   While regulatory hurdles will probably push these updates out   several years, Tesla has said it will demonstrate a self-driven   cross-country trip this year.Tesla demonstrates its new hardware's capabilities on a drive   in Calfornia. Image source: Tesla Motors.A continuous stream of new autopilot features, particularly in   2017 and 2018, will be important for the company as Tesla   increases production from a current annualized annual run rate of   100,000 units to a plan for annual production of 500,000 units in   2018. In the company's most recent shareholder letter, Tesla   listed enhanced autopilot and the hardware for full self-driving   capability among expected catalysts to help ""drive strong vehicle   order growth.""10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No Matter Which Way It Moves;1/17/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of my favorite topics in the stock market these days isTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). For anyone who likes an underdog story filled with drama and suspense, TSLA stock is as good as it gets.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)Tesla - the company - has been an incredible success up to this point. TSLA stock has also been one of the best stocks in the market in the past five years. Unfortunately, the company now has extremely high expectations, and Tesla stock has an even higher valuation. I've been very critical of the bull case for TSLA. I wholeheartedly believe it's one of the most dangerous popular stocks in the market today.Yet I am the first to admit that if the Tesla story has a happy ending, it could easily double within the next couple of years. If not, I believe the bottom will fall out of the stock and the company may end up dead in the water.The TSLA Stock Bear CaseIn the past four quarters, Tesla shipped76,000 automobiles, generated over $6 billion in revenue and registered $874 million in net income losses. Last year,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) shipped 9.8 million automobiles globally.In the past four quarters, GM generated $162.1 billion in revenue and reported net profits of $14 billion. Yet somehow, TSLA stock is valued at a market cap of $39.2 billion compared to GM's valuation of $56.9 billion.7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in 2017Why? The Tesla bull case involves the Model 3 and subsequent affordable Tesla models taking over the global mass auto market. If that's the case, TSLA stock will eventually justify its absurd valuation.I'm skeptical. Elon Musk has made too many promises that will require perfect execution to keep. Anyone who has operated in the business world knows things rarely go exactly according to plan. Tesla plans to ramp production from 50,000 in 2015 to 76,000 in 2016 to 500,000 in 2018. Musk also promises that Model 3s will begin shipping by the end of 2017 andwill startat $35,000.Just ask any TSLA stock bull, and those are the reasons they like the stock. To me, that means that at the bare minimum, all of those assumptions need to actually happen to justify Tesla's current valuation.TSLA Stock Is Too Dangerous to ShortUnfortunately for traders betting against TSLA stock, they have plenty of company. According toshortsqueeze.com, it has a short percent of float of nearly 30% with 8.7 days to cover. That means any dip in share price will likely be met with short covering. Any potential good news could also be followed by a huge short squeeze.Despite my belief that TSLA stock is extremely overvalued, these risks have kept me away from ever taking a short position in the stock. The way I see it, Tesla has so much potential for volatility in the next couple of years, both longs and shorts are playing a dangerous game.When a friend asked me the other day where I think TSLA's share price will be by 2019, I told him probably $50. Then I added that if it's not below $100, it will probably be above $500. Tesla is either going to deliver on its story with a happy ending or it won't.A LEAPS Straddle Bet On TSLA StockAfter the conversation with my friend, I got to thinking about the hypothetical $50 or $500 binary outcome for TSLA stock and what could be the best way to create a neutral trade based on that idea. The uncertainty makes long-term options very expensive. But if you agree with my premise that Tesla will be making a major move one way or the other within the next couple of years, it is possible to set up a straddle trade using 2019 TSLA LEAPS.At a strike price of $220, the Jan 2019 TSLA LEAPS calls last traded at about $57. The $220 puts last traded at around $50. If you invest equally in both options, you will require roughly a $100 move in one direction or the other to break even on your trade. That means that if TSLA ends up above $320 or below $120 by January 2019, you've made a profit. If TSLA ends up at $50, you've earned a return of roughly 70%. If TSLA makes it to $500, you've earned a return of roughly 180%.Take Advantage of a Misunderstood Fitbit Inc (FIT) StockThose returns are lopsided simply because the options market appears to be fairly bearish on TSLA stock in the long-term.If you're on the fence about which direction Tesla stock is headed in the next two years but agree with the idea that it will be making a huge move in one direction or the other, consider a 2019 LEAPS straddle trade like the one described above. Then you can simply sit back and enjoy the end of the TSLA story, one way or another.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Healthcare Stocks That Will Cripple Your Portfolio10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print MoneyThe postProfit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No Matter Which Way It Movesappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA);1/17/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointed sharply lower this morning, as Wall Street came back from the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in a selling mood. Comments from President-elect Donald Trump on China and the U.S. dollar helped spur the selloff, as Trump toldThe Wall Street Journalthat the dollar was ""too strong"" due to China manipulating the yuan.makeArticleAd();Adding fuel to the fire, British Prime Minister Theresa May is said to be pushing for a ""hard Brexit"" from the EU.Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave fallen 0.41%,S&P 500futures have shed 0.51% andNasdaq-100futures are down 0.52%.On the options front, Friday's volume was brisk heading into the three-day weekend. Overall, roughly 15.4 million calls and 13.4 million puts crossed the tape on Friday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio whipsawed to 0.63 from Thursday's one-week high of 0.68, while the 10-day moving average held steady in two-month high territory at 0.67.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) call volume received a pre-earnings boost from Raymond James, which upgraded the stock to ""strong buy."" Elsewhere,T-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS) saw call volume ramp up amid the FCC's spectrum auction, which has led to increased speculation on merger activity in the telecom sector. Finally,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was also call heavy after the company detailed its plans to charge for supercharging stations across the country.Facebook Inc (FB)Front-running the social media giant's quarterly report,Raymond James lifted Facebook stockto ""strong buy"" from ""outperform"" on Friday.10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print MoneyAccording to a research note, social media ad spending was strong in the fourth quarter, with Raymond James stating that channel checks indicate an increase in ad spending of about 20% to 30%. The brokerage firm reasoned that Facebook should now easily hit ad growth estimates of 35%.FB stock rallied 1.36% on the news, finally filling in November's post-earnings gap lower. The combination of technical and fundamental strength pushed options traders toward FB call options in droves on Friday. Overall, Facebook saw volume reach over 962,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 70% of the day's take.Looking out to 3 Feb options, however, FB options bulls are still playing catchup. Currently, peak call open interest rests at the in-the-money $123 strike, totaling 9,800 contracts - well short of FB's current perch north of $128. In the $128 region, there are roughly 3,400 contracts at each of the $129, $130 and $131 strikes in the 3 Feb. series, i.e., the one most affected by Facebook's coming quarterly report on Feb. 1.T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS)TV broadcasters have once again lowered their asking price for prime wireless spectrum in the ongoing FCC auction which began in March. Broadcasters were originally asking $86 billion for the wireless spectrum, but have sincelowered their price to just $10 billion, and potentially setting the stage for a failure of the auction if none of the major wireless carriers bite. T-Mobile certainly could use the spectrum, having outgrown most of its current bandwidth. However, a failure of the auction could lead to another round of merger and acquisition activity in the telecom sector.Options traders ramped up speculation on TMUS stock on Friday following the news, as T-Mobile has long been seen as a prime acquisition candidate. Total volume on Friday rose to 367,000 contracts, with calls making up a whopping 99% of the day's take.Diving into the activity, however, reveals that about 180,000 of those contracts - more than half - were involved in one spread trade at the Jan. 2017 $50 and $55 strikes. According toTrade-Alert.com, blocks of 90,000 contracts traded on both the Jan 2017 $50 and $55 strikes for the respective bid prices of $2.84 and $7.55.Without additional information it is impossible to tell exactly what is going on here, but it would appear to be the closure of a bull call spread ahead of expiration this Friday. If so, the trader netted a profit of $4.71, or $471 per pair of contracts, on the trade.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)On Friday, Tesla Motors detailed how it would be handling plans to begincharging for use of its supercharger network- plans for which were hinted at back in November. The news promptedGlobal Equities Research's Trip Chowdhryto claim that by 2020, the supercharger network would add $2.6 billion in revenue directly into Tesla's bottom line.TSLA stock leapt 3.55% following the research note.How to Trade International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock After EarningsTSLA options traders also rallied behind the bullish note, sending nearly 350,000 contracts across the tape on Friday. Calls claimed an above average 63% of the day's take. That said, options traders remain somewhat conservative on TSLA stock's prospects.Looking at Feb open interest, peak OI totals 5,600 contracts at the in-the-money $235 strike, with little in the way of additional OI north of this region. In other words, TSLA options traders are remaining in a holding pattern until more news is known on how supercharging charges will impact Tesla's revenue.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead Weight Right Now7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in 2017The postTuesday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why 2017 Is the Year to Invest in Artificial Intelligence Stocks;1/16/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.The other day I sat in a coffee shop across from a student who   was studying a complex math problem. The equation took up the   entire page, and he sat there staring at it for quite awhile.   After I thought about how glad I am to not be in school anymore,   I started thinking about how jumping into a new investing market   can be intimidating. Like the math equation, it can be hard to   make sense of all the information on the page.But it doesn't have to be this way, especially if you closely   follow what smart companies are doing in new segments and pair   that with some good ol' fashioned research.makeArticleAd();Artificial intelligence (AI) is one such opportunity where   companies are making big bets on it and where the research backs   up its potential. And if AI pans out the way many are   thinking, then 2017 may be a very good year to get on board with   this technological shift.AI is at an inflection pointIn 2016, the AI market was worth just $644 million, according   to Tractica. This year, that amount will nearly double and then   grow exponentially from there. Take a look:Data source:TracticaandStatista.Clearly, we're still at the beginning of AI's revenue   possibilities, and its opportunity will accelerate over the   coming the years until it reaches $37.8 billion less than 10   years from now.Growth in the AI market will be spurred on by many large tech   companies that implement AI into their current businesses. For   example,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) uses its own internally developed AI programs to   read the posts we put on Facebook and understand the context   they're written in. The company's DeepText program reads   thousands of posts in just seconds and does so across 20   different languages. Facebook also uses deep learning to tag   our friends in photos, and is even using AI to identify people   (and their voices!) in videos.But AI is expanding its reach outside of the technology sector   as well. There's plenty of talk about self-driving cars these   days (I've done my fair share) and that's because the number of vehicles worldwide with some   level of autonomy will hit 76 million by 2035 -- and be worth $77   billion by that year.That growth is being fueled, at least in part, by AI.NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) is using its graphics processors (GPUs) to create   some of the most sophisticated image processing supercomputers,   like the company'sDrive PX 2. The computer is being used by 80 automakers and auto suppliers   already, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)  recently said that it would use some of   NVIDIA's technology in its next version of its semi-autonomous   Autopilot driving feature.Tesla is itself becoming a leader in AI technologies, and back   in October, the company posted a video of its self-driving AI   driving a person around in one of its vehicles --    completely hands-free -- as it navigated stop signs,   bicyclists, and foggy roads.Image source: Tesla.OK, so technology companies are obviously betting on AI's   future, and NVIDIA is proving that the automotive sector will   bank on AI as well, but it's important to note that governments   are betting on AI's growth as well.China announced last year that its government will invest in   new AI technologies over the next three years, as it tries to   create its own $15 billion AI market. And even the U.S.   government has taken notice of China's recent focus on artificial   intelligence. In areportreleased back in October, the White House said that Chinese   scientists are publishing far more AI research than American   scientists and that their work is being cited more often. The   U.S. then urged more AI research and development spending in   order to catch up and improve economic growth.The South Korean government recently turned its attention to   AI as well. AfterGoogle's DeepMind AI beat a South Korean grandmaster Go player in   an exhibition match in Seoul, the country pledged $863 million to   develop more AI technology and called on private companies to   invest even more.There's no turning back nowWith so many companies (and leading world powers) focusing   their attention on AI, there's no stopping the momentum now.   Investors waiting around to see how AI plays out could be left in   the dust, as this technological shift begins to speed up even   faster this year. Of course, there's no guarantee that 2017 will   be the best year to invest in AI. But if all of the AI focus from   2016 spills into this year, then it certainly looks like a good   bet.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Today is Thursday, Jan. 5, 2017, so   we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I'm   joined in studio by the irreplaceable Taylor   Muckerman. Happy New Year, Taylor!Taylor Muckerman:Fireworks are still going off in the studio.O'Reilly:Yeah. You know it's a fire hazard, right? You can't do that.Muckerman:Oh, really? Shoot.O'Reilly:Yeah.Muckerman:I didn't get fired yet for it. We'll change it to sparklers   instead.O'Reilly:Is that a fire hazard, Austin? Sparklers?Muckerman:Nah.O'Reilly:He's shaking his headyes. That's bad. Our producer, Austin, does not approve of   sparklers. Why do you have to be like that? It's Happy New Year,   man, come on. He's just sitting over there with ...Austin Morgan:I don't want you guys burning down my studio.O'Reilly:Nice, OK. Doesn't he have a great radio voice, folks?Muckerman:Yeah, I think we should just give up.O'Reilly:Can you just come in here and do this and I'll just get some   coffee?Morgan:I'll just take over.O'Reilly:Attaboy. You talk about hockey.Muckerman:Well, what are we talking about? If he's talking about   hockey, what are we up for today?O'Reilly:Thanks for that transition, Taylor! Look at this guy.Muckerman:Little two-arm pass there.O'Reilly:Really quickly, I just want to mention OPEC, because   it's what we do.Muckerman:Yeah. We're going to try and trim that down unless there's   something major. But, new year, I feel like we have to at least   briefly hit on it.O'Reilly:Well, this is the first month they're supposedly going to do the   production cuts they agreed to.Muckerman:Yeah, they start the cuts. Up to 1.8 million barrels a day,   including the 11 other countries that committed to --O'Reilly:Right. The big story a couple weeks ago was that Mexico was   in on it, and blah blah blah.Muckerman:And Russia, yeah.O'Reilly:I actually just saw on the wires this morning that Iraq   has already cut production. They're actually doing it.Muckerman:Yeah, they're cutting medium and heavy crude, which   is basically what everybody produces over there.O'Reilly:I'm mildly impressed with how everybody is actually doing   what they said they would do.Muckerman:Well, we don't know the degree to the extent that they   have cut. But yeah, they have started to cut, along with Oman and   Kuwait as well. There's at least three out of the OPEC   members.O'Reilly:We're 10% there, yay.Muckerman:Yeah. We don't know much about the other countries. Mexico   wasn't necessarily cutting; they were just expecting a natural   decline of oil wells, without having the replacement there.   But of those 11, all eyes are on Russia, who hasn't begun to cut   or provided any guidance of when they might decide to.O'Reilly:I get the distinct impression that Russia views the world as   being on a need-to-know basis.Muckerman:Yeah. I think maybe they're waiting to see what happens when   everyone else cuts, and if prices rise,   they're probably going to be like, ""Well, you know   what? Thanks, guys!""O'Reilly:Well, you know that Saudi Arabia already increased their   prices -- you know how they set monthly prices to Asia and   the U.S. and stuff. They already upped it a little bit because of   the cut. They're like, ""We cut production, so we're upping the   price.""Muckerman:Yeah, upping prices. But we mentioned this a couple weeks   ago, straight from the mouth of the former Saudi   Arabian oil minister talking about OPEC and their previous   cuts, saying, ""We tend to cheat."" So, we'll be surprised to see   100% of that 1.8 million barrels per day   cut. Analysts I've seen, aGoldman Sachsanalyst says he believes around 84% of that total will   be achieved. I've seen as low as 70%.O'Reilly:Well, before the holiday, you said ""historically."" You said,   you usually get about two-thirds? Over the last 40 years or   whatever.Muckerman:Yeah, I think it falls right in that 60%-75% range.O'Reilly:If we got 83%, that'd be a win.Muckerman:Yeah, historically, it would be a win.O'Reilly:Good for them. Moving on, very briefly, to our likely   next Secretary of State under the Donald Trump presidential   administration --Muckerman:Still to be confirmed, but moving in that direction.O'Reilly:Likely.Muckerman:Likely. No one else has been named, not even close.O'Reilly:Plus he's a really good negotiator. I didn't know he   had this much money, but I guess I should have assumed.Muckerman:Yeah, he's been there since he started his career.O'Reilly:So he's handing over control of $250 million worth ofExxonMobilshares, and his net worth is like $400 million. Cool.Muckerman:Yeah, he's disclosed about $400 million in assets. That includes   pension and stock he owned and the $180 million payout he's set   to receive simply for becoming the Secretary of State.O'Reilly:It's good to be the king.Muckerman:Yeah, not too shabby. But on top of that, he has holdings   in several other oil companies, producers, service   companies. You're looking atRoyal Dutch Shell,Chevron,Schlumberger(NYSE: SLB) , [General Electric]. Didn't necessarily disclose the full value of those. But yeah,   guys, he's an energy man, quite clearly.O'Reilly:With a name like Rex Tillerson, how could it be   otherwise?Muckerman:Yeah, that's wildcatter through and through.O'Reilly:You name a kid that because you think he's going to be an oil   man.Muckerman:Yeah. It's like having a kid you want to be a wrestler and never   letting him lay down on his back. That's basically what happens   when you name your kid Rex Tillerson.O'Reilly:Boom. Moving on to the oil market, the OPEC cut is actually   having its desired effect, at least for the price of oil. But   that, of course, has side effects, like the increased drilling   activity here domestically in the United States. Going to happen.   Saudi knew it. It is what it is.Muckerman:It's already happening. We saw production pick up later in the   year of 2016. You'd imagine it will.O'Reilly:And refresh my memory, I think U.S. production dropped   about a million barrels? We were at about 9.6 million and it   dropped to 8.6 million?Muckerman:Something like that, yeah.O'Reilly:ButHalliburton(NYSE: HAL)is hiring 200 workers in, unsurprisingly, the Permian   Basin. I think you sent me this article?Muckerman:Yeah. That's the hotness.O'Reilly:They laid off a ton of people, though.Muckerman:Yeah. Last year, if you looked at the announced layoffs --O'Reilly:Thousands. Tens of thousands.Muckerman:-- energy services companies were the worst by   far. Schlumberger had two of the top five largest   announced layoffs last year, and Halliburton was also right   up there. So yeah, I don't know if here's our new jobs, but   either they're shifting 200 to the Permian, or they're announcing   actually hiring 200 new folks.O'Reilly:I wasn't particularly impressed with this. One, it's like, 200   guys. Who are we kidding? Hundreds of thousands of people   have lost their jobs. Two, it's in the Permian. Not surprising at   all, either. The other headline we were talking about before we   came in here was drillers capping their record year for stock   sales with a huge bump in December, which is, again, not   surprising because OPEC gave the oil industry a wonderful   Thanksgiving present.Muckerman:Yes, they did.O'Reilly:This seems like a slightly bigger deal.Muckerman:Yes. You're looking at these companies going out there.   Mostly, these are small to mid-sized companies. You're not   seeing big equity raises from the integrated, or anything   like [EOGResources] or [PioneerEnergy Services].O'Reilly:Plus, they don't need the cash, but they have a little   bit of an opening, and they need to raise money.Muckerman:Yeah. So you have [DiamondbackEnergy] raising money to purchase assets in West Texas.Gulfport Energyraised some money to buy assets in Oklahoma. There are   a few other companies out there as well. You look at a record   year for issuances by oil and gas producers: $31.3 billion   in 2016, which is twice as much as you saw in 2015.O'Reilly:That is amazing. What was it in 2014?Muckerman:2014, not off the top of my head.O'Reilly:Still, that's crazy.Muckerman:Yeah. Just in December alone, they raised about --O'Reilly:And this was equity, not debt.Muckerman:Yeah, this was all equity.O'Reilly:That is staggering to me.Muckerman:Some were paying down debt, but most of them, I think, are just   gearing up, not necessarily to immediately drill, but they   think it's about time, so they're padding the wall here.O'Reilly:Yeah, that does seem to be in effect.Muckerman:And it might prove prescient, because right now,   you're looking at expectations that the cost of drilling and   fracking is going to rise about 20% this year, simply   because companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger andBaker Hughesand [Weatherford International], the services companies, gave pricing concessions over the   last couple years to help these drillers maintain a low cost per   barrel to produce, so that they could actually do some   drilling. They're probably going to try and claw that back.   On top of that, higher demand in general, the services   are going to be stretched because of the layoffs that we   talked about. So you're looking at, maybe, up to a 20% increase   in the price of fracking, which could add up to $10 per barrel to   the base cost.O'Reilly:Yeah. Was that a month ago that you first mentioned that? We've   talked about it before.Muckerman:I've had it in my mind for a little while. Yeah, those price   concessions were pretty serious.O'Reilly:They've been nice, but now they want to make money, too.Muckerman:Absolutely. And these producers, they can't acquire the oil and   natural gas without these companies. So they're   the bottleneck, and if they don't get the prices they want,   you know what?O'Reilly:Game over. So, Mr. Muckerman...Muckerman:What?O'Reilly:We're going to go from guys getting oil out of the ground to the   next stage of what might be how the world is powered with energy.   Carbon emissions for 2016, we just found out, are expected to be   the lowest since 1992. What were you doing in 1992, Taylor?Muckerman:Well, let's see. I was 7.O'Reilly:You were playing Power Rangers.Muckerman:Probably playing outside and harnessing the power of the sun   myself. Vitamin D.O'Reilly:I have to think that a lot of this is just because of way more   efficient cars.Muckerman:Efficient cars, yeah, that's big. The switch from coal to natural   gas to generate power in the United States. We saw, this year,   for the first time ever, natural gas overtook coal as the largest   provider of fuel to create electricity. So that's a big thing.   And I think people drove a lot more this year because   gas is so cheap. I don't have the exact specifics on me.O'Reilly:There were statistics. It's a calculation, like, do we fly   or drive? Especially if you have a family of four, it's very   price-dependent. And gas was cheap.Muckerman:When you start keepingVolkswagenhonest, you get down to the bottom of it, and you take all   those older cars off the street that were polluting more   than we thought --O'Reilly:Wait, are you implying that Volkswagen is the reason for   this drop?Muckerman:Quite possibly. Maybe they should be lauded now instead   of...O'Reilly:There were a lot of Volkswagen Jettas included in this,   now that you mention that.Muckerman:Yeah, millions! Globally. I don't know about how many were   impacted in the U.S. But yeah. Big deal.O'Reilly:Also a part of it might be -- and we talked about this   before -- but solar power is on the rise in Texas in 2016.   That's, of course, the other part of this. Also, I don't   know if you saw, fool.com writer Travis Hoium, he recently   wrote a piece about how Las Vegas is entirely green now for their   energy.Muckerman:No kidding?O'Reilly:Yeah. They're in a desert, so it's like, what are you going   to do?Muckerman:So that hockey stadium is going to be completely solar   powered?O'Reilly:Yeah. Isn't that nice? But, same deal in Texas. Desert   land, nothing grows, let's put up some solar   panels.Muckerman:They're catching up to California and Nevada in terms of   solar installations. I think this was the strongest year   ever for them.O'Reilly:It's also fun for them, because there's three power   grids nationally in the United States. There's the   Eastern grid, the Western grid, and Texas.Muckerman:I had no idea.O'Reilly:They have their own power grid.Muckerman:I wonder who negotiated that.O'Reilly:Well, think about the Texas mentality. ""We could have been   our own country if we wanted to.""Muckerman:Could have been. They probably will one day. Who knows? But   yeah, you're looking at 77% of all the solar that was installed   in Q3. Q3 was twice as big as Q2 of 2016, in terms of   installations, and three times as big as Q3 of 2015, so year over   year, three times more in terms of solar power capacity was   installed in Q3. You're looking at great expectations   for Q4. We haven't seen those results out yet. But, about   three-quarters of the Q3 installations were of the utility-scale   variety. So that means you're looking at potential companies likeFirst SolarorSunPowerreally benefiting there.O'Reilly:The price dropped this past year. A lot of the solar stocks   you're talking about just now, their stocks aren't doing that   great because they're having to cut prices because, at the end of   the day, it's a hardware commodity. This is what happened   with computers. If memory serves, the prices of these solar cells   were dropping 10% to 20% last year. This isn't surprising at   all.Muckerman:Yeah, they're down big, and obviously the market is   responding by increasing the demand. You're seeing the   parity start to creep up in terms of it costing the same or   less to use solar power.O'Reilly:So I do need to ask, because it lends itself to what we were   talking about before -- the switch from coal to natural gas   is obviously awesome, lower emissions, etc.   Should natural gas be worried now?Muckerman:Because of solar power and wind power? No, I don't think so.   Right now, you're looking at natural gas being the baseload   provider.O'Reilly:Because you do need it overnight. The sun sets.Muckerman:In terms of aggregate, I'm pretty sure natural gas is --O'Reilly:Here to stay.Muckerman:-- multiples above solar and wind right now. That being   said, they're catching up. You are talking about doubling and   tripling growth quarter over quarter, year over year.   That's pretty meaningful. And I don't really see it slowing   down. If you talk about reduced costs and utility scale, that's   what it's going after.O'Reilly:They're getting efficient, too. The cheap cells are, like, 19%   efficient now. Which, 10 years ago, 10% efficiency was a big   deal. The more expensive super-quality cells are in the   23% efficiency ranges. It's getting good, if you want   to do something like this.Muckerman:And I don't know how many homes there are in the United States,   but enough solar capacity was installed, supposedly, they're   predicting, once they get Q4 numbers.O'Reilly:I think there's 110, 120 million households. I'm talking about   census data. I could be wrong. I don't know how many houses that   is, because you have single people in there, too.Muckerman:Yeah. So, arguably, you have a long way to go. But in 2016 alone,   they estimate that enough was installed to power 2.3 million   homes. That's a pretty decent number.O'Reilly:I was going to guess 1 million. That's high. Wow, cool. Gosh, is   there any way for us to make money off of this?Muckerman:Well, I think we had a podcast sponsor a while back, I think it   was something like a way to invest in --O'Reilly:Oh, Wunder Capital.Muckerman:Wunder Capital, yeah, a way to invest in a portfolio of   solar.O'Reilly:You could also say the solar yieldcos.Muckerman:Or you just look out for solar, SunPower, SolarCity --   well, I guess [Tesla Motors](NASDAQ: TSLA) now, because SolarCity is no longer public.O'Reilly:You have these facilities, and they're used to making solar cells   at certain costs, and they're the older cells now that are being   outmoded, so they're currently switching over to the   higher-efficiency ones. So I think the next year or two for the   solar guys is going to be rough, but long-term, I think if they   can keep up with the efficiencies, they'll be OK.Muckerman:Yeah. And if you want to check out that article Sean mentioned,   it's by Travis Hoium, published in the middle of December, titled   ""U.S. Solar Record Installations: The Future Is Getting Brighter   for Clean Energy,"" and I can't think of anybody better to read   than Travis Hoium if you want to learn about solar.O'Reilly:Yeah, on fool.com, he's our solar guy right now.Muckerman:As long as I've been at the Fool, he's been covering that   industry, not exclusively, but I would place that 75%-85% of his   time is spent on solar.O'Reilly:Yeah, that and harking on Tesla. We love you, Travis.Muckerman:And now Tesla's part of the solar regime with their acquisition   of SolarCity, the Gigafactory is up and running, only around   15%-20% capacity.O'Reilly:Yeah, I got a push notification yesterday, I was like, ""You   didn't tell us, what?""Muckerman:They're producing lithium batteries, and then the Powerwall,   which they're selling --O'Reilly:That's the trick, of course, with solar and wind -- how do you   store this energy, if you don't need it right then?Muckerman:Tesla might be on the way to figuring it out, at least for the   residential side of the business.O'Reilly:Sweet. Well, thank you for your time, Taylor!Muckerman:Thank you!O'Reilly:See you next week!Muckerman:Yes, sir!O'Reilly:Well, that is it for us, folks.

5 Stocks Millennials Should Buy in 2017;1/15/2017;"Millennials have one of the most important things in investing   on their side: time.By starting to invest long before retirement, millennials can   take a very long-term view of their investments. And at The   Motley Fool, a long-term view is what we're all about. With that   in mind, here are five stocks that are attractive for any   millennial's portfolio.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.SquareOne of the broad trends I think we can expect to continue for   decades to come is a growing number of mobile transactions.Square Inc(NYSE: SQ) is a leader in mobile transactions for businesses, and   with Square Cash has become a leader in peer-to-peer transactions   as well.Square is losing money today, but the company is growing like   crazy and margins are starting to improve, as you can see   below.SQ Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsThe great thing about Square is that it's building a business   that will be the foundation on which thousands of other small   businesses will be built. With payment processing, point of sale   solutions, payroll, and other offerings Square is making it   easier to build a business and operate it on mobile platforms,   something millennials probably interact with on a regular   basis.Whole FoodsMillennials didn't start the organic food trend, but they're   taking it to a new level. It isn't necessarily that they want   food to be healthier than other generations have, but how food is   made and what's in it is more important to millennials than ever   before. That's been a big driver ofWhole Foods'(NASDAQ: WFM) success over the past decade, something that I   think will continue as millennials get older and more start   buying their own groceries.It's true that Whole Foods' stock price has dipped over the   past year as growth has slowed and profits sank. But the fall in   the stock price means shares trade at a much more reasonable 20x   earnings than the ratio's peak in the 60s a few years ago.WFMdata byYChartsWhat Whole Foods is riding is a long-term trend toward food   that's more transparent and more humanely produced than previous   generations have demanded. It's no longer the only player in the   market, but it's still the biggest fish, and is uniquely   positioned to become a go-to grocery store for millions of   millennials for decades to come.General MotorsTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) may be the easy auto pick for millennial   investors, butGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) is the better investment long-term. Not only has GM   generated more than twice as much net income over the past year   ($13.9 billion) as Tesla generated in revenue ($5.9 billion) --   in some ways, it's ahead of the EV upstart on technology.GM bought a9% stake in ride sharing company Lyft in 2016and recently bought Cruise Automation to advance its self-driving   car technology as well. So GM is already ahead of Tesla in the   ride sharing business, and is arguably on equal footing in self   driving technology.Where GM has really jumped ahead of competitors is with the   Chevy Bolt. The all-electric EV with a 238 mile range and price   tag under $30,000 (after the federal tax credit) beat Tesla's   Model 3 to the road and will likely have about a year head start   in deliveries.It may be exciting to talk about Tesla as a future power in   the auto industry, but GM is far more established and is   executing on a strategic shift that will make the company   relevant for decades to come. For long-term investors, that's   where I would put my money today.SunPowerIf there's one trend that will change the world more than any   other during the lifetime of millennials, I think it's solar   energy. Fossil fuels have long powered everything from our homes   to our cars, but it's energy from the sun that's actually our   most abundant energy resource, providing the earth with enough   energy every hour to provide all of the world's energy   consumption needs for an entire year.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is the most efficient solar panel manufacturer in   the world, and has exposure to nearly every segment of the solar   market around the world. Everything from small, handheld solar   cells to the largest power plants in the world are powered by   SunPower solar cells, and that gives the company a unique   position from which to grow into the multi-trillion dollar energy   market.What's encouraging for millennials buying now is that the   growth is just beginning. Subsidies no longer drive the adoption   of solar energy, with SunPower winning bids in Chile, Mexico, and   Nevada that provide cost efficient energy more cheaply than   fossil fuels. And with falling costs we will see volumes grow   long-term. This is a volatile market, but if you have a decade or   two to wait, SunPower is well positioned to take advantage of the   booming solar market.NikeConsciousness about health and fitness is almost a standard   among millennials today. Whether it's biking to work or taking   yoga classes, athletic gear is going to be a staple for the   entire generation. AndNike(NYSE: NKE) is a company that's proven to have staying power in   the athletics business.Nike has proven its ability to stay relevant as styles have   changed, but it's their sales model that I think demonstrates why   they're built to last. Sure, you can buy Nike products from most   retailers, but the company is a master at dealing directly with   customers through digital marketing and direct online sales. This   cuts out all middlemen and will lead to more information on what   customers want and higher profits long-term. And as you build   your portfolio, that's a great trend to be following in   retail.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

9 Facts You Didn't Know About Driverless Cars;1/15/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Technology and automotive companies are currently in a sprint   to bring the best (and the safest) self-driving technologies to   market. The companies have been spurred on by high traffic   fatalities, increasing support by governments, and, of course,   new revenue potential.makeArticleAd();The pace at which driverless car technology advances is   astounding, which means that most of us have probably missed a   few key developments if we haven't been keeping up lately. Check   out these nine facts to help bring your driverless car knowledge   back up to speed:Google's Waymo just cut the cost of LIDAR by     90%.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google recently spun out its     self-driving business into its own company, called Waymo, and     this month it announced that it hasreduced the costof the LIDAR technology, which is used to help self-driving     cars see what's around them. According toArsTechnica, Waymo may have reduced the price from $75,000 down to $7,500.2018 is the year to watch.Electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA)  released a video a couple of months ago     showing a person riding around in a Tesla -- in Autopilot mode     -- with the car completely in command. Tesla started adding     fully autonomous hardware to its cars a few months ago and says     it'll actively roll out software updates to bring full autonomy     to its vehicles after they go through more testing. But     CEO Elon Musk has said he wants Tesla to have a fully     autonomous vehicle on the road by 2018.Mars rover technology might find its way into     driverless cars.At the Consumer Electronics Show this month,Nissan Motor Co.(NASDAQOTH: NSANY)announced that it wants to implement NASA technology used for     the Mars rovers to help control fleets of self-driving cars.     Nissan's Seamless Autonomous Mobility (SAM) system allows a     self-driving car to call on a person for help if the car     doesn't know what to do (for example, if it needs to interpret     hand signals from a traffic officer). The vehicle would call     SAM in such a situation, and a person would map out a quick     route around the problem area. Other self-driving cars would     then learn from these situations to improve their own driving     knowledge. NASA used a similar system, called Visual     Environment for Remote Virtual Exploration (VERVE), for the     Mars rover and other vehicles, which involved humans mapping     out routes around obstacles when the rover couldn't figure out     what to do on its own.Driverless cars will make you a better       driver.Chipmaker and driverless car tech leaderNVIDIACorporation(NASDAQ: NVDA)  recently announced its new artificial       intelligence (AI) Co-Pilot system that uses external cameras       and radar to tell you what's around (such as a bicyclist),       and internal cameras that keep track of where you're looking.       The AI Co-Pilot will drive the car by itself most of the       time, but will use its data to also help humans learn how to       drive better when they're controlling the wheel.Self-driving vehicles will be big business.Boston Consulting Group estimates that the driverless car     market will be worth $77 billion by 2035. Not all of that will     come from sales of the vehicles themselves, though. Many     companies, like Waymo, plan on making money from self-driving     ride-hailing services.Not everyone is a fan of the technology.An advocacy group for professional drivers, called the     Upstate Transportation Association, is trying to get New York     toban self-driving carsfor 50 years. The organization wants to protect the jobs of     professional drivers, though a 50-year ban seems a bit extreme     (won't the AI robots have taken over by then?). So far, New     York's state government appears open to self-driving     technologies on its roads. But the state does have a     requirement for drivers to keep one hand on the wheel that     self-driving opponents are hoping can be used to ban the tech.Driverless cars might make traffic worse,     initially.A new study by the U.K. Department for Transport found that     traffic would actuallyget worseon Britain's roads when driverless cars take to the streets,     because the vehicles will be too cautious at first. When a     quarter of all cars are automated, the government agency     expects road delays to tick up by 0.9%, and the percentage     won't go down until about 50% to 75% of all cars are fully     autonomous.There will be slow, but steady, growth.One-quarter of all cars will be autonomous by 2040, according     the Brookings Institution. AndIHSbelieves we'll reach driverless car ubiquity sometime     after 2050.China could lead the autonomous-vehicle     market.China is trying to revamp its trucking industry by     allowing companies to test out self-driving technologies at afaster pacethan many other countries. The lack of regulation in the     country means that China is in a position to roll out     self-driving tech faster, though it raises the question of     whether accelerated development of the technology comes at the     expense of safety.Final thoughtsWhile there are certainly concerns around self-driving cars,   there's virtually no stopping this technology now. Automakers,   tech companies, and governments are all eager to bring autonomous   driving to the masses, and we're likely to see the pace of   innovation pick up over the coming years.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Detroit Auto Show: Why Audi's Q8 Concept SUV Is Significant;1/15/2017;"The Audi Q8 Concept at the North American International Auto   Show in Detroit. Image source: Audi AG.German luxury-car makerAudi AG(NASDAQOTH: AUDVF) unveiled a big new SUV in Detroit this past   Monday. The Audi Q8 Concept is technically just a show car, but   Audi officials said that it's a close preview of an upcoming new   full-size luxury crossover SUV from the German brand.makeArticleAd();But in addition to being a preview of Audi's new flagship   crossover SUV, it's also a preview of something else: The   approach that Audi and its corporate parent will take to get   past the diesel-emissions cheating scandal.What it is: A preview of a new flagship SUV for AudiFirst and foremost, although the Q8 at the North American   International Auto Show in Detroit is officially a ""concept,"" or   show vehicle, Audi officials were clear: Something very much like   it, probably with the Q8 name, will arrive at dealers in   2018.If so, the upcoming new Q8 will be a high-tech luxury   powerhouse with a profile that hints at the classic Audi Quattro   models of the 1980s. Audi describes its shape as ""an elegant   alternative to the robust presence"" of a typical big SUV.It is that. The Q8 Concept is big, with high sides. But   up close it seems well scaled, not enormous -- despite its very   big wheels (23 inches) and tires. Inside, it's spacious, with an   attractive design and Audi's usual top-notch materials and fit   and finish. The Concept's interior features an elaborate series   of touchscreen displays and a heads-up display for the driver;   it's unclear exactly how much of that will make it into the   production model. But much of it might.The Audi Q8 Concept's interior. Image source: Audi AG.The plug-in hybrid drivetrain seems more likely to make it to   production. It combines Audi's 3.0-liter turbo V6 with a   100-kilowatt electric motor for a combined equivalent of 443   horsepower and a beefy 516 pounds-feet of torque, which should   make the Q8 a lively driver. The Concept's 17.9 kilowatt-hour   lithium-ion battery pack is good for an electric-only range of   just over 37 miles, Audi said.""The Q8 concept is an Audi in peak form. It demonstrates the   strengths of our brand in both technology and design while   providing a glimpse at a future full-size, production SUV,"" said   Dietmar Voggenreiter, Audi's chief of sales and marketing. ""With   its next-generation display and control solutions, we are   enabling customers to experience connectivity in a whole new   way.""Why it's important: The Q8 Concept signals Audi's move past   the diesel messAudi, of course, is a subsidiary of German auto giantVolkswagen AG(NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) , which is currently contending with a massive   (and massively costly) scandal after it admitted to programmingmillions of diesel-powered vehiclesto cheat on government emissions tests.Audi hasn't been tainted by the scandal to anything like the   same extent at VW's namesake brand. But like VW, it needs to show   that it willmove past the diesel messinto a (cleaner) future -- and like VW, it plans to do that by   putting a very strong emphasis on electrified drivetrains.Another view of the Audi Q8 Concept on Audi's show stand in   Detroit. Image source: Audi AG.Audi plans tolaunch an all-electric SUV next year. That's expected to provide some serious competition toTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model X. But it's likely to be a niche product,   at least for the near future. Sophisticated plug-in hybrid   drivetrains like the one in the Q8 Concept will be the   mass-market alternative until pure-electric vehicles move more   fully into the automotive mainstream.It's likely that the production Q8 will feature a series of   gasoline engines as well as a plug-in hybrid version. But the   plug-in hybrid as Audi has presented it here is important: Rather   than positioning it primarily as an eco-friendly drivetrain, Audi   talked up its performance.That probably reflects a lesson learned from Tesla: Customers   will line up for electric vehicles (and by extension, plug-in   hybrids) if they're exciting and offer somethingmorethan gasoline-only alternatives. The Q8 Concept signals that Audi   is thinking along those lines for its upcoming flagship SUV.   That's a good sign.10 stocks we like better than Volkswagen AGWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Hawaii Is Becoming the Proving Ground for the Future of Energy Storage;1/14/2017;"The islands of Hawaii are known for their gorgeous landscapes   and world famous beaches, but they're probably not the first   place you think of when you think of renewable energy. But they   should be.Hawaii is the first state in the U.S. where rooftop solar has   become an almost standard item on homes and businesses, something   I personally witnesses recently driving around the islands of   O'ahu and Kaua'i. Solar panels are also in places unthinkable in   other locations. They face north, they're covered by trees, and   some look like they're barely attached to the roof itself. But   Hawaiians find solar to be so economical that almost all solar   makes sense, and they are increasingly finding energy storage an   economical solution as well. Understanding just how energy   storage is working here can help us understand why companies are   proving their technologies of the future on the Hawaiian   Islands.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Island energy doesn't look like continental U.S.     energyOn average, U.S. residential consumers pay 12.45 cents per kWh   for electricity. Prices vary by state in the continental U.S.,   from 9.33 cents per kWh in Louisiana to 19.95 cents per kWh in   Connecticut, but the prices in the lower 48 states pale in   comparison to those in Hawaii.According to the EIA, in October 2016 residential electricity   prices in Hawaii were 27.54 cents per kWh, and on the island of   Kaua'i rates are 32.78 per kWh starting this year. That makes   solar extremely viable given the fact that power purchase   agreements for residential projects can be found for less than   $0.13 per kWh. Utility contracts are going for less than $0.05   per kWh. And the difference means energy storage can make   financial sense as well.Big investments being made on Kaua'iSolarCity andTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) were the first big investors in Kaua'i, building a   13 MW solar plant and 52 MWh battery system. They combined with   24 MW of existing solar power to provide as much as 13 MW of   power to the grid during evening's peak hours of 5 p.m. to 10   p.m. The reported price per kWh of electricity from the   Tesla/SolarCity system was 14.5 cents per kWh.This week, AES Corp announced a deal to build a 28 MW solar   farm with a 100 MWh battery system attached. This time,   electricity will be sold to KIUC for 11 cents per kWh. When   completed, Kaua'i will get over 50% of its electricity from   renewable sources.In less than a year and a half between the Tesla/SolarCity   deal and the AES deal, the cost of solar+storage fell 30%. And it   shouldn't go unnoticed that the price of electricity is now below   the retail rate most consumers pay in the continental U.S. Hawaii   is proving that a 100% renewable energy future is not only   possible, it's closer than you might think.Islands are the new proving groundsSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR)  won a bid to build a similar system in the   French West Indies and Corsica. The company will build 20.7 MW of   solar power plants on the islands and five projects totaling 18.4   MW of solar power that will include energy storage.Islands around the world rely on burning diesel for   electricity, so they're taking notice to the falling cost of   solar+storage.Solar+storage is the next big energy trendSolar energy contracts in the U.S. are now below $0.05 per   kWh, and by the end of 2017 we should see contracts below $0.04   per kWh. So solar energy is competitive with new fossil fuel   plants on a per unit of energy basis. But the intermittency of   renewables is still a challenge, something batteries can help   address.What Kaua'i is showing is that combining solar with energy   storage can create an economical energy combination that can   supply electricity beyond the hours the sun is out.

This Week in Solar;1/13/2017;"Normally, this is the weekly recap where I cover the breaking   news from solar companies around the world, from new project   signings to bankruptcies. But this week, the industry's focus has   been on a much bigger picture: policy and advocacy. From   California to Washington D.C., investors will want to buckle in   for a wild ride in the solar energy space over the next few   years.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();California may make solar mandatoryAt the start of 2017, San Francisco made solar energy   mandatory for all new buildings that are 10 stories or fewer. And   the election of Scott Wiener, the author of that bill, to the   state senate hasbrought the idea to the Capitol. Wiener has brought a summary proposal for legislation that   would take the mandate statewide, which could end up in full   legislative form within a couple of months.Mandating solar on new buildings would be a huge boost for the   solar industry, but it would have an ancillary benefit of being   much cheaper than solar through traditional sales channels. Sales   and marketing costs have proven to be very high for solar because   sales staff often have to visit each home individually.Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity, in particular, has had to lower its   installation guidance multiple times over the past year, and   costs have spiked because sales are becoming more difficult.But knowing that new buildings have to have solar would help   lower sales costs, and having the cost of solar rolled into a   mortgage would lower financing costs, as well. The result should   be a combination of lower costs for solar buyers and/or higher   margins for installers. What companies will want to do next is   partner with builders to efficiently sell their systems, which is   where it's notable thatSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) already has partnerships with seven of the 10   largest homebuilders in the country. That could be an advantage   if the California mandate passes.The solar industry's biggest voice may be President     ObamaSolar energy has grown by leaps and bounds over the last eight   years, increasing from 1.3 GW installed in 2008 to an expected   14.1 GW in 2016. And investors have to keep in mind that   subsidies and policies at the federal, state, and local levels   have helped drive that growth.Along with falling costs, the federal investment tax credit,   state renewable mandates, and policies likePURPAhave helped drive the industry forward. The concern within   the industry is that the new presidential administration and   Congress will tear down some of that support. One of the biggest   supporters of solar energy, President Obama, happens to be in the   White House for a few more days, and he recently made a   compelling case for more investment in the future in aSciencearticle titled, ""The irreversible momentum of clean energy,"" saying in part:This should not be a partisan issue. It is good business and     good economics to lead a technological revolution and define     market trends. And it is smart planning to set long-term     emission-reduction targets and give American companies,     entrepreneurs, and investors certainty so they can invest [in]     and manufacture the emission-reducing technologies that we can     use domestically and export to the rest of the world.Policy matters in the solar industry, and to maintain   favorable policies that will drive future growth, the industry   needs to have a positive message to sell to all Americans.   President Obama may emerge as the loudest voice for the industry,   and the message he outlined above is as good as anyone can ask   for, no matter which way you lean politically.The biggest rooftop solar system in the worldTesla's Gigafactory will break a lot of records, but one   important one will be the fact that it's expected to install the   biggest rooftop solar system in the world, at 70 MW. That's about   seven times the second-largest array anywhere else in the   world.If the plant is going to get 100% of its energy from renewable   energy, the roof is a good place to start. This also likely will   be a proving ground for SolarCity's solar panels that will be   produced in Buffalo, New York.Tesla is certainly putting its money where its mouth is when   it comes to renewable energy. And powering what will eventually   be the biggest factory in the world with renewable energy is a   big endorsement of Tesla's overall vision of the future. Solar   energy is literally going to help keep the lights on.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Don’t Sweat Analysts’ Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factory;1/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this week,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) finally put its ballyhooed gigafactory into motion, beginning the production oflithium-ion batteries in Sparks, Nevadain front of a crowd of a few hundred interested parties. TSLA stock soared on the heels of the event, of course, jumping nearly 5% the day it officially flipped the switch to ""on,"" and then continued to rally. Indeed, Tesla stock has rallied 27% since early November, mostly in anticipation of the milestone event.Source: ShutterstockAnd yet, while the market and most retail investors were clearly impressed, more than a handful of analysts weren't. Their concerns?makeArticleAd();A lack of fiscal details about how the battery plant will impact the company's books, for one. Another worry was about the sheer cost of the facility itself. Still another was whether the Model 3 may not be profitable when it finally goes into production.With all due respect to those professionals, you want to start worrying about these things now?Now?!?Yes. No. Maybe.Just for the record, yes, I'm the same guy who's been more critical than constructive on Tesla Motors over the years (likehere,hereandhere).7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     BankBut, my pessimism was never to suggest that Tesla's take on electric vehicles wasn't game-changing. The companyhasmainstreamed EVs. Its carsareengineering marvels. My concerns were simply rooted in the notion that most investors had unrealistic expectations; the masses couldn't distinguish between Tesla Motors being a trade or an investment.In retrospect, it's not clear if the analyst community was able to distinguish between the two either.Take the comments from Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino as an example.He said, following Tuesday's event at the facility:""Overall we found the tour helpful in illustrating the layout and process for manufacturing lithium ion battery cells and packs for its automotive and energy products. However, there was a lack of quantitative updates for 2017 and the ramp expectations.""Fair enough. Just bear in mind, however, that Goldmanupgraded Tesla stock to a ""buy"" in May of last year- when the battery factory was well underway - with analyst Patrick Archambault commenting ""We do not believe Tesla shares are fully capturing the company's disruptive potential.""So … is Tesla any less disruptive now that it's making its own batteries en masse? The stock isn't any higher now than it was then, but Goldman's current rating on TSLA is ""neutral.""Granted, Goldman was just days away from underwriting another secondary offering of TSLA stock in May but the company didn't know anylessabout the math of the gigafactory than it knows now. The only real difference between then and now is the stock's price.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas was also worried about Tesla's lack of fiscal details now that the factory is in production, just as much as he's worried that another round of fundraising is in the cards. Again, however, that's nothing new for Tesla Motors, and it wasn't a problem for Jonas back in 2014 when he doubled Morgan Stanley's price target on TSLA stock, to $320 per share.He notedat the time:""If it can be a leader in commercializing battery packs, investors may never look at Tesla the same way again … Tesla says it will team up with partners to build the world's largest Li-ion battery pack facility in the US. We reflect the potential for lower battery costs through higher sales volume nearly doubling Tesla's share of the global car market to 90bps by 2028, driving our target increase.""Teslaisclearly going to have that ""world's largest Li-ion battery pack facility"" Jonas was stoked about three years ago. And, there's at least alittlemore clarity now than there was then. Yet, Morgan Stanley's current rating on Tesla stock is a modest ""equal weight"" despite clear progress being made since the 2014 call that said such progress would be compelling.The stock never even threatened to reach $320.And that's when it hits you … some (though not all) analysts are just taking their best guess on TSLA, beingled bythe rhetoric rather thanleadingthe rhetoric.To be fair, that's what analyst do.And it's not easy.Opinions should be updated as new information surfaces.On the other hand, the ebb and flow between quantitative and qualitative analysis from some analysts has made it tough for investors to digest those professional insights. The things that didn't matter before - like profits or perpetual fund-raising - can't be too big of a deal for the stock now.Here's Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Dominated     Holiday SalesIn other words, don't sweat the naysayers' opinions too much.Bottom Line for TSLA StockNone of this is to suggest TSLA is inevitably going to skyrocket higher, nor is it to imply Tesla stock is doomed; the actual outcome is apt to be somewhere in between the two extreme opinions. It's simply to point out that of all the reasons you may want to worry about owning Tesla shares, the lackluster response from analysts regarding the gigafactory is the least of them. Those guys are largely expected to say something in response to milestone events, and many of the pessimistic comments were off-the-cuff sound bites not meant to be taken as a complete analysis.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print     Money7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017The postDon't Sweat Analysts' Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factoryappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Motors, Inc.'s Supercharger Network Is Still Mostly Free;1/13/2017;"In a blog post Thursday evening,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) revealed the latest details on its plans to charge   new Tesla owners some small fees for Supercharger usage. As it   turns out, however, most charging will still be free. Here's the   latest on Tesla's evolving Supercharger program ahead of its   higher-volume Model 3 launch later this year.Tesla Supercharger. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Necessary changesAs Tesla pointed out in its Thursday blog post, ""Building a   charging network that provides quick, convenient, and   long-distance travel is critical to the adoption of electric   vehicles."" And this is why the company has been both rapidly   expanding its Supercharger locations and introducing some fees   and policies aimed to relieve congestion at crowded locations.   With Model 3 planned to launch this year and expected to be   produced at much higher volumes than its pricier Model S and   Model X vehicles, the Supercharger network will need to be ready   to handle demand from a fast-growing fleet of vehicles.Tesla started initiating changes to the Supercharger program   in November, when the electric-car maker said it would soon begin   charging new vehicles for Supercharger use beyond 400 kWh per   year. Then, in December, Tesla introduced afeefor vehicles plugged in at Supercharger locations but no longer   charging.Now Tesla is unveiling the details of the new fee structures   as it begins to deliver the first Tesla vehicles that no longer   qualify for free lifetime access to unlimited charging for   long-distance travel.In short, new Tesla customers will have to pay per kWh of   charging after using 400 kWh of free Supercharging credits in any   given year. Charging for use by the kWh is ""the fairest way"" for   owners to pay for the exact energy they use, Tesla says. But in   some regions, Tesla will bill users per minute of charge because   of local regulations prohibiting the sale of electricity on a per   kWh basis. However, Tesla says it is ""actively working with   regulators to update the rules.""Prices range from state to state, but they remain well below   the price of gasoline. Tesla gave some examples of how much   charging could cost:To put the affordability of Supercharging into perspective,     customers will pay about $15 for a road trip from San     Francisco to Los Angeles, about $120 from Los Angeles     to New York, about 60 euros from Paris to Rome, and about 400     yuan from Beijing to Shanghai.Tesla also promised that Supercharging will always be   ""significantly cheaper than gasoline.""Furthermore, Tesla ensured customers that they won't have to   get out their credit cards or cash to pay when accessing   Superchargers. Instead, Tesla owners will be billed automatically   to credit cards linked to their website account. And customers   can view Supercharger history and invoices online anytime.The goal for Tesla's new Supercharger fees, the company   emphasized, isn't to make a profit, but rather to ""recover a   portion of our costs and set up a fair system for everyone; this   will never be a profit center for Tesla.""Tesla's plan for U.S. Supercharger locations by the end of   2017. Image source: Tesla Motors.Still free (kind of)But what's perhaps most intriguing about Tesla's approach to   monetizing the network is that it still clearly aims to offer   enough free charging for most owners to rarely -- if ever -- have   to pay.Since owners charge at home for local driving and the   Supercharger network is only meant for long-distance travel in   the first place, 400 kWh (roughly 1,000 miles) turns out to be   sufficient for most drivers' annual long-distance Supercharger   usage, according to Tesla.Image source: The Motley Fool.We carefully considered current Supercharger usage and found     that 400 kWh covers the annual long-distance driving needs of     the majority of our owners. As a result, most owners will     continue to enjoy the benefits of Supercharging on road trips     at no additional cost.Ahead of Tesla's planned Model 3 launch later this year, the   company will likely continue to make changes to its Supercharger   network, primarily by continuing to expand it. Last year, Tesla   said it planned to double its Supercharger stations around the   world by the end of 2017, increasing them from 3,600 to 7,200.   The network has already expanded rapidly, with stations now   numbering 5,085.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla (TSLA) Provides Details on Supercharger Fee Structure;1/13/2017;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAdisclosed the details of its plans to charge new customers for the use of its Supercharger network. While the company has traditionally offered free use of the charging network to customers, owners of Model S and Model X cars ordered after Jan 15, 2017 will have to pay a small fee if they use the network beyond a certain limit.Tesla is implementing this strategy to facilitate faster expansion of the Supercharger network and reduce congestion at the charging locations. The company will offer 400 kWh of free Supercharging credits to new customers every year. Tesla believes that this is enough to cover the long-distance travel needs of most of its customers, based on the analysis of their current Supercharger usage. Unused credits, however, will not be rolled over at a year end but will be reset to 400kWh.Beyond the free credits, customers will be charged for every kWh of energy used. However, in certain regions, they will be charged on the basis of the time of usage due to local regulations.Prices will be fixed within each state or province in North America and within each country for foreign locations. To give an estimate of the pricing, Tesla revealed that the journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles will cost about $15, while that from Los Angeles to New York will cost around $120. Meanwhile, a trip from Paris to Rome will cost nearly €60 ($63.74) and that from Beijing to Shanghai will be charged at ¥400 ($3.49).Tesla is developing a network of Superchargers in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. These Superchargers are industrial-grade, high-speed chargers that can revive 50% of the battery of a Model S in 20 minutes and provide full charge in 75 minutes, compared to normal charging stations that take as much as 9 hours for a full charge.At the end of the third quarter of 2016, Tesla had 715 Supercharger locations globally, with 4,461 individual chargers. While 97% and 86% of the population of the continental U.S. and Western Europe, respectively, were within 150 miles of a Supercharger by then, the company aims to reach similar coverage levels for high-population areas in China, Japan and Australia. To supplement the Superchargers, 3,222 destination chargers with 5,547 connection points were available globally at the end of the third quarter. These chargers offer easy charging at hotels, malls as well as restaurants.Price MovementTesla has been underperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry over the last one-year period.

5 Ways To Position For 2017’s Biggest Tech Trends;1/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsWe are in the midst of the greatest technological revolution   of all time. After years in its nascent stages, the internet has   become a critical fixture in all aspects of our lives. High-tech   turning high-touch, to borrow a phrase from futurist John   Naisbitt, has become our reality. All one needs to do is visit   any big box electronics store to see shelves full of all the   internet-connected devices designed to help make our lives   easier.Investors who ride this internet of things (IoT) wave are   poised to reap handsome profits over the long run. The key to   success is identifying sub-trends within the overall trend then   drilling down further into the leading firms within each.makeArticleAd();The following five trends are where smart investors are   putting their money this year.Talking SpeakersI was fortunate enough to receive theAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) Echo as a Christmas gift. Though I first believed that this   ""talking speaker"" named Alexa was nothing more than a gimmick, I   soon discovered otherwise. The voice recognition is uncannily   accurate, and can be used to access dozens of apps for a wide   variety of tasks. Echo also provides an unbelievable music   listening experience despite the small size of the speaker.Currently, I am using Amazon Echo to play music, adjust the   temperature in my home, turn on and adjust the TV, and even get   stock quotes, all by simply using my voice. Among the things I   want to try soon are the voice grocery and Amazon ordering   features. I firmly think that this device is the start of total   voice automation of nearly everything.Soon all home appliance makers will be including technology to   interface with the Echo and other voice command products. At the   same time,Microsoft Corporation's(MSFT) Cortana andAlphabet Inc's(GOOGL) Home have arisen as competitors.At this point, however, there's no question that Amazon   currently has upper hand over the competitors in early acceptance   and infrastructural capabilities.Mobile VideoFacebook, Instagram, and Twitter are all vying to be the   leading live mobile video platform. Soon-to-go-public Snapchat is   hot on their heels with over 10 billion video views daily. We see   more and more primetime news coverage using these live feeds from   regular people. This trend is only getting stronger and the   sector more competitive as time goes by.On the back of this explosion, mobile data providers have been   forced to up their data plans for smartphones across the board.T-Mobile (Nasdaq:TMUS)andSprint (NYSE:S)are both keeping ahead of the curve by offering unlimited data   plans at reasonable prices to accommodate the massive increase in   data usage.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksDue to the uncertain and highly competitive nature of the   mobile video, my picks are Sprint and T-Mobile as the best stocks   to buy to ride this trend. No matter who wins the war, everyone   needs the backbone of mobile data to operate.Augmented RealityThis is perhaps the most science fiction-sounding of all the   major trends for 2017. Augmented reality is a live view of a   physical, real-world environment whose elements are supplemented   by computer-generated sensory input such as maps, video, or   sound. The first large-scale commercial attempt to capture this   trend was Google Glass. These glasses projected a computer screen   near your eye but were too rudimentary to catch on with the   public despite the massive amount of Google-promoted hype.The latest attempts at augmented reality were the Pokemon Go   game and Snap Spectacles. While both have gained a cult   following, it is way too early to determine if either will be a   long-term success. Several of my venture capital friends are   focusing on the idea before the companies going public.One of the most exciting startups, and one getting tremendous   attention and funding, is Magic Leap. I have been fortunate   enough to witness some of their technology, and it may be   world-changing. Keep a close eye on this company!Despite Microsoft coming to market with their HoloLens and   Google working on improving Glass, I do not think the trend is   ready yet for most investors' portfolios.

Sunrun Finds Big-Name Partner in National Grid;1/12/2017;"Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) has had a difficult time differentiating itself in   the competitive rooftop solar market, so it's taking a new   approach. The company announced a new partnership withNational Grid plc(NYSE: NGG) on Tuesday, which will attempt to leverage the   utility's customer base and infrastructure backbone.There's no guarantee that the partnership will pay dividends   for either company, but it's a novel approach to growing sales in   residential solar today.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Why Sunrun and National Grid are teaming upNational Grid will initially team up to sell rooftop solar   systems. Sunrun will be able to target the utility's 100,000   customers in single-family homes in New York with the hopes of   quickly accessing the market. Similar partnerships have been   tried before, notably bySunPowerandTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity partnering withAirbnbandHome Depot. They haven't been particularly noticeable in earnings, but   being able to reach thousands of customers with a utility's help   has maintained allure for solar installers.More notably, the partnership also entails National Grid   committing $100 million to fund equity in 200 MW of solar   projects across the country. This is beyond the tax equity or   other funding Sunrun normally gets and allows the company to   monetize assets earlier than in the past.While partnering with National Grid could be an incremental   positive for Sunrun's normal operations, and vice versa, the real   partnership will be beyond solar system sales.Where the partnership could help Sunrun long     termWhat's interesting about the partnership is that it includes a   deal to look into how to create a network of distributed assets,   including solar and storage, that would provide value to the   grid. The press releasestated it like this:National Grid will also leverage its experience in complex     energy markets to better understand the transformation     occurring in the sector, and will work with Sunrun to explore     options of how distributed energy resources might be aggregated     and used to help keep the energy grid balanced and optimized.     Currently these services are typically provided by centralized     generators.The concept of distributed assets being aggregated into a   series of assets that work together is the goal of many solar   companies. SolarCity's grid service solution aims to provide a   series of benefits to the grid through distributed solar and   energy storage assets. The company also worked with SunPower, Con   Ed, and National Grid to offer a proposal that would compensate   distributed assets based on local value to the grid rather than   net metering. Sunrun is now going to be working on building a   similar aggregated asset base using distributed resources it   controls.This is another example of utilities and solar companies   working together to find ways to provide compensation to   customers and value to the grid for solar and energy storage. If   Sunrun and National Grid can find a way to aggregate assets   together in a group and sell services from those assets, it could   create more value for all parts of the value chain. And that's a   positive trend for both the solar and utility industries.10 stocks we like better than SunrunWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory to Feature World’s Largest Solar Rooftop;1/12/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is planning to have the world's largest solar rooftop on its upcoming gigafactory.makeArticleAd();Source: ©iStock.com/ChenRobertTesla Motors Inc is planning to have a 70 MW solar rooftop on its gigafactory. The current largest solar rooftop in the world is located in India. It is 11.5 MW. The car company is planning to power the factory entirely off of renewable energy.Tesla Motors Inc will also have a solar ground installations that will also help power the factory. These recent statements fall in line with previously-announced plans to have the gigafactory powered by sustainable energy and not fossil fuels.The information about the solar rooftop on the upcoming gigafactory comes from a handout that was given to TSLA investors during a tour of the facility last week. This document was obtained byElectrek.""The GF1, engineered as a singular product, is designed as a highly automated, integrated system intended to be replicated at other locations around the world,"" the handout for investors reads. ""The facility is highly flexible to accommodate improvements in energy storage chemistries and packaging configurations, with limited stranded asset risk.""Tesla Motors Inc will likely be using solar panels for its gigafactory rooftop that are provided by SolarCity. It acquired the solar company late in 2017. The electric car company will store extra energy from the solar panels in Tesla Powerpack. It can then choose to use this energy at a later time, reportsThe Verge.Tesla Motors Inc will also be using waste from production to heat the facility and a closed-loop water system.

"Tesla: Increasing Capacity at Supercharger Locations Now a ""Top Priority""";1/11/2017;"Ahead of its plans to bring to market a lower-cost,   higher-volume electric car before the end of the year,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has been aggressively revamping its Supercharger   network in anticipation of higher demand for the charging   locations. Now the company's latest move for its Superchargers is   to add more charging stalls to existing locations.Tesla Supercharger. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Increasing capacity at Supercharger locationsWhen someone asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk onTwitterTuesday whether he had any plans to increase the number of   charging stalls at Supercharger locations, Musk tweeted back   saying, ""Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations   now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is   empty.""This top priority item adds to Tesla's growing efforts   recently to reduce congestion at Supercharger locations,   particularly in California, where there is a much higher density   of Tesla ownership compared to other areas of the U.S. In   November, Teslaannouncedthat owners after Jan. 1 (the deadline was later extended by two   weeks) would only get about 400 kilowatt-hours (roughly 1,000   miles) of free charging for long-distance travel per year. Beyond   1,000 miles, Tesla owners would be billed a small fee for   incremental charging. In December, it introduced anidling feefor vehicles plugged in at a Supercharger location but no longer   charging.Tesla's active U.S. Supercharger locations. Image source:   Tesla Motors.Of course, Tesla's efforts to expand its Supercharger network   aren't new. When Tesla first announced Model 3, the company said   it planned to double Supercharger stations around the world by   2017, increasing them from 3,600 when the Model 3 was unveiled to   7,200. Today, Tesla already has 5,045 Superchargers at 790   different locations. But with adding Supercharging stalls   currently a ""top priority"" for Tesla, it's likely the company's   rollout of additional stalls at congested Supercharging locations   will take place at a more aggressive rate in the coming   months.Necessary for Model 3As Tesla's planned launch target for Model 3 in the second   half of 2017 approaches, it's increasingly important for Tesla to   improve the Supercharging experience.Tesla expects the higher-volume Model 3 to significantly   increase the size of its fleet. After garnering 373,000   deposit-backed reservations in just a month and a half after the   Model 3's unveiling last March, the company set an aggressive   target of expanding annual production from around 50,000 vehicles   in 2015 to 500,000 vehicles in 2018, driven primarily by Model 3,   of course.Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Currently, Tesla is only producing about 100,000 vehicles per   year. So, if it really can achieve an annualized rate of   production of 500,000 units as early as 2018, the number of Tesla   vehicles requiring a Supercharger while traveling long distance   is about to increase significantly.Tesla has said the Model 3 will come standard with the   hardware for Supercharging capability, but the company hasn't   specified whether the vehicle will also include about 1,000 miles   of free charging per year. Either way, Model 3 owners will need   to charge when traveling long distance -- free or not.As Tesla's planned Model 3 launch approaches, expect the   company to continue expanding and updating its Supercharger   program.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

So far TSLA stock is off to a strong start. And after checking the rear view mirror, there's definite reasons for bullish investors to hop on board with a bull call spread for a drive higher.Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)Tesla.

And when competition fromother auto manufacturersenter the EV market in force - that will spell certain calamity for TSLA stock!Some of Tesla's 40% bearish short interest may also be muttering that Tesla will delay its Model 3 rollout which, because of its lower $35K price point, is supposed to compete head-to-head against the Bolt. Watch out TSLA bulls!There's also ominous chatter that Tesla will undoubtedly announce another secondary, or TSLA stock is burning cash and, and, and … and the list of bearish warnings is nonstop.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryNevertheless, TSLA is also up over 6% in just the second week of 2017 and shaking off some of those concerns for Tesla's 'cult' of bullish investors.It might also be pointed out Tesla has over 400,000 Model 3 sedan preorders and is sold out until mid-2018. Tesla, as an analyst from Baird recently noted, may also have an ace in its pocket with itsenergy storage business.The cult of TSLA is sounding a bit more grounded, yes?Lastly, TSLA continues to look like it wants to motor north in 2017.Tesla Stock Weekly ChartAs noted above, it has been a good start to 2017 for TSLA. Shares are up about 6% and demonstrating relative strength versus averages like theNASDAQ CompositeandS&P 500with gains of around 2.7% and 1.1% respectively.It's our view Tesla shares will continue to motor ahead as well. It's apoint of viewdiscussed just over a week ago.Technically, after nearly three years of volatile, but mostly stalled and lateral price action, TSLA is due to make a meaningful move in 2017. With its early out-the-gate gains, shares of Tesla have also reclaimed and tested the 200-day simple moving average for support and broken out to fresh 4-month highs.Net, net Tesla looks good overall. Of course, that's not to say it's all puppy dogs and rainbows for the cult of TSLA bulls. The provided weekly chart of TSLA suggests shares still face overhead resistance from congestion and a trend line or two. And on this time frame, Tesla is overbought based on its stochastics.TSLA Bull Call SpreadLast week's discussed March $230/$250 bull call vertical notched intraday gains in excess of 50% or $2.50 in profit during yesterday's session and definitely worthy of adjusting. Having said that and after reviewing the board for fresh ideas, I still like this spread as a way to ride TSLA higher.Trade JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Stock for     Earnings RichesCurrently and with TSLA at $228.40, the vertical is priced for $6.95. The spread stands to gain $13.65 or 215% if shares of Tesla can rally 9.5% and through $250 into March expiration.As stressed last time though, our preference is to either exit or adjust the position during the life of the position as TSLA begins to move up or down - and either validating or wrecking our bullish position on the name.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock Not Worth Investing In;1/11/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe saga ofWhole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) has been rather unexpected, to be honest. For many years, I believed WFM to be the category killer for organic food. WFM had everything going for it: brand name, decent footprint, secular tailwinds and solid financials.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Then something happened that I really did not expect, and it blew my conception about WFM out of the water.The thing about category killers is that they are massive one-stop shops for what are effectively commodities.Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) wiped out the local hardware store because it carries everything at lower prices, which it can obtain via economies of scale.WFM, however, is not quite the same concept. At first, and up until recently, it was moving in that direction by openingde novostores and by rolling up small organic grocery stores. The key point, however, is that WFM was not selling commoditized products. It was selling specialized products, which meant it was building itself into the primary supplier of those products - organic and ""responsible"" food.WFM Stock StumblesHowever, in the past couple of years, everyone has gotten into the organics game. Grocers of every stripe,Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT), and even the dollar stores started selling organics.10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help ItOriginally, I thought that this would not present any real competition to WFM. My faulty assumption was that the Whole Foods shopper was loyal to Whole Foods, and had no reason to shop anywhere else. WFM patrons fit a certain upscale demographic.Where I went wrong was that organics have effectivelybecomecommoditized. You can find organic chicken and meat and vegetable and fruit in just about any large grocery store. It doesn't matter if it is ""lower quality"" organic or not compared to WFM. The point is that labeling something ""organic"" is evidence enough to the general consumer.With organics now commoditized, the Whole Foods shopper no longer has loyalty, as we would expect of a commodity business. Thus, consumers have bailed on the substantially higher prices of Whole Foods and deign to visit the regular grocery stores more often. The result has led to lower same-store sales, and other struggles for WFM stock.Costs have also gotten more painful for Whole Foods stock. Even though revenue rose almost 11% from fiscal year 2014 to FY16, operating income fell from $934 million to $857 million, a nearly 300-basis-point drop in gross margins. Net income fell from $579 million to $507 million, with margins declining almost 200 bps.The good news is that both operating and free cash flow have remained relatively unchanged, at about $1.1 billion and $800 million, respectively. However, the company raised a billion dollars in debt in early 2016, for the worst of all possible reasons: to repurchase shares. I hate this. I absolutely hate it.Instead of figuring out how to grow the business and find traction, Whole Foods is buying WFM stock that is trading at 19.7x FY16 earnings while net income is stagnant or falling. WFM thus goes from a company with no long-term debt to one with a billion dollars in debt, paying 5% interest and stealing about 10% of profits to service debt.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Risky, Pricey and Absolutely RightThat's why I don't think you should invest in Whole Foods stock. It's no longer an investment with a clear, long-term vision provided by management.So you trade it. If you look at the one-year chart, you'll see WFM stock has been in a trading range between $28 and $35. I would say to buy it under $30 and flip it above $33 to be safe. For more aggressive traders, you could short it above $33 and cover under $30. In both cases, however, set a 5%-7% stop loss.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Although Tesla never achieved his dream of providing free energy, his groundbreaking work set the stage for today's technologies.makeArticleAd();Indeed, while Wall Street has clamored over Tesla stock in recent years, many would be surprised to learn that TSLA did not invent the electric vehicle. In fact, the very first EV was developed well before TSLA CEO Elon Musk - or even his parents - were born. The firstcrude prototypeswere introduced during the early nineteenth century. However, it wasn't until the 1890s that the EV entered its original heyday.The Backdrop of Tesla stockIn 1893, electric-powered cars were exhibited in Chicago. Four years later, electric taxis were ferrying people around busy New York City streets. By the dawn of the twentieth century, EVs were actually on the verge of automotive domination. In 1900, a whopping 28% of automobiles were powered by electricity. A year earlier, Thomas Edison ofGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) fame began a massive investment into EV battery technologies.Of course, it was Henry Ford and the eventualFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) that killed the EV's momentum. Mass production of the iconic Model T offered the public practical transportation at a substantial discount to its electric counterparts. As further advancements made gasoline-powered cars increasingly convenient, the EV platform was quickly abandoned, and not to be revisited seriously until TSLA entered the scene.4 Casino Stocks to Buy on Japan's     LegalizationThe eventual success of Tesla stock resulted from a primary vulnerability of fossil-fueled autos - dependence on crude oil.

And it's absolutely no conspiracy to say that much of our foreign policy is centered on ""black gold.""I'm not suggesting that Tesla stock is some kind of philanthropic investment. Rather, TSLA is an investment in the future that has been a long-time coming. Anybody that's anybody -Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) - are all gearing up aggressively for digitization and ""next-gen"" computing. To assume that our transportation mechanisms will continue to be tethered to archaic fossil fuels is to believe in the flat earth.I would go so far as to say that the bear case for Tesla stock should only be limited to a clearly defined framework. Otherwise, TSLA is one of the few investments I confidently trust.Fears Surrounding Tesla's ViabilityThat's not to say that Tesla isn't without faults. From a gut reaction, shares are pricey. After all, Tesla stock was trading for around $30 a pop four years ago. At well over $200 today, that's a big percentage and psychological jump. Naturally, investors will question whether they've missed the boat.Click to EnlargeDrawing up a long-term technical chart of Tesla stock does not help matters. When assessing the publicly traded history of TSLA stock, you can't help but notice a sharp resemblance to thebusiness S-curve.In short, the S-curve is a graphical representation of the three main phases of a business or industry - infancy, expansion and maturity. The concern here is that Tesla stock has gone through an accelerated version of the S-curve, and is now sitting in the maturity phase.Adding to those fears are the financials. Let's be honest - they don't look great. Free cash flow is always running in the red, profitability margins are stressed and Tesla stock is overvalued against forward earnings.Short interestfor TSLA stock has also increased significantly since the second-half of this year.Finally, as awesome as these folks are, they're not immune to makingdumb mistakes. The buyout of SolarCityis an embarrassing example.Moving Forward With Tesla StockListen - Tesla stock isn't for everybody. But I'd like to leave you with this last statistic. Presently, everyone is talking about the EV revolution - which TSLA helped catapult - as if it's unprecedented. Yet themarket penetrationfor EVs is only 3%. The mass excitement centers around forecasts calling for 7% penetration by the year 2020.That's nice, but that's just scratching the surface. Assuming the forecast is accurate, that's only a quarter of what was achieved in 1900. With technology advancing at a clip rate, it's more likely than not that TSLA will end up on the right side of history.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in     2017The bottom line here is to not let the bumps in the road dissuade you from Tesla stock. It's risky, it's pricey, but it has all the right components working in its favor.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Biotech Stocks That Are Catching Fire7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead     Weight Right NowThe postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Risky, Pricey and Absolutely Rightappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Expedia, Rexnord, NVIDIA, Daimler AG and Tesla Motors highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;1/11/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 11, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsExpedia, Inc.(NASDAQ:EXPE-Free Report) as the Bull of the DayRexnord Corporation(NYSE:RXN-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onNVIDIA(NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report),Daimler AG(OTCMKTS:DDAIF-Free Report) andTesla Motors(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Expedia, Inc.(NASDAQ:EXPE-Free Report) continues to cash in on strong demand for travel and one-stop online travel buying. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see double digit earnings growth again in 2017.Expedia is the world's largest online travel company encompassing many brands including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Orbitz Worldwide, trivago, HomeAway, Egencia, Travelocity, Hotwire.com, Wotif Group, Classic Vacations, CarRentals.com, Venere, Expedia CruiseShipCenters and AirAsia Expedia.makeArticleAd();Expedia acquired Orbitz in September 2015 and HomeAway in December 2015.Big Growth in Q3 of 2016On Oct 27, Expedia reported third quarter results and met the Zacks Consensus of $2.24.Gross bookings rose 21% to $18.6 billion while revenue increased 33% to $2.6 billion from the 2015 quarter.It had other strong growth metrics including a 17% year-over-year increase in room nights stayed, with growth of 11% if you exclude Orbitz Worldwide.It gained 14,000 properties during the quarter to 321,000 worldwide.Expansion on Amazon AlexaExpedia has been pushing the boundaries in terms of how to get services to customers for some time.On Nov 30, 2016, it announced travelers could ask Amazon's Alexa devices such as the Echo and Echo Dot to give it travel updates on hotels, real-time flight status and updates on gate changes and delays, book or confirm car reservations and more.Bear of the Day:Rexnord Corporation(NYSE:RXN-Free Report) is an industrial company that is still seeing declining earnings. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see a double digit earnings decline in fiscal 2017.Rexnord is an industrial manufacturer in two areas: Process & Motion Control and Water Management. It makes engineered drive systems, seals, couplings and conveyor systems which you would find in the mining, energy and food & beverage industries. It also makes valves, fittings, faucets and drains for the construction industry and municipalities.Rexnord is headquartered in Milwaukee and has 8,000 employees worldwide.Moving Some Jobs to MexicoIf Rexnord sounds familiar to you, that's because it was recently in the news because it decided to close a bearings-making plant in Indianapolis that employed 300 workers and move the business to Mexico. The plant was located just a mile from the Carrier plant which was the subject of tweets in 2016 by Donald Trump.But these jobs, apparently, won't be saved.In December 2016, the union and the company reached a severance agreement which will pay $2,000 plus one week of salary for every year they spent at the company. Workers will also get free health insurance for 6 months.A Public Offering to Raise CashAfter the election results, shares of Rexnord moved sharply higher as investors bought up all the industrial names they thought could benefit from Republican policies.Rexnord decided to take advantage of this move. On Dec 1, Rexnord announced the pricing of a public offering of 7 million shares.The company raised $390.1 million which it intends to use to pay a portion of its outstanding term loan indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.Lowered Full Year GuidanceOn Nov 2, Rexnord reported fiscal second quarter results and met on the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.38.Net sales were only up 1% year over year to $491 million. Core sales fell 2%.It described the demand environment as ""challenging.""Rexnord lowered its fiscal year 2017 EPS to a range of $1.32 to $1.38 due to ongoing deceleration of project schedules in the Middle East water infrastructure markets and a more conservative outlook for growth in the nonresidential construction and process industry end markets.As a result, the analysts have been cutting estimates.4 were cut for fiscal 2017 in the last 60 days which pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $1.32 from $1.52 in the last 3 months.One analyst, however, recently got a bit more bullish and actually raised the estimate in the last week. But that wasn't enough to change the consensus estimate.Analysts still see a 10.4% earnings decline in fiscal 2017.Additional content:NVIDIA, Mercedes-Benz Building A.I.-Powered Self-Driving     CarsOn Tuesday, leading smartphone chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report) and Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler AG (OTCMKTS:DDAIF-Free Report) have announced a partnership to build self-driving cars powered by artificial intelligence (AI).Expected to hit the market within the next year, the cars will feature self-driving capabilities, and an active driver assistance function called ""Co-Pilot."" Co-Pilot looks to be similar to Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) Autopilot, the company's semi-autonomous driving system.Autopilot-enabled vehicles keep the cars in-lane, adjust speed in accordance with other cars on the road, change lanes autonomously, scan for parking spaces, and even self-park. Co-Pilot, however, has the potential to be even more sophisticated.Speaking at the recent 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), NVIDIA founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and Mercedes-Benz Vice President of Digital Vehicle and Mobility Sajjad KhanbelieveAI is going to ""revolutionize"" automobiles going forward.""At this point it is very clear that AI is going to be the future of computing. This is an endeavor that we started three years ago that we will put on the road next year - unbelievable,"" Jen-Hsun said.Mercedes-Benz is not NVIDIA's first self-driving car collaboration. The company partnered with Tesla last year, and all Tesla models-Model S, Model X, and the Model 3, are equipped with an NVIDIA-powered on-board ""supercomputer"" that can provide full self-driving capability.NVIDIA also showed off two other self-driving cars at CES 2017: a Lincoln MKZ retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors, and an Audi Q7, which is equipped with the company's DRIVE PX 2 in-car computer. DRIVE learns by observing the action of human drivers, and the vehicles were ""trained"" in Vegas on only four days of driving before debuting at CES.For more information on self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, check out these Zacks articles:Your Ultimate Guide to the Self-Driving Car MarketandExploring the Uncharted World of Artificial IntelligenceZacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?

Zacks.com featured highlights: Tesla Motors, Icahn Enterprises, Exa, 8x8 and Ocwen Financial;1/11/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 11, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article includeTesla Motors(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),Icahn Enterprises(NASDAQ:IEP-Free Report),Exa Corp.(NASDAQ:EXA-Free Report),8x8, Inc.(NASDAQ:EGHT-Free Report) andOcwen Financial Corp.(NYSE:OCN-Free Report).Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin   Matras:A Company's First Profits Can Mean Big Profits for     InvestorsWith earnings season having just begun, now is a great time to take a look at my 'First Profit' stock screen. The concept for this one is to identify companies that have recently shown their first quarterly profit within the last year.More specifically, to find companies that havenotshown a profit for at least the previous 4 quarters, but have just recently produced their first profit this last quarter.I run this screen after every earnings season. And here we are again.Some of these companies will be relatively new, and this recent profit may be the only profit in the company's history so far.Other companies may have a long history of profitability, but for whatever reason haven't seen a profit in a while -- but has finally returned to profitability.I like this concept because, if the trend has been one of improvement, there's a good chance the trend will continue. This is true whether you've been profitable or arejust gettingprofitable.But some people (like myself for example) dislike buying companies that cannot show a profit. And there are many others who won't even consider a stock unless it's making money.Losing less than the previous quarter is indeed an improvement. And in that respect, by definition, it is growth, i.e., they're growing less unprofitable. And it's even better if the losses are less and less in each sequential quarter.But there's something entirely different about growth AND being profitable. And those are the stocks that will likely see the best new demand from new investors; people who are now, all of a sudden, willing to take notice of, and pay attention to, the stock.And that's what we're screening for today:•EPS for the previous 4 Quarters less than or equal to 0(This means in each of the previous 4 quarters (except the most recently reported quarter) the company has reported earnings of less than or equal to zero, i.e., no profit.)•EPS for the recently reported quarter greater than 0makeArticleAd();(This time, the company reported earnings greater than zero, meaning they finally showed a profit.)•Current Price greater than or equal to 5(I prefer to only look at companies over $5. But if you drop this item from the screen, it'll currently produce three times as many stocks coming thru the screen.)The screen is pretty simple yet pretty powerful.Here are 5 stocks that made it thru this week's screen:(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) Tesla Motors(NASDAQ:IEP-Free Report) Icahn Enterprises(NASDAQ:EXA-Free Report) Exa Corp.(NASDAQ:EGHT-Free Report) 8x8, Inc.(NYSE:OCN-Free Report) Ocwen Financial Corp.Get the rest of the stocks on this list and start looking for the newest companies that fit this criteria.

Tesla Just Hired the Creator of Apple, Inc.'s Swift Programming Language;1/11/2017;"Electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) announced on Tuesday that it just snapped upApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) director of developer tools, Chris Lattner. The   executive was integral at Apple, responsible for creating Swift,   a new programming language the tech giant announced in 2014. The   important hire comes at a critical time for Tesla as it works to   advance the software behind its next-generation driver-assist   sensor system for Autopilot.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();From Swift to AutopilotLattner's decision to leave Apple and join Tesla ""wasn't taken   lightly,"" according to a statement Lattner posted on Swift.org to   explain the move. Indeed, Lattner said he won't be entirely   leaving the Swift community. ""I plan to remain an active   member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the   swift-evolution mailing list,"" he said.But make no mistake. Lattner is definitely leaving Apple and   joining Tesla. In fact, he confirmed in his post that he will be   leaving Apple later this month.At Tesla, Lattner will take on the title of vice president of   Autopilot software. Lattner will take over for Jinnah   Hosein, SpaceX's vice president of software, who was   ""serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla   Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time,"" Tesla   said in a blog post on Tuesday. ""We are very excited that   Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and   accelerate the future of autonomous driving,"" Tesla said.To fill Lattner's role with the Swift programming language,   Apple's Ted Kremenek, who is currently the senior manager of   languages and runtimes at Apple, will now lead the day-to-day   operations of the Swift Core Team.Furthermore, just as Lattner is stepping up to lead Tesla's   Autopilot team, Tesla's director of Autopilot programs, Sterling   Anderson, is leaving the company. Interestingly, shortly after   the news broke, Anderson mysteriously tweeted, ""You ain't seen   nothing yet...""Taking Autopilot to the next levelLattner joins Tesla's Autopilot team at a crucial period for   the technology's development, only a few months after the company   made the surprising announcement that it started including full   self-driving hardware in every vehicle it ships.The new hardware included in Tesla vehicles includes eight   surround cameras for 360-degree visibility for up to 250 meters   of range, 12 improved ultrasonic sensors, forward-facing radar,   and a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing   power of its predecessor.Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its next-generation   Autopilot system. Image source: Tesla Motors.The sudden inclusion of the new hardware in every vehicle   Tesla produces has presented challenges for the company, which,   according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk in December, have the   Autopilot team working seven days a week.First, vehicles with the new hardware temporarily lack   Autopilot features included in vehicles with the older hardware   as the company validates the software using customer data   generated from operating the new Autopilot sensors in shadow mode   as Tesla owners go about their normal day-to-day driving. While   the company has started releasing updates to a portion of its   vehicles delivered with the new hardware, Musk recently said he   hopes the company will be ready this weekend to finally release   an update to bring all new-hardware vehicles to feature parity   with older vehicles.Second, the new Autopilot sensors presented manufacturing   problems during the company's fourth quarter, as Tesla blamed""short-term production challenges""related to its transition to the new sensors for its   worse-than-expected deliveries for the quarter.Autopilot's ongoing development is an important piece of   Tesla's business as it aggressively pursues autonomous   vehicles.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Rooftop Solar Stocks Plunged in 2016;1/10/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.After a decade of rocketing growth, 2016 was a very tough year   for the rooftop solar industry. Growth slowed dramatically and   the introduction of the loan as a viable financing option upended   the lease/power purchase agreement (PPA) model that's driven the   industry to where it is today.makeArticleAd();Vivint Solar Inc.(NYSE: VSLR) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) both ended the year down more than 50%, and before   being bought out byTesla Motors Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) , SolarCity's stock was down 60%. The challenge   heading into 2017 is that the pressures rooftop solar is facing   aren't going to get any easier.RUNdata byYCharts.Why growth disappeared in 2016The big shock of the past year has been the massive slowdown   in residential solar growth. The extension of the Investment Tax   Credit has given the industry stability in federal subsidies, but   it's also removed the urgency of installing solar. And with costs   continuing to decline, it may make sense for customers to wait   rather than install rooftop solar today.According to SEIA/GTM Research'sU.S. Solar Market Insight Report, third-quarter residential solar installations were up just 2%   from a year ago and fell 10% sequentially. The industry overall   has had to adjust by cutting costs, particularly in sales and   marketing, and by focusing more on the profitable customers who   are left.Compounding the growth challenge is the fact that customers no   longer see signing a 20-year PPA/lease attractive given the low   cost of installations and greater availability of loans, which   was a shock to Vivint's, Sunrun's, and SolarCity's business   models.Financing changes courseThe rooftop solar industry was built on third-party financing   in the form of PPAs and leases. Solar companies were able to use   tax benefits more efficiently than customers and could get better   financing terms, mainly because banks didn't know how to finance   one-off rooftop solar systems. But as the industry has grown and   costs have come down, the tax benefits have become easier for   homeowners to use and banks have begun to offer financing   solutions.Image source: Getty Images.This trend toward loans took hold in 2016 and threw the   industry into turmoil. Regional installers began taking market   share from industry leaders Vivint, SolarCity, and Sunrun because   they were more flexible in financing offerings. The larger   installers had to respond by offering their own loan products,   but that highlighted that their entire organizational structures   were built for third-party leasing, not competing for customers   based on price alone (enabled by loans).We still don't know how the financing changes will shake out   in the solar industry, but it's fair to say that much of the   competitive advantage the public solar companies had going into   2016 diminished during the year. Now, regional installers are   developing their growth strategies and larger companies have to   find a new way to differentiate themselves to stay alive.How solar installers can adaptOffering loans isn't inherently a problem for any solar   installer. In a way, it can be a positive because instead of   taking the financing risk onto the balance sheet, the risk goes   to the bank providing the loan and the installer gets cash up   front.What's challenging is differentiating yourself when nearly   every installer is using the same equipment. Price becomes the   biggest differentiator, and that will lead to lower margins in   the long term.The best plan for installers is to find a way to differentiate   based on efficiency or ancillary offerings like energy storage or   energy management products. Tesla's plant under construction in   Buffalo, New York, intends to make high-efficiency solar panels   in an intention to squeeze more energy out of each roof. Vivint   and Sunrun could partner with a manufacturer likeLGorKyocera, for example, to do the same.Energy storage isn't economical in most states today, but it's   getting close. Building the infrastructure and software behind   energy storage and management could be a differentiation tough   for regional installers to match.Efficiency and energy storage are two ways publicly traded   solar installers can start to differentiate themselves, so look   for progress on that front in 2017.An uncertain future for rooftop solarWhat's clear is that in 2016 the rooftop solar business   got a lot more difficult and a lot less profitable for Vivint   Solar, Sunrun, and Tesla's SolarCity. And the challenges they're   facing won't get easier in 2017 unless they can develop a   sustainable differentiation. That may be easier said than   done.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

And there are many others who won't even consider a stock unless it's making money.Losing less than the previous quarter is indeed an improvement. And in that respect, by definition, it is growth, i.e., they're growing less unprofitable. And it's even better if the losses are less and less in each sequential quarter.But there's something entirely different about growth AND being profitable. And those are the stocks that will likely see the best new demand from new investors; people who are now, all of a sudden, willing to take notice of, and pay attention to, the stock.And that's what we're screening for today:•EPS for the previous 4 Quarters less than or equal to 0(This means in each of the previous 4 quarters (except the most recently reported quarter) the company has reported earnings of less than or equal to zero, i.e., no profit.)•EPS for the recently reported quarter greater than 0(This time, the company reported earnings greater than zero, meaning they finally showed a profit.)•Current Price greater than or equal to 5(I prefer to only look at companies over $5.

NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz are Building AI-Powered Self-Driving Cars;1/10/2017;"On Tuesday, leading smartphone chipmaker NVIDIANVDAand Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler AGDDAIFhave announced a partnership to build self-driving cars powered by artificial intelligence (AI).Expected to hit the market within the next year, the cars will feature self-driving capabilities, and an active driver assistance function called ""Co-Pilot."" Co-Pilot looks to be similar to Tesla Motors'TSLAAutopilot, the company's semi-autonomous driving system.Autopilot-enabled vehicles keep the cars in-lane, adjust speed in accordance with other cars on the road, change lanes autonomously, scan for parking spaces, and even self-park. Co-Pilot, however, has the potential to be even more sophisticated.Speaking at the recent 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), NVIDIA founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and Mercedes-Benz Vice President of Digital Vehicle and Mobility Sajjad KhanbelieveAI is going to ""revolutionize"" automobiles going forward.""At this point it is very clear that AI is going to be the future of computing. This is an endeavor that we started three years ago that we will put on the road next year - unbelievable,"" Jen-Hsun said.Mercedes-Benz is not NVIDIA's first self-driving car collaboration. The company partnered with Tesla last year, and all Tesla models-Model S, Model X, and the Model 3, are equipped with an NVIDIA-powered on-board ""supercomputer"" that can provide full self-driving capability.NVIDIA also showed off two other self-driving cars at CES 2017: a Lincoln MKZ retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors, and an Audi Q7, which is equipped with the company's DRIVE PX 2 in-car computer. DRIVE learns by observing the action of human drivers, and the vehicles were ""trained"" in Vegas on only four days of driving before debuting at CES.For more information on self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, check out these Zacks articles:Your Ultimate Guide to the Self-Driving Car MarketandExploring the Uncharted World of Artificial IntelligenceZacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?

Commit To Purchase Tesla Motors At $60, Earn 6.3% Using Options;1/10/2017;"Investors eyeing a purchase of Tesla Motors Inc (Symbol: TSLA) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $228.30/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $60 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.3% return against the $60 commitment, or a 3.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to TSLA's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $60 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked). So unless Tesla Motors Inc sees its shares fall 73.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $56.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.80 from $60), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.1% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Tesla Motors Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $60 strike for the 3.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Tesla Motors Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $228.30) to be 39%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there inoptions tradingso far today.Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today.Top YieldBoost Puts of the Nasdaq 100 »"

3 Strong Stocks to Invest in the Driverless-Car Race;1/10/2017;"Driverless-car stocks are revving up for a record-breaking   year. If you're on the hunt for a pure play on the trend, though,   you're out of luck. There are essentially no publicly traded   companies dealing exclusively in driverless cars. But at The   Motley Fool, we're always on the lookout for creative investment   angles. Here are three driverless-car stocks that let you invest   in the technology, the car, and the data for the driverless-car revolution.1. MobilEye -- The technologyMobilEye Co-Founder and CTO Amnon Shashua. Image source:   BMW.makeArticleAd();Jerusalem-basedMobilEye(NYSE: MBLY) is as pure a play as they come for driverless-car   stocks. It manufactures the cameras for advanced driver   assistance systems in approximately 220 car models. In July,   MobilEye announced apartnershipwithBMWandIntelto develop an autonomous-vehicle platform by 2021. Just a month   later, it went even further when it announced a partnership with   auto supplierDelphi Automotiveto develop a""plug-and-play"" self-driving platformavailable for any automaker to adopt by 2017.MobilEye seems to be poised for profit -- it just announced a   34% year-over-year quarterly revenue increase and prides itself   on an asset-light business model. For investors, this signals   both a buying opportunity and a valuation warning. Its stock   jumped 27% after the recent news and has wavered back and forth   over the past few years alongside industry-level bullishness and   stock-specific announcements. Investors in MobilEye should be   bullish on the commoditization of driverless technology and have   a long-term perspective to weather the ups and downs that will   probably continue.MBLYdata byYCharts.2. Tesla Motors -- The carImage source: Tesla Motors.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is not a driverless-car stock, but it is vehement   in its belief that automation is the automotive future. All its   vehicles come equipped with Autopilot, a technology that Tesla   founder and CEO Elon Musk says will allow Teslas to drive   themselves across the country by (hopefully) 2018. As a first   major adopter of semi-autonomous driving, Tesla has experienced   setbacks, most notably a driver fatality last May.A Tesla Motors stock investment allows investors to get behind   the wheel of an already-scaling semi-driverless carl, something that no other company can offer. But Tesla is also   much more than a driverless-car stock. The company is, first and   foremost, a (driver-filled) car company. Its recent $2 billion   merger with SolarCity also makes it a solar company, an industry   with substantial regulatory unknowns of its own. The company is   betting on significant synergies by packaging solar rooftops with   car sales, but these major moves have kept many investors on the   fence about its future. For Tesla to make the driverless-car   stock list, investors need to be sure they're bullish on its   entire business.3. Alphabet -- The dataVideo source: Waymo viaYoutube.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , the parent company of Google,   has been making major moves in the driverless-car space. The   company has spent more than $60 million to bump humans out of the   driver's seat, and last October, it announced that it had clocked   a whopping 2 million road miles on its autonomous vehicles. Last   month, Alphabet went a step further by redefining its automation   efforts as a full-fledged spinoff business dubbed Waymo, rather   than one of its prototype ""moonshot"" projects.Alphabet and Waymo have made clear that they're not interested   in car manufacturing, a hat tip to others such as BMW that are   already well entrenched in this space. Instead, it will focus on   taking what it's learned from its cute ""panda car"" prototypes and   transferring it to commercial cars, such as the 100ChryslerPacifica Hybrid minivans that are set to join Waymo's fleet in   early 2017. Waymo has a strong technological advantage over many   competitors, but where it truly shines is its access to and   refinement of data. Self-driving cars risk being aimless   wanderers without enough information about their surroundings,   and Alphabet has more information about the world than anyone   else, and is continuing to learn how best to use it in the quest   for an autonomous vehicle.With an Alphabet investment, investors need to understand that   driverless cars are not one slice of this company's pie --   they're a crumb. With Alphabet's $550 billion market cap, Waymo's   minuscule $60 million fleet of pandas and minivans is not what   this company's counting on to drive profits in the years to come.   But Waymo is yet another example of how Alphabet is capitalizing   on its core competitive advantage in ways that were not   previously expected -- and if that's what you're interested in   investing in, then Alphabet may be the driverless-car stock for   you.Pedal to the metal?With driverless-car technology still in its infancy, it can be   tempting to take a backseat to investing in this industry. But   for risk-tolerant investors with a long-term perspective, getting   in on the ground floor of a driverless-car stock might be the   best way to snag major returns in the years to come, whether it's   by investing in the technology, the car, or the data.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a “Hold” at Best;1/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince 2012, automotive-industry disrupterTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has raised roughly$6.5 billion from investorsto support its audacious ambitions.Source: ShutterstockSo far, Tesla stock has accumulated losses in the billions from the capital it's raised. But as you may well know, past performance has little to do with what might happen in the future.makeArticleAd();Also, in its current full year (2015 to 2016 results have yet to be finalized) of operations, Tesla reported a loss of $888 million and spent $1.6 billion to develop new factories and manufacturing capabilities, including a pioneering ""gigafactory"" to churn out scores of lithium batteries for its automobiles and burgeoning solar operations.10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not     Help ItTesla also issued more than $300 million in debt and sold another $730 million in stock. Revolutionizing industries is not a cheap undertaking.Things got more interesting in July when Tesla announced it would purchase SolarCity. Investors approved the deal and SolarCity was folded into the corporate fold. The term ""clean energy empire"" has been mentioned, with potential synergies of using Tesla's batteries to store energy produced from solar panels on the top of consumer roofs. Clean energy is the all-around goal.Tesla's Auto AmbitionsOf course, Tesla has huge plans and first intends to revolutionize the automotive industry. In many respects, it isjust getting warmed upas a company. Its fourth-quarter net orders for new cars (its Model S and Model X) jumped 52%. Vehicle production increased an impressive 64% to nearly 84,000 vehicles for all of 2016.Scale is key for Tesla's vehicle operations. It will improve car reliability and lower warranty costs because of manufacturing efficiencies. Growth also provides operating leverage. More sales help offset fixed costs in factories, showrooms and everything that goes with building a car company from the ground up. Management likes to highlight a steady improvement in gross margins to illustrate the benefits of its growing scale.The Solar and Autonomous Auto WildcardsThe same goes for SolarCity. Elon Musk, who effectively controlled both Tesla and SolarCity before they merged, spoke to creating a solar roof product for homes. Manufacturing scale also benefits the production of solar panels and distributing throughout the country. High-efficiency cells at a low cost is the goal in this part of the business.Tesla also has big plans for self-driving cars. Other players in the space include the venture capital unit ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), who builds chips to support autonomous vehicle capabilities.Is Tesla Too Ambitious?There is certainly an argument to be made that Tesla is too ambitious. Musk has spoken about producing a million cars by 2020, and its gigafactory is said to cost as much as $5 billion, though other partners and suppliers will share in the expense.SolarCity is thought to be cash flow neutral when it is officially folded in during the last quarter of 2016. However, it did add more debt to the capital structure.Analysts are projecting earnings losses for 2016 and 2017. This year, they estimate a loss of $2.15, but a significant improvement to a loss of only 73 cents for all of 2017.Those that are offering an investment opinion overwhelmingly believe the stock is a ""hold"" (versus a sell or buy) right now.There is little denying the investment uncertainty is high for Tesla stock. There are many moving parts, and there isn't much current visibility on positive profit or cash flow production. In fact, there are likely to be many more years of aggressive spending and investment to scale the car and solar operations.The Bottom Line on Tesla StockThe market capitalization for Tesla stock currently sits around $37 billion. That seems a rather high number for a company generating only about $6 billion in annual sales and nothing to speak of in terms of profits.An investment in Tesla stock is really a call on Elon Musk's ambitions and his vision of creating a truly revolutionary automotive and energy firm. Certainly, energy stored via batteries has many benefits over current technologies supported by gas and other fossil fuels to create energy.Storing energy through batteries has huge potential ramifications for the global energy sector, and helping scale that development via a giant gigafactory in the Nevada desert could turn out truly revolutionary.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in     2017But investing in the potential is another story.To me, it seems too risky to hope that sales and profits come flowing in within a decade. There will likely be many ups and downs, with many chances for investors to buy in with more certainty down the road.Until then, they might want to consider stodgyGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM), which has a reasonable valuation and high dividend yield. It won't benefit from the growth in consumer solar panels, but stands a good chance at participating in the electric and autonomous automobile markets that Tesla is paving a new path in.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 of the Worst Values on Wall StreetThe 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThe postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a ""Hold"" at Bestappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is a Survivor;1/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsWhether it's good news or bad news forAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) shareholders remains to be seen, but the e-commerce giant is   finally starting to crack down on the counterfeit merchandise   that's a little too easy to buy (usually unknowingly) through its   online-shopping sites. Last week, the Chinese e-tailer sued two   vendors for selling fake Swarovski watches.The upside to the value of BABA stock is that with this official   anti-bootlegged-brands stance, Alibaba's e-commerce site gains   more credibility as a venue … among consumers as well as   vendors.makeArticleAd();The downside is, a big chunk of Alibaba stock was built   on sales of low-cost counterfeit goods. On balance though,   there's not quite as much risk to BABA stock in the   company's newest position on fakes.BABA: Enough Is EnoughAny statistic that describes the amount of fake merchandise   available via Alibaba's e-commerce platform should be taken with   a grain of salt; nobody truly knows. That hasn't prevented   counterfeit watchdog NetNames from taking a guess though; it   believes anywherebetween 20% and 80%of the goods sold via Alibaba's Taoboa aren't actually made by   the companies their logos, looks and tags are supposed to   imply.NetNames' suggested range of fake merchandise sold by Alibaba   is admittedly wide, but that disparity underscores the complexity   of the problem. Even if the real number is somewhere in the   middle though, at 50%, that's still 50% too much.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksIt's an issue that has nagged BABA stock holders for years,   though it has become a much more serious concern over the course   of the past year or so. In fact, the problem of knock-offs became   so prevalent that Gucci parent company Kering SA filed a suit   against Alibaba in mid-2015, claiming that not only did the   company not do enough to prevent counterfeit goods from   being sold at its website, but thatAlibaba actually encouraged it.Kering SA's suit was just a microcosm of how other brand names   felt at the time.The lawsuit, along with pressure from Chinese regulators,   appeared to get CEO Jack Ma's attention,finally prompting him to say,""There's no ceiling for investing in fighting fake goods"" early   last year. Little changed in the months that followed, however.   Indeed, Ma was almost defiant of the backlash in June of last   year,saying:""The problem is that the fake products today, they make better   quality, better prices than the real products, the real names….   It's not the fake products that destroy them [the real designers   making authentic goods], it's the new business models.""He may well be right, but it's not a philosophy that flies   with regulators or brand-names.The ongoing pressure seems to have finally sunk in, though.   That, or the fact that the Office of the United States Trade   Representative officially (once again)blacklisted Taobao in Decemberseems to have gotten Ma's attention. Last week,Alibaba filed lawsuitsagainst two of its merchants for knowingly selling counterfeit   goods. Presumably, the company will continue to file suits until   it makes the point that fake goods won't be tolerated at its   e-commerce venue.Or, will it?Impact on Alibaba StockIt's easy to make examples of two vendors when there are   thousands more that may or may not notice, or care. If Ma wants   to make a statement that matters, he'll need to take aim more   often, with a bigger gun.And therein lies the rub … it's not clear to what extent Ma   actually wants to crack down on the sale of fake goods at the   Taobao website.In the same sense, it's impossible to determine exactly how   much of the merchandise sold via Alibaba sites is counterfeit;   it's impossible to determine how much business may be lost (and   not won back with sales of authentic goods) should Alibaba crimp   down on bootlegged brands. But, if fake merchandise accounts for   half the goods sold by the e-commerce giant, such measures may   not actually be good for business, or for BABA stock.And ""half"" may be a generous estimate. In January of last   year, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce   released a study it had commissionedsuggesting that only 37% of the merchandise   available on Taobao was genuine.It's in that light that the underpinnings of the lawsuits may   not be as heartfelt as the more visible suggestion of them is. As   Nissan's William Forsythecommented late last year, ""They are counting the money with their left hand, and covering   their eyes with their right.""To that end, it's not clear if Chinese regulators are entirely   on board with the premise either.Counterfeiting is almost a $400 billion industry   in China, accounting for roughly 12% of its exports. Alibaba is a big   reason that industry has managed to grow at a time the nation   desperately needed more jobs to meet its growth goals. If Taobao   can't sell a big chunk of those goods, the ripple effect could be   significant.Fortunately, there's more bark than bite with the most recent   anti-counterfeiting showmanship.Bottom Line for BABA StockFor better or worse, Ma isn't terribly serious about quelling   sales of sham goods via Taobao. It's one of those things where   consumers - most of them anyway - quietly know the game,   understanding no authentic Gucci handbag can sell for $30.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in       2017The real Gucci has good reason not to like it, but a buyer of   a $30 knockoff isn't apt to be a potential buyer for the real   thing. And, even to the extent fake merchandise should be   combated, the sheer number of those vendors makes it an almost   insurmountable task.In other words, Alibaba stock holders worried the two   recently filed lawsuits mark the beginning of a much more   disruptive period for the e-commerce giant need not worry.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in       20177 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the       BankThe postWhy Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is a   Survivorappeared first onInvestorPlace."

My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings in 2017;1/9/2017;"With 2017 underway, these three companies account for a larger   portion of my portfolio than any other investments:Walt Disney(NYSE: DIS) ,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) . Here's a quick overview of why I'm betting on   these three companies -- and what I consider to be their biggest   risks.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Walt Disney: Iconic entertainmentMy investment thesis:While WaltDisney stockhas gained about 19% since I called it ""my top stock to buy in October,"" the higher share price hasn't tempted me one bit to sell the   stock. Indeed, as my biggest holding, Walt Disney characterizes   the sort of buy-and-hold investments I love. In short, I'm   betting on Disney stock because I believe the market is   undervaluing the staying power of the company's enduring   entertainment brands, including ESPN, Pixar, Marvel, Stars Wars,   and the Walt Disney brand itself.Image source: Walt Disney.Sure, Disney's price-to-earnings ratio of 19 may not exactly   make the stock look cheap, but for a company as dominant and   iconic as Walt Disney, I'm happy to pay a premium price in   anticipation of sustained growth across a diversified   portfolio of powerful brands.The biggest risk:Disney's ESPN is having trouble growing in a multiscreen,   streaming-video environment. Accounting for more of the company's   operating profits than any other brand, Disney will need to find   a way to make ESPN relevant in a rapidly evolving media   landscape.Model 3. Tesla plans to begin delivering its $35,000 Model 3     in the second half of this year. Image source: Tesla     Motors.Tesla Motors: A big opportunityMy investment thesis:After garnering about 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for its   Model 3, Tesla has previewed a large market for electric   vehicles. And the company'sconsistent 50% annualized growth in vehicle   deliveriespaired with itsbig investmentsfor even more growth in the years to come set the automaker up to   maintain its leadership position in a fast-growing market.The biggest risk:Tesla's $38 billion market capitalization already prices in   significant growth. Therefore, if the company has trouble   executing on its growth plans, it may miss an opportunity to   reinforce its leadership position and subsequently fail to live   up to the market's optimistic expectations.Facebook: A lucrative businessMy investment thesis:In Facebook, investors get an enduring competitive advantage,   industry leadership, and a profitable business model all at the   same time.Image source: Facebook.The social network's 1.8 billion monthly active users give   Facebook unprecedented value as a social platform and keeps them   coming back. Indeed, Facebook is so pervasive in many users'   lives that leaving it would represent somewhat of a social   compromise. As marketers buy up ad spots to cash in on this user   attention, Facebook's revenue is soaring and its profits are   growing even faster thanks to operating leverage. Facebook's   third-quarter net income was a whopping $2.4 billion, up 166%   from $896 million in the year-ago period.Facebook's social network looks poised to remain both dominant   and highly profitable for years to come.The biggest risk:If competition from other social networks ever begins to steal   significant attention away from Facebook, the cost of maintaining   a market-leading position could increase and Facebook's   profitability could take a hit.While I don't plan on selling any of these stocks for years to   come, I would reevaluate my investment theses if any of the risks   outlined here -- or any other unforeseen challenges -- disrupt   these companies' potential. But my hope is that I can hold these   stocks for years. Indeed, as long as management meets or exceeds   my expectations in the years ahead, I may even add to these   positions.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?;1/9/2017;"Image: AFP/Getty ImagesBy now, I think we all know what Uber is, what it does, and how it makes our lives easier. Bought too many groceries? Get an Uber. Too drunk? Get an Uber. Stressful day at work? Uber. Like magic-now, it's really an expectation-any transportation woes vanish with the digital sight of a car heading your way.Launched only seven years ago,Uber Technologies Inc.is an app-based transportation company headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in about 270 cities and more than 60 countries worldwide. Using the app is easy: just type in your current location, where you want to go, and hit request. From there, Uber uses its app to receive its ride requests, sending them out to drivers who transport customers to their final destination.Increased CompetitionThe emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.In addition to the now-defunct Sidecar, companies like Lyft, Curb, Southeast Asia-based Grab, India's Ola, and especially China's Didi Chuxing have all started to eat into the ride-hailing market share, becominghuge competitorsfor Uber. Didi is arguably Uber's biggest threat overseas, and the ride-sharing giant conceded defeat in August,selling its UberChina operationsto Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies.Even Alphabet Inc.GOOGLis becoming a threat to Uber, with plans to make its self-driving cars unit a stand-alone business. This initiative could put the company in direct competition with Uber, as the lack of a driver could keep costs down in the long-term. The company's Google division also recently began a pilot program with Waze, a company they acquired in 2013, that enables thousands of San Francisco commuters to join carpools; Waze also offers real-time driving directions based on information from other drivers.Self-Driving, Uber StyleBut Uber is right on Google's heels, and asself-driving car technologybecomes more commercially available, Uber has been constantly beefing up its business strategies focused on autonomous driving. Back in September, it began testing its self-driving FordFFusions in Pittsburgh; engineers rode in the driver's seat, ready to take over whenever things got tricky.Uber then introduced self-driving Volvo XC90s to San Francisco in December, and riders who requested an uberX were matched with one of these vehicles if one was available. Just days later, however, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for its self-driving cars, as the company didn't have the proper permits.But Uber being Uber, the fleet of Volvos were on their way to Arizona within days. Uber already operates a self-driving car program in the state, and in 2015, partnered with the University of Arizona to research mapping technology.Uber also recently acquired car start-up Otto, which specializes in self-driving trucks. Otto is a 90-person company, and its co-founder, Anthony Levandowski, will now lead Uber into the self-driving car market. Impressively, Otto engineers have worked at Tesla MotorsTSLA, AppleAAPL, and Google, and with this knowledge and expertise, Uber is bound to be a top player in the self-driving car industry.ControversyWhile Uber has seen great success, it's journey has been a bumpy one. The company has been in and out of the news thanks to legal and publicity issues in a number of countries. From noncompliance issues in New York City to regulatory concerns and lack of driver background checks, Uber has drawn scrutiny and criticism, and has even been banned in The Netherlands and in parts of Thailand, India, and China.It's no secret that traditional taxi services are not happy with the rise of Uber and other ride-hailing companies, and many argue that Uber should be subject to the same regulations that they face. In dozens of cities it has moved in to, Uber has faced intense opposition, lobbying, and legal challenges against it from these taxi companies.Uber has also been embroiled in along-standing battlewith its drivers. A group of drivers first sued the company back in 2013, claiming they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. As a result, Uber had been set to pay up to $100 million in reimbursement damages to almost 400,000 drivers, but recently, a federal judge in California ruled that the settlement was unfair.But as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, and all of the bad press has yet to really negatively affect Uber. Despitelosing over $1 billionin the first half of 2016, Uber gained just as much revenue in that same time period. Its ability to raise exorbitant amounts of money is incredibly impressive for a company who is less than a decade old, and this skill makes Uber that much more attractive to venture capital investors.IPO PotentialDespite these controversies, investors are eagerly awaiting an Uber IPO. Many have believed, or hoped, the company would go public for a few years now, but Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wants ""to make sure [an IPO] happens as late as possible,"" said in an interview withCNBClast year.If and when Uber finally decides to go public, its potential would depend on the broader IPO market and economic environment. According to Renaissance Capital, IPOs only raised a paltry $18.9 billion in 2016, with annual proceeds falling to the lowest level since 2003. Just four companies filed public offerings that grossed over $1 billion.Looking ahead, it's difficult to pinpoint how busy the IPO market will be this year. Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, music streaming platform Spotify, and other major tech giants have signaled plans to go public in 2017. And recent high-growth IPOs like Twilio Inc.TWLOand NutanixNTNXhave traded strongly since their debut, a good sign for tech companies everywhere looking to make their trading debut.How Might Uber Perform?An IPO for Uber could be massive for both the company and Wall Street. It's currently valued at $68 billion after a total of nine rounds of funding worth $12.9 billion since its launch. And thanks to Uber's structure-a unique combination of transportation company, mobile Internet company, and real world engineering-the company has been touted as one of the best future IPOs.It's IPO, then, could go either way, but let one number stay in your mind: $68 billion. Let me write that again: $68 billion. This number is a hard one to forget, and a figure that will be on the forefront of many investors' minds come the time of its public offering, as it impressively showcases just how far this startup has come in a few short years.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe first rule of medicine is to do no harm. Your retirement, like your health, is something that you can't afford to screw up. And as with your health, having a safe and stable retirement is generally less about doing things right and more about avoiding major mistakes.Source: ShutterstockJust as you don't have to be a marathon runner to live a long, healthy life, you don't have to have Warren Buffett's stock picking acumen to retire well. Just avoid excessive booze or tobacco - or taking large losses in the stock market - and you're well on your way.makeArticleAd();Today, we're going to look at 10 stocks that you should probably avoid in a retirement portfolio. None are necessarily bad stocks totrade. In fact, I'd argue that there is no such thing as a bad stock to trade if you're doing it with capital you're comfortable putting at risk. But there is a difference between a stock you trade for short-term profit and a stock that you're planning to use to fund your retirement.A retirement stock should be one that has survived the test of time and that is ""future proof,"" or at least as future proof as a company can be these days. This rules out most technology stocks, which often have short lives as disruptors before being disrupted themselves, and stocks that depend on fickle consumer tastes.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017So with no more ado, here are 10 stocks that are more likely to hurt your retirement than help it.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Tesla (TSLA)Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a stock that I want to like. I really do. I love Elon Musk's vision for the company, and I can credibly say that Musk and Tesla have done more to promote alternative energy and driverless cars than just about anyone else out there.When we enjoy an emission-free future in which our cars drive us to work while we browse our messages and sip on lattes, we'll have Musk to thank for that reality.The problem is, I'm not sure Tesla is going to be the company to benefit from it. Tesla may or may not even be in business a decade from now. You see, while Tesla might have started the revolution, its larger, more entrenched competitors have been quick to muscle in. Virtually every large automaker is experimenting with driverless technology, and most are working on green alternatives.Meanwhile, Tesla stock trades for nearly seven times sales … and actually loses money.So, while I wish Mr. Musk the best of luck - and look forward to enjoying the fruits of his labor - I don't want to put my retirement at risk by buying the stock.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Twitter (TWTR)Source:Christopher via FlickrAnother tech stock that has changed the world, yet can't seem to find a way to profit from it isTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR).Twitter has effectively remade the news industry as we know it. It's become the medium of choice for politicians, celebrities and other media personalities to make major announcements … or to just rant.Yet, unlike rivalFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), it still hasn't quite figured out its profit model yet. Facebook finds new and creative ways to squeeze more profitability out of its user base while also expanding that user base. Yet Twitter seems to have mostly stalled out. It's also been overrun by spammers and ""bot"" accounts, which reduces its attractiveness to would-be advertisers.7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     BankTwitter trades for about five times sales, which is more or less in line with many other large tech companies. Yet Twitter is still struggling to figure out its business model, which is ridiculous this late in the game. If you want a social media stock to buy and hold, go with Facebook … and dump Twitter.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Macy's (M)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrMacy's Inc(NYSE:M), after the beating it has taken of late, might actually be a decent short-term trade. But I wouldn't want to bet my retirement portfolio on it.Macy's, along with several other department stores, had a lousy holiday shopping season - and this despite American shoppers eagerly opening their wallets in 2016.The issue is that Americans are doing more and more of their shopping online these days, benefitting the likes ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and its online peers. Brick-and-mortar retailers in general have suffered, and big department stores like Macy's have suffered the worst.I don't expect department stores to collectively go out of business. After a period of consolidation, they will find their new place in a retail market in which the primary role of a brick-and-mortar store is to act as a showroom of sorts. But after the dust settles, I'd recommend steering clear of department stores, at least with your retirement portfolio.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: IBM (IBM)Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) just can't seem to do anything right these days. Its revenues have been in decline for an almost unbelievable 18 consecutive quarters.That's four and a halfyearsof sales declines. You would think that by now the comparable sales would be so low that IBM would have an easy time posting at least modest growth … yet the losses continue.IBM is a perfect example of a company that is far from future proof. It's traditional business model was blown out of the water by cloud upstarts like Amazon andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), and IBM has adapted at a sluggish pace. Frankly, the IBM pedigree just isn't worth what it used to be.10 of the Worst Values on Wall StreetIBM was one of Warren Buffett's biggest portfolio additions of the past decade, and Buffett bought it precisely because he liked the recurring nature of IBM's income stream from long-term service contracts. Well, the cloud killed that business model, so it's time to move on. Dump IBM from your retirement portfolio.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Chipotle (CMG)Source: ShutterstockI loveChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.(NYSE:CMG) burritos. I really do. I could quite literally eat one every day of my life and never get sick of them (no E. coli pun intended). But as much as I love the company's food, the stock is one I'd consider risky as a long-term holding for a retirement portfolio.Food, like clothing, is subject to the whims of fashion. And Chipotle was one of the first chains to capitalize on the trend toward healthier eating with more organic ingredients. The problem is that there is no real durable competitive advantage there. Any Johnny-come-lately restaurant chain can jump on the organic bandwagon.Despite the beating that Chipotle stock has taken in recent years, due mostly to its health scandals and poor response, CMG stock is far from cheap at current prices. It trades for 44 times expected earnings. The stock price has been relatively stable for the past six months, and it could be the large losses have run their course. But this is still not a stock I'd want to bank my retirement on.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD)Source: ShutterstockAlong the same line, I'd recommending dumping shares ofBuffalo Wild Wings(NASDAQ:BWLD).As a seller of primarily wings and beer, Buffalo Wild Wings has definitely not ridden the healthy and organic eating wave that pushed Chipotle to success. No, this company's success is tied more to timeless appeal of beer and football, and the company has been in operation since 1982.30-plus years of service might suggest that Buffalo Wild Wings has survived the test of time and that it might actually be a decent long-term retirement stock. I disagree.Buffalo Wild Wing's nationwide expansion is a more recent endeavor, and its success has brought a host of competitors, includingWingstop Inc(NASDAQ:WING). The fact is, wings and beer got to be trendy a few years back, and the space is completely saturated at this point, not unlike the Tex-Mex space was 15 years ago. Diners got burned out with Tex-Mex, and I think wing shops are at risk of similar diner burnout.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryBuffalo Wild Wings isn't wildly expensive, trading at 23 times expected earnings. But I'd steer clear of it as a retirement stock.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Whole Foods (WFM)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Whole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) has the same problem that Chipotle does, and I'm not talking about food safety issues.Like Chipotle, Whole Foods was early to the healthy and organic movement. You could even argue that they were afounderof the movement and one of its biggest early beneficiaries.The problem, as with Chipotle, is that there is no real durable advantage there and nothing to stop its rivals from selling the same products … and doing so more cheaply.I like Whole Foods and I can credibly say that the average American eats healthier today in no small part due to the store's influence. But that doesn't mean I want to bet my retirement on it.WFM trades for 21 times expected earnings, which is a bit rich for a grocery store stock. Yes, Whole Foods is a premium store. I get that. But virtually every grocer in town is gentrifying its product lines, and you also have a budding new competitive threat from Amazon with home delivery … in some cases done by aerial drones.Buy Whole Food's produce if you like, but I'd steer clear of the stock.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Altria (MO)Source:Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)Even 10 years ago, I probably would have considered Marlboro-makerAltria Group Inc(NYSE:MO)to be a rock-solid retirement stock.After all, people have been smoking tobacco products since the Americas were discovered over 500 years ago. One might think that a half millennium is long enough to survive the test of time.But unfortunately for Altria, the times really have changed. Due to rising health costs, virtually every government in the world has made it their objective to reduce smoking, particularly among teenagers. And it's actually working; American teenagers are more likely to have used an illegal drug over the past year than smoked a cigarette.It's not necessarily a deal breaker to buy a stock in slow decline, so long as the stock is priced right. I've made good money trading tobacco stocks over the past 20 years when their prices have gotten sufficiently beaten down.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThe problem is, tobacco stock are far from cheap today. Altria trades for over 20 times expected earnings and yields just 3.5%. That's simply too high a price to pay for a company in terminal decline.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement:Coca-Cola (KO)Source:Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Along the same lines, I'd have to add the iconicThe Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) to the list. Now that governments have successfully beaten down tobacco use, they've moved their attention to the so-called obesity epidemic and its chief culprit: sugary sodas.And adding to this is the general trend toward healthier eating. Among the more fashionable sort, drinking a Coke is just so … déclassé.Hey, I like a cold Dr. Pepper as much as the next Texan, but we seem to be in the minority. Soda sales have been in decline for 11 consecutive years and counting.Now, Coca-Cola sells a lot more than just Coke and Diet Coke. The company has profitable businesses in bottled water, sports drinks and fruit juices. But it's hard to get enthusiastic about the company's prospects when its namesake product is in decline, with no sign of respite.At current prices, KO trades for 21 times earnings and yields 3.3%. That's not ridiculously expensive by any stretch, but it's not cheap enough given the company's growth problem. So for now, I'm recommending you dump Coca-Cola from your retirement portfolio.Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement:iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT)And finally, I'm going to recommend that you steer clear of bond index exchange-traded funds like theiShares 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF)(NASDAQ:TLT).Bonds have traditionally been an important part of most retirement portfolios, and even at today's low yields I think you could make a solid argument for including bonds. But including bonds and including bond ETFs are two very different things.It comes down to interest rate risk. A bond has no real interest rate risk if held to maturity. Rising yields will cause the market price to fall, but it doesn't really matter if you're not planning to sell. The bond will mature at its par value no matter what happens to prices between now and then. But bond ETFs don't have a fixed maturity. There are presumed to be perpetual. So if we were to enter a long period of rising yields (such as during the 1970s), your bond ETF would get killed.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksConsidering that one of the primary roles of bonds is toreducerisk of loss, that seems like a lousy bet. So if you own TLT, consider dumping it and replacing it with a proper ladder of individual bonds.Charles Sizemore is the principal ofSizemore   Capital Management, an investments firm based in Dallas.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 10th Birthday Also Marks the End of an Era;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHappy birthday to the iPhone! As difficult as it may be to recall a time when the popular, defining smartphone fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) wasn't around, it was ten years ago today the Steve Jobs vision for a portable, connected computer became reality.Source:via AppleEven more difficult to recall amongst the iPhone 10th birthday chatter is the fact that the device arguably turned a struggling, so-so company into an icon, and turned AAPL stock into one of the most fruitful investments of the past decade.makeArticleAd();Perhaps most difficult of all, though, is the fact that after seeing what a game-changer the iPhone has been - for the company as well as society - in just ten years, amostly disappointing response to the iPhone 7calls into question the marketability of the upcoming iPhone 8. Some AAPL shareholders are understandably concerned we may not even bother to remember the phone's 20th birthday.Phone 7 Marks End of Apple's Smartphone ReignThere's no denying the iPhone has earned its stripes. As they say, though, nothing lasts forever. A combination of time, saturation and competition has finally caught up with the iPhone.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017The evidence of this slowdown started to materialize with the response to the iPhone 6s late last year. It was the first iteration of the iPhone that not onlydidn't sell as well as its predecessors, but also the first to see a dropoff in sales in the two quarters following its launch.Some of the company's staunchest supporters explained that most consumers were holding out for the iPhone 7, which would be a superior device.Maybe there was some truth to the idea. The same party line is being recycled now, however, with would-be iPhone buyers now reportedly holding out for an iPhone 8. It leads one to wonder if the consumer response to the iPhone 8 will be as lackluster as the response to the iPhone 7 has been, with the bulk of them holding out for what will be the iPhone 8s or the iPhone 9.And that's when it hits AAPL investors right in the gut… at some point, the company has to sell iPhones right here, right now, and grow those sales as Apple managed to all the way through the iPhone 6.Perhaps the crux of the problem isn't would-be buyers waiting for the next version. Perhaps most everyone who is going to own any smartphone has a phone they can live with for a while. Perhaps competitors have finally figured out how to make a smartphone that's just as impressive as the iPhone used to be compared to alternatives. As mobile industry consultantChetan Sharma observed:""Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores. iPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way, Apple didn't have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away.""And make no mistake - the iPhone 7 hasn't been flying off the shelves the way it was expected to. Two weeks ago, the Nikkei Asian Review reported the companycut its planned Q1-2017 production of the iPhone 7 by 10%compared to iPhone production from a year earlier [production of the iPhone 6s].Let's also not forget that in September, for the first time in years, Apple unexpectedly opted to not share figures from the first weekend's sales of the iPhone 7. The company said they no longer mattered. Others believed the company simply didn't want to report weaker results.The iPhone 8 Can't Stop the InevitableBut can the iPhone 8 turn things around for the company, and relight a fire underneath AAPL stock?Maybe. The usual supporters are certainly hard at work again, pointing out theall-glass body, edge-to-edge screen, and the OLED display. They all seem and sound like improvements to its predecessor. With the exception to the rumored wireless charging though, the rumored specs may well be solutions to problems that don't actually exist.That has not prevented many people - including analysts - from predicting big things from the iPhone 8.Nomura Securities, as an example, believes the iPhone 8 will break all previous iPhone sales records. Just remember, though, it was Nomura that also said demand for the iPhone 7 waseven stronger than it had expected, and that the supply chain was on the verge of ramping up production of the device. Nomuraraised its price target on AAPL stockfrom $120 to $135 in response.In the meantime, not only have Apple shares not rallied to $135 (or even $120) on the heels of what was supposed to be a big catalyst, we've seen multiple reports suggesting demand for the device wasquickly quelled.Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in     2017Point being, take any optimism surrounding the iPhone 8 with a grain of salt. We've heard it before with the iPhone 7, and it was wrong.Bottom Line for AAPL StockStill, there's no denying the iPhone has earned a spot in the smartphone hall of fame. Though it wasn't the first to develop such a product - that honor belongs toBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) - Apple was the first to make the smartphone a mainstream consumer device, and for years was the name all others aspired to be like.Nothing lasts forever though. While Apple and the iPhone will both be around for the long haul, the dominance of the iPhone that made AAPL such a great trade is fading. It's unlikely we'll remember to celebrate its advent in January of 2027.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     Bank10 of the Worst Values on Wall StreetThe postApple Inc.

Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in 2017;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMaking an investment case forTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is not that difficult. One only needs to look toward the future. Autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and cleaner/renewable energy are expected to be strong growth drivers in the years ahead. And those are two of Tesla's main business segments. TSLA stock, then, should be in good hands.Source: ShutterstockAt last week's 2017Consumer Electronics Showin Las Vegas, for instance, cars and auto technology played an even bigger role compared to three to five years ago. The show included keynotes or presentations from almost every major automaker and A-list auto suppliers.makeArticleAd();In other words, Tesla - which arguably first intersected the auto and tech sectors - is in the right growth lane. While TSLA stock has yet to full respond to the growth drivers ahead, it's only a matter a time.Tesla Needs to Graduate From PotentialStill, Tesla's toughest challenge is to prove to critics that it can graduate the business from one of ""strong potential"" to a money-making venture. To date, that has been prevailing attack on CEO Elon Musk and what has kept Tesla stock from driving meaningfully higher over the past couple years.While Musk has delivered onthe company's new Gigafactory, which began production last week, Tesla againmissed on its most recent quarterly vehicle production target- keeping up a track record TSLA has been trying to shed. That news sent TSLA shares down some 2%.Tesla delivered roughly 22,200 vehicles during the last three months of 2016, falling short of the original projection of 25,000 units. For the full year, the electric car company delivered 76,230 units - also shy of the 80,000 vehicles Musk had promised to deliver.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksFrom my glass-half-full perspective, the fact that Tesla came less than 4,000 units shy of its full-year total wasencouraging. Critics, however, took the miss as more reasons to avoid TSLA stock.Said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson last week:""There is a high risk of execution missteps, a challenged track record on meeting timelines, cost challenges and potential impact from an otherwise full plate of initiatives in '17.""The Gigafactory Changes ThingsDespite the noise, there's also reason for increased optimism about Tesla stock. Notably,the new Gigafactory- which was delivered on time - could be the game-changer Tesla has needed.Once completed, the Gigafactory will be the world's largest factory of any kind, and eventually manufacture lithium-ion batteries for 500,000 vehicles annually, as well as for other purposes. Batteries are the limiting factor for electric cars, so Tesla's fix is to single-handedly double the world's lithium-ion battery production.While the Gigafactory - which is less than a third complete, and is expected to be finished by 2018 - has been expensive to build, estimated at $5 billion, it will accelerate the pace at which Tesla can become profitable since the Gigafactory can boost margins on unit sales of the Model S and Model X (and eventually the Model 3).At the same time, it's possible that competing auto manufactures such asFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) will rely on Tesla for their batteries.The 10 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017Bottom Line for TSLA StockTesla stock should be owned, not traded. While the company is spending tons of cash to deliver on its aggressive Model 3 production production totals for later this year, it's tough to bet against Musk.Assuming the company does reach its delivery target and begin Model 3 production this year, TSLA stock - currently at around $229 - is poised to regain its 2016 high of around $270.That would come out to roughly 20% returns in 2017.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a   position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

CES 2017: The Big Winner Was Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN) Alexa;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year's edition of the Consumer Electronics Show has wrapped up. The usual dazzling display of new TVs was there and as always, there were impractically wacky gadgets galore, many of them ""smart"" devices. Two companies that did not formally attend CES 2017 stood out this year.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) was everywhere, thanks to Alexa its virtual assistant.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), on the other hand was notable for a year in which third party companies werenotfalling over each other to show off the latest device designed to work with Apple's gear.CES 2017: Smart Cars, Smart Homes, Expensive TVsThis is CES, so TVs were everywhere. Big, bright, expensive TVs, many featuring QLED displays. There were new PCs, including crazy gaming laptops that cost as much as a small car and the smart home remained a big theme - evenhairbrushes got ""smart"" this year. To run all those connected devices, a new generation of mesh routers also had a moment in the spotlight.Of course, in recent years, the Consumer Electronics Show has morphed into an auto show as well. This year, there was a big reveal in theFaraday FutureFF 9. This luxury, high performance electric car has eyes on the market started byTesla Motors Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) - if it survives to see production. Also making news,Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F)announced it will integrate Amazon's Alexa voice assistant in its cars.CES 2017: The Hottest Headlines From Media Day 1And that news is the perfect segue into the idea that it was Amazon that won CES 2017.CES 2017: Amazon Alexa EverywhereLike Apple, Amazon didn't have a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show. But the company's Alexa voice assistant was seeminglyeverywhere. As mentioned, Ford is putting Alexa in its car infotainment systems (drivers can order items on Amazon or have an audiobook read back to them), and the auto maker is also giving Amazon Echo speakers advanced control over its plug-in electric cars, including the ability to start the car on command.Volkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY) also announcedAlexa integration is coming.Companies likeLGintroduced their own smart speakers, with Alexa inside. A series of new 4K TVs were introduced withbuilt-in Amazon Fire TV functionality, including Alexa voice control. Alexa showed up in home appliances, including refrigerators and washing machines. It's also in a smartwatch.ADT Corp(NYSE:ADT) announced homeowners will soon be able to voicecontrol its Pulse smart home security system using Alexa.And in perhaps the biggest coup of all - at least in terms of sticking it to the personal assistant competition - China's Huawei is releasing an Android-powered smartphone for the U.S. market thatfeatures Amazon's Alexa.Alexa is gaining momentum at a rapid pace. AMZN's Alexa-powered Echo speaker grew from 1,000 skills (third-party integrations) seven months ago toover 7,000 today.CES 2017: Apple SidelinedApple never attends the Consumer Electronics Show, but for the past decade or so, the company has always felt like the elephant in the room. Not physically there, but somehow in the middle of everything. Between the iPod, iPhone and iPad, it always seemed like half the companies at CES were releasing gadgets that were made specifically to work with Apple's hardware.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Shows Off Over-the-Air Updates and Fleet Learning;1/9/2017;"On Sunday morning,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk provided an update on the company's   ongoing rollout of its latest Autopilot upgrade. A planned   software update for Monday, and one more week's worth of fleet   data following the update, will probably be enough for Tesla to   finish rolling out its latest Autopilot improvement to all   vehicles with its new sensor suite, Musk said. The update shows   off Tesla's control of its driver-assist systems and its software   strengths.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Here comes Autopilot 2.0""New [revision] for [hardware 2] Autopilot rolling out Mon to   first 1000 [vehicles] & to rest of fleet in shadow mode,""   Musk tweeted on Sunday morning. ""Also improves hardware 1 and   enables Ludicrous+."" In another tweet, Musk said, ""If all looks   good, [hardware 2] Autopilot functionality will switch from   shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial   1000.""In October, Tesla started including a new sensor suite of   cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar in every new vehicle.   Aided by a new onboard computer with over 40 times the computing   power of the previous generation in Tesla vehicles, the company   said the new sensor suite would enable an ""enhanced"" version of   Autopilot and -- after regulatory approval and extensive   validation -- even self-driving capabilities.But, as Tesla explained in a blog post when it released its   new hardware, there was a major catch for the first vehicles   coming off the line with Autopilot hardware 2 -- at least for a   few months:Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain     features currently available on Teslas with first-generation     Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features     such as automatic emergency braking, collision warning, lane     holding and active cruise control. As these features are     robustly validated we will enable them over the air, together     with a rapidly expanding set of entirely new features.In December, Musk said Tesla's software team has been ""working   seven days a week to complete testing and validation"" of its   hardware 2 vehicles so it can roll out updates for them, getting   them to feature parity with Autopilot hardware 1 vehicles.Tesla rolled out its first update for hardware 2 Autopilot to   its first 1,000 cars on Dec. 31. Limited to such a small portion   of its fleet, the update aimed to help Tesla verify whether there   were new field issues before it uploaded an update to all   hardware 2 vehicles.Tesla's Monday update will get the company one step closer to   catching hardware 2 vehicles up to hardware 1, while also   delivering some new features for hardware 1 vehicles and apromised acceleration improvementfor its Ludicrous-enabled P100D vehicles, making the world's   fastest-accelerating vehicle even quicker.Highlighting Tesla's strengthsTesla's continued Autopilot updates highlight Tesla's prowess   in over-the-air updates and fleet learning -- two areas where the   automaker stands apart from the competition.Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its latest Autopilot   sensors. Image source: Tesla Motors.Tesla's in-house developed software for Autopilot, combined   with its high level of vertical integration of all relevant   systems, gives the company significant flexibility and control in   delivering significant over-the-air updates. Further, by   including Autopilot sensors in every vehicle delivered, whether   customers pay for Autopilot of not, Tesla can garner   unprecedented data by operating sensors in ""shadow mode"" even as   customers drive without the help of driver-assist systems. Of   course, Tesla can collect data from vehicles with activated   Autopilot as well.In addition, Tesla's deep vertical control of Autopilot   systems enables the company to rapidly deploy improvements   through its ""fleet learning,"" or fleetwide improvements that can   be made in real-time with real-time driving data. By having all   their cars connected and fleet learning, the level of useful data   Tesla is able to access for improving its system gives the   company an advantage in constantly improving the convenience and   safety of driver-assist systems.As long as Tesla's Autopilot updates go as planned -- and   considering the way the company has rapidly deployed significant   over-the-air updates to its vehicles in the past, they probably   will -- Tesla is about to take another step forward in advancing   its vehicles' driver-assist systems even further ahead of the   competition.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Another Reason Tesla and Trump May Be a Better Fit Than First Thought;1/7/2017;"After Donald Trump was elected to be the next president of the   United States in November, shares of electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA)  fell about 5% during the next seven days.   Some investors may have been concerned about how a   Republican-controlled White House and Congress could impact   electric-vehicle and solar incentives -- both of which play a   role in Tesla's business.But concerns about Tesla's prospects during a Trump presidency   have eased after the President-elect invited Tesla CEO Elon Musk   to his Tech Summit meeting, and even appointed him to his   Strategic and Policy forum. Indeed,Tesla stockproceeded to soar 17.5% in December.Now, investors may have another reason not to worry about   Tesla's potential during a Trump administration: Elon Musk thinks   the Trump administration could surprise when it comes to   renewables.makeArticleAd();Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Image source: The Motley   Fool.Report: Trump may be ""positive on renewables""In a telling report fromElectrek, managing editor Fred Lambert noted that investors attending   Tesla's Gigafactory event this week said Musk was actually upbeat   about Trump's plans for renewables:The President-elect has a strong emphasis on U.S.     manufacturing and so do we. We are building the biggest factory     in the world right here, creating U.S. jobs... I think we may     see some surprising things from the next administration. We     don't think they will be negative on fossil fuels... but they     may also be positive on renewables.While it's impossible to know exactly how the Trump   administration may ""be positive on renewables,"" Musk's words   about the President-elect should carry some weight after Musk'srecent face-to-face interactionswith Trump.Trump and Musk's shared vision for jobsIt's possible that Trump could be positive on green   technologies because of the potential jobs that could be created   from nascent renewables segments. It's no secret that one of   Trump's top priorities when he takes office is to create domestic   manufacturing jobs. And Musk's Tesla is arguably leading the   charge in the U.S. when it comes to job creation.Tesla alone has created over 13,000 jobs in the U.S.   (excluding contractors), most of which are manufacturing related.   And the Tesla-acquired SolarCity has created about 12,000 U.S.   jobs. Yet Tesla is just getting started.The company recently announced amajor expansionto its car factory in California -- the expansion will create   about 3,000 more jobs. Further, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said its   Gigafactory in Nevada will likely employ around 10,000 people at   peak production, and indirectly create between 20,000 to 30,000   additional jobs in surrounding regions.Tesla's under-construction Gigafactory in Nevada. Measured by   footprint, the factory will be the largest building in the world   when it's complete. Image source: Tesla Motors.Notably, however the Trump administration may impact   electric-vehicle and solar incentives, Musk is confident Tesla   will thrive. Indeed, Musk even noted in a November shareholder   meeting about the company's acquisition of SolarCity that he   believedTesla's competitive position would increaseif electric-vehicle incentives were removed, since under the   current zero-emission vehicle mandates, competitors would be able   to monetize their zero-emission vehicle credits at face value   while Tesla would only get about $0.50 on the dollar for its   credits.Still, Musk is far from being against renewables incentives.   During the same shareholder meeting, he said that Tesla does   believe ""there should be incentives."" But Musk said he believes   the incentives should exist ""for the good of the industry and to   accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, not because Tesla   needs them.""Whatever the fate is for renewables mandates and incentives   after Trump takes the Oval Office, Musk's surprising positivity   about the Trump administration's potential actions surrounding   renewables is good news for investors.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;1/6/2017;"After a year of both progress and stock market turmoil, the   solar industry is likely facing a year of transition in 2017.   Companies are cutting costs so they can stay afloat, and   positioning themselves for growth with new products. This week, a   few companies moved in different directions in relation to those   goals.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Solar ends 2016 in a great positionIf you're hoping to see more solar power produced around the   world, you should be very encouraged by new data fromBloomberg New Energy Finance. The group recently reported that the cost of building a solar   power plant is down 62% since 2009, and new contracts in Chile   and the UAE have been signed for less than 3 cents per kWh, a   price that would beat any new coal plant.Solar is already highly cost effective in sunny countries, but   what's even more encouraging is that costs will likely be lower   than coal in nearly every country within a decade. It's easy to   see how solar could be cost effective today in Chile, Dubai, or   states in the American Southwest, but the fact that it's becoming   price competitive in the U.K., Canada, and U.S. states like   Minnesota has to be encouraging for the industry.The Gigafactory finally gets off the groundA lot has been written aboutTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Gigafactory over the last few years, but this week   Tesla and Panasonic announced the facility is actually producing   battery cells. Eventually, the low-cost, high-performance 2170   cells jointly developed by the two companies will end up in   Tesla's Model 3. But for now, those coming off the assembly line   will be put into the Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2.2017 could be a big year for Tesla's energy storage business   as utilities put rates in place that make home energy storage   more viable, and large-scale storage solutions start to be good   options for utilities themselves. And now, some of those   batteries will be coming from Tesla's Gigafactory.Is another residential solar growth story going     bust?Last summer, residential solar company Sungevity seemed to   have found a bailout from Easterly Acquisition Corp., which would   have performed a reverse merger to take the company public. As   part of the deal, Sungevity would have gotten access to $200   million of capital, which could have kept it afloat while   management tried to steer it toward profitability.After the first of the year, the reverse merger is off, and   Sungevity seems to be in serious trouble. This isn't going to   upend residential solar as we know it because Sungevity had just   a 1.6% market share, according toGTM Research. But it's a sign of how difficult the business has been for   companies in the past year. Tesla's SolarCity had to lower its   guidance multiple times, and most companies had to pivot to   offering loans instead of long-term lease deals. Sungevity's   potential collapse is a another reminder of how hard it is to   make money in the rooftop solar business.Canadian Solar monetizes assetsThe year 2017 is going to be a tough year for solar panel   manufacturers and developers as demand sags and panel prices   continue slump. One of the ways companies are preparing for that   is by monetizing assets they have on their balance sheets.Canadian Solar Inc.(NASDAQ: CSIQ) did that just before the end of the year, selling   20 MW of Canadian projects for $115 million and two more power   plants in China for $32.2 million.The cash can now be used to pay down debt, reducing risk for   the business, or sit on the balance sheet to create a cushion. No   matter how you look at it, an infusion of $147.2 million is good   for Canadian Solar long term.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Set to Take Off;1/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor years,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has run on what amounts to the hype around charismatic founder Elon Musk and a cult following of drivers who see the cars as symbols of the future. But as the company's autopilot systems evolve and a key competitor hits a wall, the road to mass electric transport - the finish line for TSLA stock holders - looks clearer than ever.Source: ShutterstockAll of the buzz surrounding TSLA right now revolves around the mass-market Model 3 sedan, which should retail for around $35,000 when deliveries kick off late next year.makeArticleAd();This will be the ultimate test of Musk's master plan for growing the company beyond niche success and justifying its lofty valuation on Wall Street.A year from now, investors should have a much better sense of how fast TSLA can grab market share from old-school manufacturers likeGeneral Motors(NYSE:GM),Toyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F). If it happens even half as quickly as Musk is aiming for, the company's modest revenue targets will go through the roof.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThat's not including any input from the looming SolarCity acquisition, increased sales in the existing luxury segment or any models Musk currently has on the drawing board, like the SUV currently known only as""Model Y.""The analysts are busy watching the road to Model 3, so acceleration elsewhere in the company isn't really factored into the share price yet. If anything, expectations around TSLA may actually be cycling too low.That's a bold statement in a world where TSLA stock already trades at more than half the market capitalization of more sedate competitors like GM, despite operating at a loss and as yet generating barely 3% of the annual sales. But if Model 3 ramps up the way Musk expects, we're going to see these shares break through all existing barriers.TSLA's latest tests of the ""Enhanced Autopilot"" system indicate that self-driving cars could start crowding into public highways by 2020, which gives TSLA fans another long game to play once Model 3 hits the market.And with executives at would-be competitor Faraday Future bailing out, it looks like the Model Y has a better shot than ever at hitting the road first and claiming the electric SUV category for itself. When that day finally comes, TSLA investors will be in for a very profitable ride.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

In July 2016, the company held the official opening of the partly-constructed Gigafactory as per plan.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Has Nothing to Fear From Faraday Future;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the big reveals at this year's Consumer Electronics Show happened yesterday, before the show's official Jan. 5 open. And withTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock down 1.5% today, are Tesla's shareholders getting the heebie-jeebies?Source: Faraday FutureFaradayFuture, the mysterious electric car startup thatshowed off a non-functional concept carat last year's show was back.makeArticleAd();This time the company had the Faraday Future FF 91, a working, ultra-fast electric car that demonstrated its autonomous parking capability, while boasting a slew of class-leading features.Faraday Future FF 91At CES 2017, Faraday Future showed off its newFF 91 electric vehicle. One prototype was shown parking itself in downtown Las Vegas via a live video feed. A second unit onstage performed a similar stunt.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe vehicle packsan incredible 1,050 horsepowerin its electric motors with high-density battery packs good for a class-leading 378-mile range. Bluetooth integration, a smartphone app and facial recognition cameras are key to everything from opening the doors to learning driver preferences.The Faraday Future FF 91 is equipped with more than 30 advanced sensors for autonomous driving, including cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors and a retractable Lidar unit.Taking Aim at TeslaThe comparisons to Tesla and its current line-up of premium electric vehicles showed that Faraday Future is hoping to steal some thunder - and some customers.Faraday Future claims its new car has the densest battery pack available, with 130 kilowatt-hours of energy. Tesla meanwhile, just introduced a 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack in August, an optional upgrade to the 90 kilowatt-hour pack offered with the Model S starting in 2015. The higher density battery pack means the Faraday Future FF 91 gets superior range (378 miles compared to 315 miles for the Tesla) and faster speed. Faraday is also promising wireless charging is coming at some point.The Faraday Future FF 91 was pitted directly against a Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X in a race (which concluded offstage and wasn't independently verified). The Faraday Future FF 91 won,boasting a supposed new production car speed recordof 0 to 60 mph, at 2.39 seconds.Should Tesla be Worried?The Faraday Future FF 91 was at least a working automobile - unlike last year's stationary display model - but it's not quite ready for prime time.There were glitches, including an embarrassing moment whenthe car refused to start moving on stageduring a self-parking demonstration.Jalopnikalso noted assembly flaws and a reluctance to show the interior of the car,signs that the Faraday Future FF 91 isn't yet production-ready.Then there is the disastrous state of the company itself, described in a feature article inThe Vergeas""an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse.""If the company survives to begin production, asBusiness Insiderpointed out last year, the mere existence of Faraday Future can be seen as a boost to TSLA byadding to the electric car momentum. Additional players increase the odds that the overall electric car industry will survive its startup phase and thrive, something that is obviously good for Tesla. And from the appearances of the Faraday Future FF 91, the company is currently aiming at a premium market, while Tesla is pinning its future on mass production of the affordable Model 3.Car lovers with deep pockets can nowreserve an FF 91 for $5,000- and yes, the deposit is refundable should things not work out.

As Calpers Flails, Don’t Bank on Your Pension;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMillions of Americans are partially or wholly banking on some form of pension funds for retirement, whether they they work for a large corporation, a municipality or a given state. The problem is that many of these pensions - such as Calpers, which is the pension and health benefits system for well more than a million of California's public employees - are underfunded.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhat's ""underfunded"" mean, exactly? It means many of these pension funds do not have adequate assets to pay out the full 100% of benefits due to their workers for the entire period of time they are projected to have to do so.That means that all government workers need to be aware that they cannot, and should not, assume their pension funds will provide for them in retirement.Instead, you need to have alternative plans in place, and that means investing on your own right now. Start learning the basics, and start setting money aside. (Andsign up for a stock advisory newsletter like The Liberty Portfolio, which I'll be launching shortly.)Calpers - the California Public Employees' Retirement System - has been in the news quite a bit this past year. Andbecause it is only 76% funded, it is a clarion call to government workers to wake up before it's too late. As theNew York Timesreports. Calpers is ""considering cutting its investment return assumption.""Ya think?The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New YearIn 2012, it cut the assumption by 0.25% to 7.5% annually, while returning 5.1% annually over the past 10 years, according to theNY Times. Last week, itdropped the expected returnsto 7%. Along with it, Calpers is monkeying around with what higher rates local governments are going to have to pay to get the $139 billion unfunded liability to go down. Employers may face a 30% to 40% increase in payments. That's just insane, because that money means more tax increases.Let's face it: Getting the unfunded liabilities down to zero will never happen. It's like any government program - once the debt or unfunded portion gets past a certain point, the ship has begun taking on water.So what can middle-aged employees do to anticipate a reduced pension payout?Invest.Investing on Your OwnThe investment approach will need to be different from that of the Calpers fund. Page 99 of the its financial report shows that ""your"" money is alreadyspread around many of the top equity namesalready:Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Johnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) andAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T), just to name the top five.Without seeing a complete set of portfolio holdings, it is difficult to say where I think Calpers is underweighted inappropriately. However, considering the overall returns of the fund compared to theS&P 500 Indexand other benchmarks, it sure looks poorly managed overall.I tend to believe that most funds and managers are underweighted in value stocks, small caps and in preferred stocks. I think most are vastly overweighted, and wrongly so, in bonds. Preferred stocks and baby bonds (also known as exchange-traded debt) offer higher yields with comparable risk to government bonds.So what might be the best strategy if you are a Calpers pensioner? The first thing you need is more complete information.Go ahead and order the complete set of holdings. Hopefully they will break down the asset allocation in that filing. Asset allocation is crucial, because if you are middle-aged, getting the right balance is key. As for what actually is the right balance, that's something you have to decide yourself based on your risk profile. There are many ways of determining that.We certainly know that you need not invest in large cap stocks like AAPL, XOM, MSFT and the familiar names. No, my guess is you'll need small-cap value and growth names, or exchange-traded funds for that exposure. You'll need individual preferred stocks, which I think are better than the ETFs offered, and which I will discuss inThe Liberty Portfolio.The Dirty Secret to Trading Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) StockThese equity names and ETFs will expose you to a bit more risk, but I don't think you need to plow tons of capital into those names. I think that otherwise, prudent choices in preferred stocks, baby bonds and some real estate investment trusts should pay off over the long term.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Nothing Can Stop the Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Freight Train;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough many analysts are putting aqualified success anglefor this year's retail holiday season, there's no hiding the ugly truth - retail stocks are languishing.Source: ShutterstockSure, the Black Friday weekend got off to agreat start, but that has much to do with stores opening on Thanksgiving Day.makeArticleAd();Brick-and-mortar retailers are still finding it difficult to attract shoppers. The one bright spot is e-commerce. Unfortunately for everyone else, that is a domain becoming increasingly swallowed up byAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).A cursory look at major retail stocks gives you all the info you need to know. Shares ofWal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) have given up a significant portion of their post-election rallies.For the month of December, WMT slipped 1% below parity, while TGT fell by more than 7%. And it wasn't just discount retailers, either. High-end names such asNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) andWilliams Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) have absorbed horrible losses in the markets.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryEven AMZN stock was not immune from the pain. Since closing at an all-time high in early October, Amazon stock has given up more than 11%. Worse yet, shares didn't seem to gain much traction. While AMZN closed out the year up 11%, that may be little comfort to those who are assessing the nearer-term momentum. AMZN stock has been sandwiched between its 50- and 200-day moving averages for some time, suggesting pensiveness among the bulls.A Challenging Environment for AMZN StockI think anybody can appreciate the lack of confidence toward AMZN stock. Wall Street is about making profits, not pontificating about prior achievements. If there's one thing that can disrupt Amazon stock, it would be declining consumer sentiment. To that end,reduced advertisementsby retailers is a worrisome sign.Click to EnlargeThis is where hard data can help distinguish between either a natural correction for AMZN stock, or something more permanent. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce is anunstoppable force.In the six years from 2000 through the end of 2005, online retail sales totaled $326.6 million. In last year alone, that figure jumped to $341.5 million. By default, this just feeds into the Amazon stock machine.But more so than the raw numbers, the growth rate in online retailing continues to impress. Of course, nothing will come close to the nascent years of e-commerce. In the 2000s, online sales grew annually by 21%. But over the past six years, the growth rate is still a robust 15%. Since all indications point to a superior performance in the fourth quarter of 2016, that rate is only going higher.This is simply great news for AMZN stock. Admittedly, though, its success is coming at great cost to the overall industry. Whiletotal retailsales exclusive of food services is a massive entity, the percentage of shoppers doing business online is skewing unfavorably for the brick-and-mortars.A prime example is the immediate fallout from the Great Recession. Retail overall saw negative growth in 2008 and 2009, particularly seriously during the latter. In contrast, e-commerce growth was hit hard, but never dipped into the red thanks to companies like AMZN. In addition, aggregate retail sales this decade average an anemic 4.5%.Amazon Demonstrates Why It's the BestI think we also need to acknowledge another basic reality - AMZN is a freak of nature. Despite difficult circumstances for its land-based competitors, the e-commerce giant finds new ways to leap above the fray. Case in point is the more thanone billion productsthat were pushed out the door due to its Prime and Fulfillment services. That has to be a major letdown for Amazon stock competitors, who are trying to find some way of remotely keeping pace.An even greater challenge is addressing the in-house sales that the Seattle-based company generates. Demand for the Echo speakers that are an accessory to Amazon's Alexa voice recognition software jumped nine fold from last year's holiday season. According to their senior management team, the Echo was flying off the shelf despite a significant boost in production. If there's just one reason to buy AMZN stock, that might be it.Finally, the most impressive element of the organization is that they haven't lost their hunger for innovation.Amazon Go- the firm's foray into the ultra-competitive grocery sector - is nothing short of astonishing. Layered with consumer-centric technologies that represents a paradigm shift in shopping, AMZN takes integration to a new level. Thus, an investment in AMZN stock is an investment into the future.The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a     Make-or-Break StrategyI can only come to one conclusion. Amazon stock is as sure of a long-term bet as anything else in the markets. Not only is it dominating its own industry, AMZN is disrupting others. It is both retailer and producer - and it does both things amazingly well.Finally, it has enough moxie and leverage to compete in utterly foreign sectors. Again, there's nothing out there quite like AMZN stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe postNothing Can Stop the Amazon.com, Inc.

GoPro Inc (GPRO) Announces Karma Drone Re-Launch in 2017;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCES 2017 is in full swing and many tech companies are there showing off their new gear. Some are using the event and its concentration of journalists to explain what went wrong last year and what their plans are to make things right.GoProInc(NASDAQ:GPRO) is in the latter camp.Click to EnlargeSource: GoProThe company chose the Consumer Electronics Show to announce it will re-launch the GoPro Karma drone in 2017.makeArticleAd();GoPro was one of the top tech news stories of 2016, but not in a good way. Seeking to diversify beyond action cameras, GPRO released the GoPro Karma, its first entry in the drone market. However the the Karma dronewas a disaster from the start, despite an innovative folding design.The release itself was months later than expected. And once the Karma drone was officially unveiled,DJI- the Chinese company that leads the consumer drone market - announced a compact folding drone of its own.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryThe DJI Mavic included a 4K camera while costing the same as the entry-level GoPro Karma (which did not include a camera), effectively undercutting its price by several hundred dollars. Adding insult to injury, the DJI Mavic was availablebeforethe GoPro Karma could hit store shelves.Then things went from bad to worse for GPRO. The GoPro Karma drones it did sell starting in September began falling out of the sky. This forced the company to recall the Karma drone.GPRO Stock Takes a BeatingGoing into the holiday shopping season, GPRO was facing a PR issue with its recalled Karma drone. It had no drones to sell, leaving consumers looking for big-ticket, high-tech gifts to buy the DJI Mavic instead.Following the Karma recall, the company was forced tolay off 200 employees(15% of its staff) and the company's president left amid the restructuring. Earnings were missed - badly - and GoPro stock took a beating.The company desperately needs some good news to kick off 2017.GoPro Karma Will Re-Launch in 2017Rather than demonstrate new products at the Consumer Electronics Show, GPRO is there ""demonstrating recent product breakthroughs."" The biggest breakthrough of all for the company is a resolution to the Karma drone crisis.GoPro chose CES 2017 to announce it willre-launch the Karma drone in 2017. According to GoPro, the issue that brought its drones out of the sky has been identified as ""power loss due to a mechanical issue related to securing the drone's battery.""GoPro says it has fixed the design flaw and is currently finishing up testing. It says further details will be provided in February outlining the plans for the GoPro Karma worldwide re-launch.2016 was not a great year for GPRO. Demand for action cameras softened even as additional competitors entered the market and smartphones began to emerge as a threat:Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) released a water-resistant iPhone 7 that could shoot 4K video and 120 frames per second slow motion 1080p video. There were manufacturing challenges with its new Hero5 camera and the Karma drone recall capped things off. After the dust settled, GoPro stock shed over 50% of its value in 2016.However, GPRO was able to sell the Karma Grip (handheld camera stabilizer) component of the Karma drone separately in time for Christmas, and the company reportedGoPro camera sales up 35% on Black Fridaycompared to the previous year.If it is able to successfully re-launch the GoPro Karma in 2017 it will have missed out on the 2016 holiday shopping season, but will have most of the year to build up sales and recognition leading into next Christmas.The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a     Make-or-Break StrategySince announcing the Karma drone re-launch, GoPro stock is up over 2.5%, reflecting the possibility that the company is finally putting a terrible 2016 behind it.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCES 2017: The Hottest Headlines From Media Day     13 Things Apple Inc.

Why Tesla Motors, Inc. Stock Soared in December;1/5/2017;"What happenedShares of electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) soared 17.5% in December, according to data   provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock's rise helped it recover some of its pullback earlier   in the year.The Tesla Model S. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();So whatThere's no surefire reason for Tesla's 17.5% gain during the   month, but one did stand out as the most likely catalyst for at   least a portion of the gain.Tesla stockhad pulled back in the weeks following the U.S. presidential   election, perhaps because investors were concerned about how   Tesla could be impacted during Trump's time as president. Trump   has expressed disbelief about global warming and outlined actions   for eliminating some government spending related to climate   change. But sentiment about how Tesla might fare with Trump as   president turned rosier when the president-elect startedcozying up to Elon Musk. Trump invited the Tesla CEO to his tech summit meeting in New   York City, and even appointed him to his Strategic and Policy   Forum.So, Tesla stock may have simply rebounded in December from a   sell-off spurred by an overreaction to Trump's election. Of   course, there were probably other factors driving the rebound,   such as theS&P 500's overall 2% gain during this period, but Trump's warming up to   Musk was likely one of the main catalysts for Tesla stock during   the month.Now whatInvestors shouldn't read too much into month-to-month moves   like this, but it is notable to see Trump keeping Musk close to   his side. Still, investors may want to keep an eye on any   political action during Trump's presidency that could impact   Tesla.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Just Showed Why It Still Has More Room to Run in 2017;1/5/2017;"Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining nearly 300%. As a result, nearly every portfolio manager and analyst is positive on the company, as its GPUs go into everything from artificial intelligence to machine learning to driverless cars.After Wednesday's CES 2017 keynote address by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, Wall Street might not be bullish enough.In awide rangingkeynote address that kicked off the annual consumer electronics extravaganza in Las Vegas that touched on everything Nvidia is doing, Huang had something for all of its partners, its investors and the media that covers the company.makeArticleAd();Perhaps the most impressive announcement was the ability to have high-powered gaming in the cloud, effectively making any PC or Mac a high-powered gaming machine that can run the latest and greatest video games. Bringing gaming to the Mac with GeForce Now, its cloud gaming service, should open a huge new market for Nvidia. Apple's Macs have traditionally never been good for gaming, which is the only area of the PC market that's experiencing growth, so this is a coup for Nvidia.At $25 for 20 hours of gaming, it's a lot cheaper than plunking down $1,500 or $2,000 on an expensive gaming machine, especially if your existing PC or Mac is suitable enough for the rest of your computing needs.This presents a huge opportunity for Nvidia. Right now, there are around 100 million high-end gaming PCs out there. With this announcement, the opportunity went up nearly 20 fold. ""From a [total addressable market] perspective, the company is targeting emerging markets which addresses a 2.8B population (ages 18-40),"" RBC Capital Markets analysts led by Mitch Steves wrote in a research note following the speech.If that wasn't enough, the company's major announcement of a partnership with Audi to have driverless cars on the road by 2020 should whet investor's proverbial whistles.In addition, Huang showed off Nvidia's new AI Car Platform, which it wants every car-manufacturer to use. Currently, Tesla (TSLA) isusingNvidia's chips for its self-driving system and we can expect many more car-makers to do the same thanks to Nvidia making it easier with its AI Car Platform.Automotive could be a bigger opportunity for Nvidia than gaming, thanks to the opportunities in the digital cockpit (which represents a 20 million car or $2 billion opportunity per Steves), self-driving cars (15 million or $2 billion) and transportation-as-a-service (2 million or $2-$6 billion. Self-driving cars are coming and they're coming fast, all thanks to the computing power and artificial intelligence prowess that Nvidia's GPUs can handle.There were several more announcements, including the smart home, but none of this is possible without the boom we've seen over the past couple of years in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Andreessen Horowitz analyst Benedict Evans has tweeted that the ""Age of the GPU"" started in 2015 and Nvidia is capturing every opportunity it can in these arenas.With a presentation spanning nearly two hours and covering every white-hot topic in Silicon Valley, Huang showed off why Nvidia's GPUs are the apple of Silicon Valley's eye (pun intended) and will be for years to come."

The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a Make-or-Break Strategy;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe new year is shaping up to be a make-or-break year for electric vehicle innovatorTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). That's because we finally get to see whether CEO Elon Musk's vision of a fully integrated clean-energy company - spanning production, storage and end-use of renewable energy - can come to fruition. Needless to say, TSLA stock holders will be watching with eyes as wide as dinner plates.Source:OnInnovation via FlickrLast year, the major piece of the puzzle was the bailout buyout of fellow Musk company,SolarCity. That deal will supposedly tuck in the generation part of the plan.makeArticleAd();But right now, the story is all about storage. Tesla finally flipped the switch on its massive battery production facility - dubbed the Gigafactory.Without it, there's no way Tesla Motors can deliver on its lofty long-term goals. Nor can the company support the lofty price on TSLA stock, either.The Gigafactory not just a battery farm. It's a critical piece of the Tesla Motors story.Tesla's Big Plans for Its Big GigafactoryLithium batteries make the world go 'round. Storage of energy is a key component in basically everything, from solar panels to your smartphone. And lithium battery production has long been dominated by Japan, China, and other southeast Asian nations;roughly 88%of the world's battery production comes from the region.Tesla's problem is an ambitious goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles in 2018 … which will take a ton of lithium batteries. Current production isn't up to snuff, by alot. There's a significant shortfall.Like most Elon Musk solutions, Tesla's fix for its battery problem is a large one.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryA few years ago, TSLA partnered withPanasonic Corporation (ADR)(OTCMKTS:PCRFY) and started construction on a massive plant in the Nevada desert. The dubbed Gigafactory would design and build the needed batteries to arm itself - and potentially other vehicle makers, electrics firms and others - with the needed batteries to store energy. Over the spring, Musk and TSLA predicted that the facility would be able to crank outnearly 50 gigawatts worth of production by 2018- more than the world currently produces.On Wednesday, Tesla Motors turned on the third of the Gigafactory that is completed and started production of batteries.The Gigafactory Is CriticalThe Gigafactory's launch is a significant moment for TSLA stock, because it will help determine Tesla's ability to survive, and how healthy that survival will look.Without the Gigafactory, Tesla simply can't deliver on its EV production goals. The rest of the world does not make enough batteries, period. Plus, a lack of supply leads to another issue: affordability. The Model 3 is supposed to be an electric car for the masses that takes Tesla Motors from a hobby car for the rich to a staple for your average Joe.But current battery prices are too high to make the $35,000 vehicle profitable. And despite its cult stock following, Tesla still is a publicly traded company, and TSLA stock holders will increasingly demand profits.By building its batteries in-house, Tesla should be able to drive down costs for the critical component and make the Model 3 a profitable endeavor. One would hope so, considering that TSLA took out around$5 billion in debtto build the facility.Equally as important is TSLA's other plans for the facility. Musk & Co. are planning on building battery packs for energy storage from renewables and other sources. That includes its Powerwall and Powerpack batteries that store energy from its SolarCity and utility customers.This is a double-edged sword.Macy's Inc (M) Stock Plunges on Disastrous     Holiday Sales, Job CutsEven amid a shortfall in batteries, battery prices tanked last year. According toBloomberg's New Energy Finance unit, prices for lithium batteries sank by 22% in 2016 and are estimated to fall by another 15% this year. That's great for Model 3 profits and sales to utility customers, but not great for its actual battery production arm. If Tesla plans on selling its battery packs outside its doors - and it does based on its estimated production size and recent deals - then it needs to find the perfect price in the middle. Not too hot and not too cold.That needs to happen soon, too. The first things rolling off the Gigafactory line are storage batteries, not vehicle packs.This Is Everything to TSLA StockTesla's Gigafactory is a much-needed gamble. Without it, Musk can't achieve his vision of having an integrated clean energy company. Tesla will never be able to sell enough cars cost-effectively, get solar panels on everyone's roofs and provide energy storage for larger utility companies.Obviously, if it can't do that, TSLA stock is sunk. Tesla Motors already had enough mishaps on its own without SolarCity and the Gigafactory weighing it down under certain worse- and worst-case scenarios.Thus, the Gigafactory is a make-or-break strategy in a make-or-break year for Tesla Motors. If Tesla's past is any indication, things won't go perfectly smoothly - but they must go at least somewhat according to plan to keep TSLA from hurtling toward the earth.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Growth Stocks Set to Pop in 2017The 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to OwnThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe postThe Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Gigafactory Is a Make-or-Break Strategyappeared first onInvestorPlace."

(BAC)Ahead of the open next Friday, Bank of America will slip into the earnings confessional. Analysts are expecting a profit of 38 cents per share on revenue of $20.99 billion - up 40% and 7.3% year-over-year, respectively. Expectations appear to be a bit higher, however, asEarningsWhispers.comreports a whisper number of 39 cents per share for BofA earnings.5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryOptions traders are also quite bullish on BAC stock. During Wednesday's trading, speculative traders pushed more than 673,000 contracts across the tape on BAC, with calls gobbling up 73% of the day's take.

But that data was overshadowed by Tesla's analyst day tour of its new gigafactory, which has nowbegun production. In response, analysts at Guggenheim initiated coverage on TSLA stock with a ""buy"" rating.Despite the wealth of bullish data, options traders appeared to focus more on deliveries, as calls only accounted for about 53% of the more than 331,000 contracts traded on TSLA yesterday. With Guggenheim providing thesecond such bullish research notein the past two weeks, something's got to give in TSLA's options backdrop sooner or later, especially with the shares closing in on heavy January 2017 call OI at the $230 strike.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Indeed, if anything,   shareholders might have been happy to see production increasing   -- even if the company is underperforming its own ambitious   growth targets.Tesla stockwas up about 5% in late afternoon trading Wednesday.So, why is it that investors still seem pleased with Tesla's   recent performance, despite the company missing its own   targets?makeArticleAd();Tesla store. Image source: The Motley Fool.Small misses on increasingly bigger targetsFor its fourth quarter, Tesla delivered about 22,200 vehicles,   the company announced earlier this week. This put its total   deliveries for 2016 at 76,230 -- 3,770 vehicles below the bottom   of Tesla's initial full-year guidance range of  80,000 to   90,000 deliveries.Bad news right? Not necessarily. The narrative looks a bit   more optimistic when investors consider that Tesla delivered   under 50,700 vehicles in 2015. Its 2016 deliveries, therefore,   are up a notable 51% year over year.In a sense, the market seems to have gotten used to   Tesla's habit -- whether it's on purpose or not -- of   missing its big growth targets. And it's arguably becoming easier   to forgive the company given that it's still growing at a   blistering rate.To put Tesla's small misses into perspective, consider this   table of the company's actual annual deliveries versus initial   annual guidance for full-year vehicle deliveries during each   period.YearInitial GuidanceActual Vehicle DeliveriesDifference201320,00022,44212.2%201435,00031,655(9.6%)201555,00050,658(4.3%)201680,000-90,00076,230(10.3%)*Total195,000*180,985(7.2%)*Data from SEC filings and Tesla's quarterly press releases for   vehicle deliveries. * indicates a figure based on a guidance   range midpoint.Tesla is definitely underperforming its targets, but it's   still ramping up deliveries every year at consistently rapid   rates.Production, deliveries, and demand are soaringFurther, several metrics about Tesla's recent growth give   investors reason to be hopeful about the company's growth   trajectory. Consider some of these tidbits:It has increased deliveries at a rate of 41% or higher     during each of the last four years, with deliveries increasing     51% year-over-year in 2016.Data for chart based on SEC filings and Tesla's quarterly   press releases for vehicle deliveries. Chart source: author.Vehicle production in 2016 was up 64% year over year. (The     difference in delivery growth and production growth reflects     vehicles still in transit to customers at the end of Q4.)Demand is increasing sharply, with Q4 net orders for the     Model S and Model X at a record high, up 52% year over year and     24% sequentially.This recent growth, of course, still isn't quite enough to   eliminate watchers' well-justified skepticism toward the   company's ambitious target of achieving an annualized production   rate of 500,000 vehicles in 2018 with the help of the company's   planned Model 3 launch later this year. But when considering both   Tesla's recent growth and its estimated 400,000 deposit-backed   reservations for the lower-cost Model 3, it's definitely   beginning to look like the company could build and sell several   hundred thousand vehicles in 2018 -- and 500,000 doesn't sound as   crazy as it used to.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Options Traders Expect Huge Moves in Tesla (TSLA) Stock;1/5/2017;"Investors in Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAneed to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the January 20th, 2017 $50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together anoptions tradingstrategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Tesla shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Tesla is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Automotive - Domestic industry that ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 56 cents per share to a loss of 72 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Tesla right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

The Simple Reason I Won't Buy Tesla Motors Stock;1/4/2017;"Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Image source:OnInnovationvia Flickr. Copyright 2010 The Henry Ford. Republished underCC BY-ND 2.0.There is a simple reason I won't buy shares ofTesla Motors Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) : I don't trust founder-CEO Elon Musk.Let me explain. It's not that I think Musk is fundamentally   dishonest, but rather that his grand unifying vision for his   company has blinded him to his responsibility to minority   shareholders and to the risks he is asking them to bear. The   Tesla Motorsacquisition-rescueof SolarCity Corp. is all the evidence I need to support that   proposition.makeArticleAd();In a deal with as much potential for conflict of interest as   this one, I think Musk had a personal obligation to spell out the   enormous risks associated with the acquisition in a clear and   forthright manner, instead of letting the lawyers address them in   legalese in the pages of a securities filing. He didn't.A tangled webIf you're reading this article, I assume you're probably   familiar with the conflicts of interest I refer to above, but let   me recap the most obvious ones for those readers who aren't:Musk is the co-founder, chief executive, chairman and     largest shareholder of electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors,     with a 20.8% stake.Musk was also the chairman and largest shareholder of solar     power system manufacturer SolarCity.Lyndon Rive, SolarCity's then-CEO and board member, is     Musk's cousin. Rive's co-founder, his brother Peter Rive, was     SolarCity's chief technology officer and a board member.Allow me to draw on one of the lessons that 50 years of   stewardship ofBerkshire Hathawaytaught CEO Warren Buffett. As he wrote in his golden anniversary   annual letter (emphasis mine):Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of     Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose earnings were     destined to simply limp along.Mistakes of that kind are deadly... Too often CEOs seem blind to an elementary reality: The     intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must     not be greater than the intrinsic value of the business you     receive.A losing exchangeTesla gave away 0.11 of its shares for every SolarCity share.   Here is what I think they received in return, in terms of   intrinsic value: zero. That's what I think SolarCity is worth as   a going concern. It isn't profitable, either under GAAP   (generally accepted accounting principles) or on a cash basis.   The most recent estimates have SolarCity recording an accounting   loss of close to a billion dollars in 2017, following an   estimated $925 million loss in 2016.By the end of the third quarter of 2016, SolarCity's cash had   declined to $259 million from $373 million 12 months prior --   despite having issued debt and equity totaling $849 million (net   basis) over that period. Yet Teslatouted as a financial benefitof the acquisition that it ""is expected to be additive to Tesla's   cash balance... We expect SolarCity to add more than half a   billion dollars in cash to Tesla's balance sheet over the next 3   years."" Here's to wishing!Apparently, I'm not the only with genuine skepticism regarding   the equity value Tesla shareholders received in acquiring   SolarCity. In themerger proposalit filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 31,   Tesla revealed thatfifteeninstitutional investors had passed on acquiring SolarCity or even   simply making an equity investment in it, and that the company   was facing a liquidity squeeze. On its most recent financials,   the company's Altman Z-score of -0.20 indicated a significant   risk of bankruptcy.""[A] match made in market heaven""With the acquisition by Tesla, SolarCity has found a lifeline   such that financial distress is no longer imminent. However, to   justify the acquisition on any basis other than as a rescue   operation, you have to buy into Musk's vision of the rich   synergies between the two businesses. I don't. As New York   Universityfinance professor and valuation expert Aswath Damodaranwrotein September:I don't think that Tesla's Solar City acquisition passes     [either] the smell test (for conflict of interest) [or] the     common sense test (of creating value), but I am not a     shareholder in either Tesla or Solar City and I don't get a     vote. When Tesla shareholders vote, given that owning the stock     is by itself an admission that they buy into the Musk vision, I     would not be surprised if they go along with his     recommendations. Tesla shareholders and Elon Musk are a match     made in market heaven and I wish them the best of luck in their     life together.(Note: Tesla shareholders approved the acquisition on Nov. 17,   and the deal closed five days later.)Like Damodaran, I'm not a Tesla shareholder. I respect Musk   for his entrepreneurial vision and for what he has achieved, but   there is a fine line between visionary drive in emerging   industries and recklessness. As far as I'm concerned, buying or   holding Tesla Motors shares at this point has more to do with   blind faith than investing.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Gold prices held on   to their recent gains, too, and that produced a 2% increase for   the always volatileDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT) .As for individual stocks,Weight Watchers(NYSE: WTW) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stood out with large price jumps even on a solid   day for broader indexes.Weight Watchers' brand glowWeight Watchers' stock gained 21% following two pieces of good   news for the brand. First, the companywon high marks in an annual diet-ranking   programperformed byU.S. News & World Report. The survey judged programs across categories like diabetes and   heart disease prevention, and easiness to follow. Weight Watchers   came in first within four categories, including ""Best Diet for   Fast Weight Loss.""Weight Watchers was tied for fourth-best overall, giving the   company good news to put in front of potential customers. ""We're   honored to be ranked at the highest level for seven straight   years by the experts atU.S. News & World Report,"" an executive said in a press release.Weight Watchers shares also appeared to benefit from news that   Oprah Winfrey, who recently took an ownership stake in the   company, is lending her considerable star power to promote the   brand. She gushed about the program on Tuesday, tellingThe Late Show's Stephen Colbert: ""Everybody who has watched me over the years   knows I've struggled with food. It's the first time that I've   gotten it under control.""The company has receivedsimilar endorsements by Oprah in the past, and it also routinely ranks well inU.S. News & World Report's surveys. It hasn't yet turned those branding wins into strong   membership and earnings growth, though. Revenue is down slightly   over the past nine months as operating income held flat at $150   million.Tesla deliveriesTesla shares jumped 4% after the electric-car makerupdated investorson its latest production and sales-output figures. The company   manufactured 24,882 vehicles in the fourth quarter despite   shifting to new autopilot hardware. Initial transition hiccups   meant that deliveries didn't quite meet expectations, though.   Tesla delivered 22,200 vehicles -- below the 25,000 goal -- in   the quarter, 12,700 of which were Model S, with the remaining   9,500 being Model X.Executives said that short-term production challenges were to   blame for the delivery shortfall. ""Although we tried to recover   these deliveries and expedite others by the end of the quarter,   time ran out before we could deliver all customer cars"" that had   been ordered, and in many cases, fully paid for. The 6,500   vehicles that were in transit when the clock ran out on the   quarter will count toward first-quarter deliveries.Image source: Tesla.Investors took that slight miss in their stride, choosing   instead to focus on Tesla's bullish reading of the market in a   quarter that included a 52% spike in order volume.

Why Tesla Motors' Guidance Misses Should Concern Investors;1/4/2017;"Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) said that it delivered about 22,200 vehicles in   the fourth quarter of 2016, a number that left it short of its   own guidance for both the quarter and the full year.It's far from the first time that Tesla has missed its own   guidance, of course. Investors appeared to take this latest   shortfall in stride. But the trend suggests that Tesla might miss   some key deadlines, and that could have much more serious   consequences for the stock.""Short-term production challenges""Tesla's guidance had called for ""just over 25,000"" deliveries   in the fourth quarter and at least 80,000 for the full year. But   its fourth-quarter shortfall left its tally for the full year at   76,230 vehicles delivered to customers.makeArticleAd();Now in its fifth year of production, Tesla's Model S may be   facing declining demand. Image source: Tesla Motors.In a statement late on Tuesday, Tesla said that ""short-term   production challenges starting at the end of October and lasting   through early December"" left it scrambling to make up lost   production late in the quarter.Tesla blamed the ""challenges"" on its transaction to install   new hardware for its Autopilot driver-assist system. The company   said on October 19 that it would begin shipping all of its new   vehicles with thehardware necessary for fully autonomous   driving, allowing it to gradually enable self-driving capabilities in   those cars with software updates over time.Tesla last reaffirmed its fourth-quarter guidance in a   shareholder letter on October 26. Apparently, the ""production   challenges"" started in the days immediately following the   letter.Another in a long list of missed goalsTesla has a long history of missing its own targets, whether   for sales totals, profits, or the timing of key product-related   events. CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged that the company sometimes   falls short, saying that he sets ambitious goals for the company   as a way to motivate employees and suppliers.That may work, but it makes it challenging for investors to   evaluate the company's stated business plans. Musk has said that   Tesla will begin production of its compact Model 3 sedan sometime   in 2017, but many analysts feel that's unlikely.In a note on Tuesday before Tesla announced its delivery   totals,Barclaysauto analyst Brian Johnson said that there's a high probability   that the company won't be able to deliver any Model 3s in   2017.Why Tesla's routine misses could eventually be trouble for   the stockViewed in the context of its past results, Tesla's 2016   delivery total is impressive even if it fell short of Musk's   goal. But it's still far short of the hundreds of thousands -- or   millions -- of annual deliveries that Tesla will need to be a   viable automaker over the long term.Tesla has said that it has nearly 400,000 preorders for the   Model 3. But more and more big automakers are announcing plans to   bring long-range electric vehicles to market over the next few   years. (Just yesterday,Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) said that it will begin production of anelectric SUV with 300 miles of rangeby 2020.)If the Model 3 is delayed, which seems likely given Tesla's   history, that could mean that those orders won't be filled until   late 2018 or 2019. How many of those customers will give up and   choose an electric vehicle from a major automaker instead?Tesla had a significant technological advantage over the big   automakers when it first launched the Model S in 2012. But the   risk to Tesla as an investment has always been that the big   automakers might close the electric-vehicle technology gapbefore Tesla can get to sustainable scale, leaving the upstart Silicon Valley automaker in an uphill   battle for market share against better-funded competition.That risk could become reality if the Model 3 is delayed   significantly. Tesla has built a great brand and the Model 3   will find buyers no matter what happens. But the longer it waits,   the harder it will be for Tesla to ramp up to the millions of   deliveries a year that it will need to support its current   sky-high valuation.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla's Gigafactory Doubles in Size, Brings Battery Cell Production to U.S.;1/4/2017;"When ItouredTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) Gigafactory in July, it was  already a   massive structure. With an 800,000-square-foot footprint and 1.9   million square feet of manufacturing space when including the   building's several levels, the factory would take hours to walk   through. Even more, the company had already tooled significant   portions of the factory and had begun streamlining production of   Tesla Energy packs (the cells used in the packs were still made   in Japan).Tesla's Gigafactory (with Model 3 sitting outside) when I   visited last July. Image source: author.makeArticleAd();But a tour of the Gigafactory today would reveal some massive   changes. First, in less than six months, the building's total   footprint has doubled to 1.9 million square feet and its   operational square feet is 2.6 times what it was, at 4.9 million   square feet. Second -- and perhaps more important for Tesla's   business -- the company has already begun mass production of   lithium-ion battery cells at the factory.Building battery cells""Today at the Gigafactory, Tesla and Panasonic began mass   production of lithium-ion battery cells,"" Tesla announced in a   blog post on Wednesday.Tesla said it will be mass producing its new high-performance   cylindrical ""2170 cell,"" which CEO Elon Musk has said is both the   highest energy density cell in the world and is also the   cheapest.Production of battery cells for qualification purposes started   at the Gigafactory last month, the company said.

Image source: Tesla   Motors.The beginning of cell production at Tesla's Gigafactory is   good news for investors. With Tesla planning to launch its   lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3 in the second half of 2017, the   company will need Gigafactory-based cell production both for its   lower cell costs and its higher-volume cell production.Model 3 will likely be the most American-made     carOne interesting takeaway from this news is that by bringing   cell production to the U.S., Model 3 will likely become the   world's most American-made vehicle. After Tesla brings cell   production from Japan to the U.S. for its vehicles, the   percentage of content in its vehicles made in the U.S. could jump   from around 55% to around 90% -- a figure that would give Model 3   more American-made content than any other vehicle.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Furthermore, Tesla's narrative of U.S. job creation is   arguably an important factor as President-elect Donald Trump   takes office. Tesla's emphasis on U.S. job creation will likely   resonate with one of the president's biggest priorities: boosting   U.S.-based manufacturing. Musk has said the Gigafactory will   directly employ around 10,000 people at peak production, and   Tesla estimates the factory will indirectly create between 20,000   to 30,000 additional jobs in surrounding regions.For Tesla, this is just the beginning. The company reminded   investors today that while Gigafactory construction has   progressed by leaps and bounds, the factory is less than 30%   done. Tesla's ambition for the factory is enormous. By 2018, it   plans to produce about 35 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion battery   cell capacity per year, or about as much as the rest of the   world's battery production combined today. And when the structure   is complete, the Gigafactory will be the biggest building in the   world measured by footprint.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

CES 2017: The Hottest Headlines From Media Day 1;1/4/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year's edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) doesn't officially start until Jan. 5, but tech companies spent yesterday showing off their latest products to the press.Source: AcerAmong the stars of CES 2017 so far are laptops featuringIntel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) new Kaby Lake processors, smart home devices and the appearance of an actual functioningFaraday Futureelectric car.makeArticleAd();Today, we look at the most exciting headlines from Big Tech's meetings with the press.CES 2017: New CPUs Advance Mobile and PC CapabilitiesFor a while there, computing ambition was being held back by the wait for new processors. Intel's new ""Kaby Lake"" CPUs were unveiled at CES 2017, and that's good news for the PC industry. These seventh-generation chips are expected to power everything from thelong-awaited new iMacfromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) to a new crop of VR-capable PCs and ultra-portable laptops.New computers were unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show that take advantage of the new Kaby Lake silicon, including a new convertible 2-in-1 version ofDell'spopularXPS 13 laptop. And in typical CES fashion, there was an over the top moment whenAcer Inc(OTCMKTS:ASIYF) took the wraps off thePredator 21-X: a $9,000-plus gaming ""laptop"" with a 21-inch curved display, Kaby Lake CPU, mechanical keyboard, dual graphics cards fromNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) and eye-tracking cameras.Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) also showed off its new Snapdragon 835 processor. You can expect to see the new flagship Snapdragon chip powering 2017's must-have Android smartphones.The Smart HomeMuch of CES 2017 has been focused on the smart home. That includes a flood of new mesh routers that aim to simplify home Wi-Fi and provide the wireless coverage need for smart homes to function effectively. They'll be taking on the like ofAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently announced Google WiFi system.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) MUST Do to Soar in     2017Also featuring prominently were smart speakers. Google Home is gaining the ability to remote start supported cars fromHyundai Motor Co(OTCMKTS:HYMLF).Lenovo Group Limited(OTCMKTS:LNVGY) showed off anew smart speakerthat incorporatesAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa smart assistant - an Amazon Echo alternative that looks better and costs less than the Amazon Echo. There's also a premium audio version that will go for $179.Alphabet Soup! QLED 4K HDR TVsTVs always make the spotlight at the Consumer Electronics Show, and Day One of CES 2017 did not disappoint. The big trend is in big-screen, QLED 4K HDR TVs.What exactly do all those acronyms mean?QLED combines two of TV's bleeding edge display technologies: quantum dots and OLED. Together, you get a picture that's brighter, with the deep blacks and flexible panels of OLED, but at a much more affordable cost. 4K is the the same Ultra HD resolution that has become an expected feature of TVs. HDR is the high-dynamic-range picture that makes viewing pop. Throw those letters all together, and you get a new class of QLED 4K HDR TVs that offer the best showcase technology of the past few years in a single and relatively affordable package.Leading that charge to convince you to finally buy a new TV were the usual suspects, includingSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Although this year, Samsung avoided controversy by refusing to give out prices for its newflagship QLED TVs.CES 2017: Faraday FutureThe Consumer Electronics Show has increasingly been focused on cars. Automobiles are rapidly getting more advanced - electric power, autonomous capabilities and integration with smart tech like Apple Car Play or Amazon Alexa - so that makes sense.The big story on the auto front from CES 2017 was the Faraday Future FF 91, a high-performance electric car that hopes to take onTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). Although Faraday promised a Tesla-killer at last year's show, it only managed a non-functioning prototype.The Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone WAS the Most     Popular Smartphone, But…This year, the company kicked off CES 2017 with live demonstrations of its Faraday Future FF 91, showing its self-driving capabilities while bragging about new high-density battery packs and world-record speeds.All of this is just skimming the surface of what was announced on day one. Stay tuned for a wrap of CES 2017, where we'll spike out the big technology trends and top stories that develop over the course of the show.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSurface Hub is 2016's Stealth Hit for Microsoft     Corporation (MSFT)The Dirty Secret to Trading Tesla Motors Inc     (TSLA) StockThe postCES 2017: The Hottest Headlines From Media Day 1appeared first onInvestorPlace."

The Dirty Secret to Trading Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock;1/4/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'll get right into it - the dirty secret ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is that, despite all of the controversies and fanfare, TSLA stock has mostly been range-bound for the past three years.Source: ShutterstockIf you see a price below $200 per share as a buy signal, and a price near $250 as a sell signal, or even a sign to go short, you have been making money off Elon Musk right along. The turns in the stock's price are often sharp - it plunged from $240 to $150 about a year ago, then hit $250 again within two months - but they generally stay within the range.makeArticleAd();At the opening price of about $213.44, then, Tesla is clearly in ""meh"" territory. An uptrend has been in place for a month now, but if you jump in you're likely to see a reversal after a gain of about 10%.What's Up With TSLA Stock Now?The main problem for Teslaremains what it has always been, scaling production to meet the stock price's expectations.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearFor the third quarter in four for 2016,Tesla missed its production estimates, delivering just 22,200 cars. The original estimate for the year had been 80,000 to 90,000 cars. The final number was 76,230. That compares with50,580 for 2015, so 2016 production showed a more than 50% increase.Tesla continues to paint a rosy production picture, and CEO Elon Musk thinks it will deliver 800,000 cars next year. This will include the Model 3, a $35,000 unit on which 400,000 pre-orders (with $1,000 checks) were taken on its announcement.The cars are certain to be cool. The question is whether there will be enough of them to show a profit and please Wall Street.What If Musk Is Right?The production shortfall sent the shares down about $4, but they should go right back up today as the company offers investors a tour of its Sparks, Nevada battery""gigafactory,""hosted by Musk himself. The Nevada factory supplies batteries for Tesla cars and stand-alone PowerWalls that can store electricity produced by SolarCity solar panels.It is this production ramp-up that has both bulls and bears worried. If Tesla continues to fall short this year, the bears think the stock will collapseonce and for all. If it comes close to its goals then, adding in the Supercharging centers (on which it's finally going tostart making money this year), the PowerWalls and the solar panels, the thought is the bulls may run again.SolarCity, which Teslaformally acquired in November, was last year's reason to worry. The concern was that the solar panel maker would drag the whole company down with it. Since oil prices are now rising, SolarCity should soon see positive margins, especially as it's sold alongside other Tesla products, so that worry is passing.But whenever a worry passes with Tesla, a new worry replaces it. Maybe if Musk's production plans seem about to fail, he'll buy SpaceX. Or, if they seem about to succeed, he'll geta white Persian cat.Tesla Is a Trade and a TeaseFor analysts and reporters, Tesla is the gift that keeps on giving. In a black suit and blue tie world, Elon Musk and Tesla are a tie-dyed shirt. The story is always fun and always subject to change without notice.But beneath the hype, and the talk of imminent catastrophe or unlimited profit, lies this truth. Musk is building a real company, but he may never let the stock get out of its trading range, because once Tesla accomplishes a goal he will find it loftier goal that will worry analysts about his sanity, and that of his investors.Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the     Cure Is ComingThus, if you're going to get involved in Tesla shares, and I'm not recommending you do unless you like some manic-depression with your morning coffee, just watch the trading range. Get in when they're bearish, get out when they're bullish, and on days like today when it's in-between, just have a laugh.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

However, its own forecast was for a range of 80,000   to 90,000 cars. Said Tesla in a press release:""Our Q4 delivery count should be viewed as slightly   conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is   transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct.""When combining Q4's tally with the 24,500 vehicles in Q3,   Tesla also fell short of its half-year expectation for 50,000   vehicle deliveries.That said, Q4 still was an improvement over the previous year   by about 5,000 cars, and its production tally for 2016 was 64%   better year-over-year.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksWhile the initial reaction in TSLA stock was much more   violent, losses had pared their way down to about 1% of red ink   in Wednesday's early trade.Agile Therapeutics Inc (AGRX)AGRX shares were more than halved in Wednesday's premarket   trade, in addition to 12%-plus losses on Tuesday, following the   release of data from a study on the company's contraceptive   patch.Agile's Twirla contraceptive patch actually achieved positive   results, with the company's 13-cycle trial achieving a 4.8 rating   on subjects 35 years of age and under.

Tesla Misses Full-Year Vehicle Delivery Projections;1/3/2017;"Shares of Tesla MotorsTSLAfell in after-hours trading Tuesday following the company's Q4 and full-year vehicle delivery announcement. Tesla said that it delivered about 22,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter, bringing its total to 76,230 for the year, which missed estimates.The automaker said that ""short-term production challenges"" caused issues which weighted deliveries towards the end of the quarter and forced the company to miss its already-trimmed projections. Tesla delivered 12,700 Model S vehicles and 9,500 Model X vehicles in the quarter, and another 6,450 vehicles were in transit to customers are the end of the quarter.Tesla also highlighted the transition to new Autopilot hardware and some shipping challenges as difficulties in the quarter.In February, Tesla guided for deliveries of 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles in 2016, but that was later adjusted down to 79,000. The electric vehicle maker affirmed that guidance in October.Nevertheless, Tesla pointed out that vehicle demand in the quarter was strong, and net orders for the Model S and X were up 52% year-over-year.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Tesla Motors, Inc.'s Vehicle Deliveries Miss Guidance -- What Investors Should Know;1/3/2017;"Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quarter deliveries were below the   company's guidance, making it the third quarter during 2016 in   which the company missed its own target for vehicle deliveries.   The quarter's miss also put the company below its guidance for   the full year. Ahead of its planned Model 3 launch late this   year, another missed target does little to help investors have   faith in the company's much more ambitious goals for the upcoming   higher-volume, lower-cost car.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Another missTesla delivered about 22,200 vehicles during the quarter, the   company announced on Tuesday. The Model S accounted for 12,700   deliveries, and the Model X accounted for 9,500. This brought   total deliveries in 2016 to 76,230. Tesla had guided for ""just   over 25,000 deliveries"" during the fourth quarter. And management   had initially expected to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles in   2016 but ended up reducing its full-year guidance to about   79,000.Tesla explained the miss in a press release:Because of short-term production challenges starting at the     end of October and lasting through early December from the     transition to new Autopilot hardware, Q4 vehicle production was     weighted more heavily toward the end of the quarter than we had     originally planned. We were ultimately able to recover and hit     our production goal, but the delay in production resulted in     challenges that impacted quarterly deliveries, including, among     other things, cars missing shipping cutoffs for Europe and     Asia. Although we tried to recover these deliveries and     expedite others by the end of the quarter, time ran out before     we could deliver all customer cars.These deliveries are lower than the 24,821 units Tesla shipped   in Q3, but they were up 27% sequentially.The silver liningTo go along with Tesla's disappointing fourth-quarter   deliveries, the company gave investors a couple positive   takeaways from the quarter.First, production did pick up meaningfully during the quarter,   after the company addressed short-term production challenges.   Tesla was able to produce 24,822 vehicles in Q4, bringing total   2016 production to about 84,000 vehicles -- up an impressive 64%   from 2015. With production ramping steeply toward the end of the   company's fourth quarter, Tesla closed the year with a record   6,450 vehicles in transit to customers. These in-transit   deliveries will be delivered in the first quarter of 2017.Second, Tesla said demand during the quarter ""was particularly   strong."" Combined net orders for its Model S and X were 52%   higher than in the year-ago quarter and 24% higher than in   Tesla's third quarter of 2016.Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif. Image source: The Motley   Fool.Despite a quarter-end rebound in production and higher demand,   Tesla's extension of its poor track record with hitting targets   in 2016 shouldn't be overlooked. Consistently missing its own   targets, including management's initial and revised full-year   delivery targets and three of its quarterly guidance targets,   makes Tesla's plan to go from its current annualized production   run rate of 100,000 units to a target of 500,000 units in 2018   difficult to take seriously.On the other hand, investors could benefit from zooming out of   the quarter's results and look instead at how rapidly the company   was able to increase full-year production compared with 2016. A   64% year-over-year increase in production during 2016 helps   reinforce the company's ability to grow production at an uncanny   rate, and it bodes well for future growth. But a 500,000   annualize unit-build rate still seems speculative -- even if the   company has 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the Model 3.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Electric Minivan: A Huge Missed Opportunity;1/3/2017;"FCA's Chrysler Portal concept is a futuristic take on a   vehicle for families, but it's just for show. FCA has no plans to   build it. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE: FCAU) has released some information on the Chrysler Portal   concept car that it plans to unveil on Tuesday at the Consumer   Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.makeArticleAd();The Portal is a futuristic take on a highly connected electric   minivan. It's an intriguing idea. But it's also a huge missed   opportunity -- and a troubling sign for FCA investors.A potential Tesla competitor, if it were realFCA said that the Portal ""explores the possibility of what a   family transportation vehicle could look like."" It has some   self-driving capabilities, FCA said, and the ability to connect   to personal devices and ""the cloud"" in ways that will help to   keep the kids entertained on long (or not so long) trips.FCA said that the Portal has a battery-electric drivetrain   with 250 miles of range. Its battery packs are built into the   floor, in the style ofTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) . Fast-charging capability will be able to add 150   miles of range in about 20 minutes.Simply put, the Portal represents an intriguing and advanced   potential competitor to Tesla's Model X, one that could turn the   market for ""kid-hauler"" vehicles on its head.Or it would, if FCA planned to build it. But the Portal is   strictly a show car -- and that's the problem.This isn't the electric minivan FCA desperately needsHere's why it's a problem: The auto industry is changing   rapidly, but there are few signs that FCA is taking steps to keep   up. This show vehicle doesn't really change that, but an electric   vehicle intended for production might have.Right now, FCA has pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs and Hemi V8s,   along with a nice new minivan. (And, to be fair, a brand-new   hybrid version of that minivan.) They're popular products and   sales have been good. But with no hybrids or electric vehicles to   offset them and improve its corporate fuel-economy average, FCA   is headed for trouble.The Portal's dash is a show-car flight of fancy.

But it's lacking a range of hybrids and   a serious electric-car effort as fuel-economy rules tighten --   and that's going to be a big problem in a few years.The contrast with FCA's old Detroit rivals is instructive.General Motors(NYSE: GM) has a long-range electric carin productionand a massive effort under way to develop self-driving technology   in-house.Ford(NYSE: F) also has a big self-driving development effort under   way, along with a range of well-regarded hybrids and clear,   credible plans to add many more electrified vehicles over the   next few years. And both have made it clear that they are   grappling seriously with the larger technology-driven changes   coming to the business of autos.Chrysler wouldn't have missed this huge opportunity, but FCA   didNot all of the incumbent global automakers will be able to   make the leap into the not-too-distant electrified, self-driving,   ride-hailing future. Some will be displaced (or ""disrupted"") by   new entrants like Tesla and Waymo. It's a good bet that GM and   Ford will be important players in that future, because they're   taking the steps to get there now. FCA, which is struggling under   a huge debt load, hasn't kept up.A fully electric version of the Chrysler Pacifica would   have been a more impressive statement by FCA. Image source:   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.At several points in its long and checkered history, the old   Chrysler Corporation was able to dodge corporate death with a   brilliant new product at just the right moment. FCA had the   opportunity to do that today -- and frankly, when he heard that   an electric minivan was in the works, your humble Fool expected aclassic Chrysler masterstroke.Imagine if instead of a futuristic concept, FCA had shown a   long-range electric version of itscurrentminivan, the gorgeous Chrysler Pacifica -- and had announced   plans to put it into production. Sure, it might take a few years   and a huge internal effort to bring that vehicle to market, given   that FCA is starting from behind. But it would have the potential   to be the first electric vehicle that really connects with the   mass market: an electric minivan perfect for tech-savvy young   families.An electric Pacifica would have been a much more powerful   statement that FCA sees the future coming andplans to join itin bold style. Instead, it built a vehicle that is just for show,   with technology that might or might not actually exist. That also   makes a statement, and not a good one.10 stocks we like better than Fiat Chrysler     AutomobilesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

With many traders feeling   fresh after a long holiday break, January is set to kick off with   a bang this morning. U.S. stock futures are pointing toward sharp   gains across the board on Wall Street, with futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagegaining 0.76%,S&P 500futures up 0.79% andNasdaq-100futures rallying 0.83%.On the options front, volume was understandably anemic on Friday,   Dec. 30, with many traders looking for protection heading into   the new year. On the session, about 12.1 million calls and 12.9   million puts changing hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session   equity put/call volume ratio hit a one-week high of 0.76, while   the 10-day moving average rose to a one-month high of 0.67.makeArticleAd();Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call volume faltered yet again on reports the firm is cutting   iPhone production in first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) options traders are rolling out their January 2017 leaps   positions at a bargain, whileTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was names as a top pick in 2017 by Baird.Apple Inc. (AAPL)According to theNikkei Financial Daily,Apple is cutting iPhone productionby 10% in the 2017 January-March quarter. While Apple has offered   no comment on the report, theNikkeisays it has arrived at this conclusion by checking third-quarter   supplier data. That said, the cut isn't as deep as the 30% cut   for the same period in 2016.7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50%       Upside in 2017AAPL stock immediately reacted by selling off nearly 0.8% on   Friday. The shares were already feeling a bit top heavy after   hitting resistance in the $1116-$118 region - an area that had   provided support for Apple stock in October.In the options pits, AAPL options traders backed away from   call activity on Friday. Total volume rose to 906,000 contracts   for Apple, with calls only accounting for about 53% of the day's   take - well below AAPL's usual call range of 63%-64%. Overall,   put open interest has crept higher on Apple stock during the past   several weeks, with the total January put/call OI ratio rising to   its current perch at 0.79, indicating a growing concern that AAPL   stock could meet with short-term weakness.Bank of America Corp (BAC)BAC enters 2017 riding high on promises for loosening   regulations from President-elect Donald Trump and three interest   rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in 2017. While evidence of   both remain to be seen, this hasn't stopped Bank of America stock   speculators from ramping up bullish activity in the shares. In   fact, BAC stock rallied more than 32% in the final two months of   2016.With gains firmly under their belts, BACLEAPS optionstraders were on the move Friday. Total volume rose to 686,000   contracts for BAC, with calls snapping up 67% of the day's take.

The shares rallied more than 12% in   December to challenge resistance at $220 once again.TSLA's pullback to $215 at the end of the month prompted a   bullish note from analysts at Baird, which named Tesla a top pick   for 2017.According to Baird, ""TSLA's energy storage business and growth opportunity is not   currently reflected in share prices."" Baird is banking on the   coming Model 3, which will retail for $35,000, and improvements   in battery costs to help push TSLA stock higher.Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Is a Must-Watch in       2017TSLA stock options traders have been reluctant to agree.

Can Tesla Stock Drive 60 Percent Higher in 2017?;1/3/2017;"The continuous pattern of stop-and-go in shares of Tesla (TSLA) was frustrating to watch in 2016. But one prominent Wall Street analyst believe the company not only will turn things around in 2017, Tesla will deliver some 60% returns.Shares of the electric vehicle company ended last year's campaign down about 11%, trailing not only the Nasdaq 100 Index (QQQ), but also both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index. And much of Tesla's 2016 struggles was caused by the company's inability to make good on some promises, including its own vehicle production and delivery estimates. And to say nothing about the headache CEO Elon Musk caused by spending $2.6 billion to acquire SolarCity -- a deal Wall Street collectively hated.Can things change in 2017? Ben Kallo, analysts at Baird, who added Tesla as a 2017 best-pick candidate, thinks so. While citing the company's upcoming Model 3 and what he thinks is an undervalued energy storage business, Kallo last Friday slapped Tesla stock with Outperform rating and a $338 price target. Tesla shares closed Friday at $213.69, suggesting a potential premium of almost 60%.makeArticleAd();""We think the ramp of Tesla Energy and Model 3 production could exceed expectations during 2017, and believe the opportunity is not currently reflected in share price,"" Kallo wrote last Friday. ""We believe Tesla battery sales are accelerating, and we should see additional benefits from the battery production ramp coinciding with the launch of the Model 3.""Calling Kallo's price target ""overly optimistic"" would be a gross understatement. Tesla shares have a consensus target of $236, which is 30% below Kallo's estimate and suggests only a 10% increase from current levels. Tesla, nonetheless, ended 2016 on a strong note. Despite the 11% decline last year, the shares drove about 5% higher in the last three months of the year, posting 14.37% gains just in the last thirty days.Indeed, Elon Musk still has a lot to prove. He's promised that Model 3 deliveries will begin in 2017. For that to happen, Tesla needs cash to fund its aggressive production and delivery targets. Musk must also fully integrate SolarCity, which -- in its own right -- has struggled with profitability. To the extent Tesla's own cash-burn rate can fund both operations and meet its delivery forecasts remains to be seen.But as with Kallo, it's tough to bet against Musk and against Tesla stock. Assuming the company does reach its delivery target and begins Model 3 production this year, Tesla stock should regain its 2016 high of around $270, posting some 25% returns in 2017. While it's not 60%, it's not bad either.loadGallery({

Tesla Motors, Inc. Gives Potential Customers 2 Reasons to Buy Today;1/3/2017;"Image source: The Motley Fool.Going into 2017, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA)  is pulling a couple of levers to help boost   demand for its vehicles. On Jan. 1, the company said in a tweet   it is extending its deadline for buying a Tesla vehicle with free   lifetime Supercharging from Jan. 1 to Jan. 15.makeArticleAd();If you couldn't finalize your purchase by 12/31, you can still   order a Model S or X until 1/15 to receive unlimited   Supercharging.- Tesla (@TeslaMotors)January 1, 2017Tesla said in November it would end a current benefit for   Tesla buyers of getting lifetime, unlimited access to its   Supercharger network for long-distance travel. Teslas ordered   after Jan. 1, the company had said, would only include 400   kilowatt-hours of free Supercharging (roughly 1,000 miles) and   would have to pay a small fee to Supercharge beyond this   limit.The economics of charging a small fee for Supercharging beyond   approximately 1,000 miles a year would enable Tesla to ""reinvest   in the network, accelerate its growth and bring all owners,   current and future, the best Supercharging experience,"" the   company said in a blog post.But by extending the offer by two weeks, Tesla apparently   wants to give customers a bit more time to take advantage of   it.Tesla also said this weekend that it is delaying an imminent   5% price increase for U.K. customers, citing ""exceptionally high   demand,"" according to a statement Tesla provided toBloomberg.Does it matter?A two-week extension of these offers for Tesla buyers won't   likely make a meaningful difference in Tesla's first-quarter   deliveries, but the moves do suggest the two catalysts are   serving the company well in the near term.

Don’t Expect Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock to Sit Idle in 2017;1/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs 2017 the yearTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) motors higher once more … or will TSLA stock crash and burn? Let's take a look at the contentious battleground stock both off and on the price chart, and then we'll present a trading strategy based on the evidence.Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)After nearly three years of volatile but stalled price action, Tesla shares are probably due to make a meaningful move. The fact is despite a consistent barrage of negative and positive calls on TSLA stock, shares are idling near $215 - a level first hit back in February 2014.makeArticleAd();What's more, while volatile at times, TSLA has been largely stuck in a lateral price range for most of this period. The lengthy technical congestion should be nearing its conclusion, and a capitulation (for either the bulls or the bears) looks to be in the cards.For the bulls, most recently, Baird & Co. is of the mind that 2017 will pay big dividends for Tesla stock holders. Not only did the firm maintain a lofty price target of $338 (almost 60% higher!), but on Friday it named TSLA stock its best pick for the New Year.Baird anticipates Tesla will surprise naysayers and bring to market its Model 3 in 2017. It also sees the company capitalizing on a hidden gem in itsunder-the-radar energy storage business.On the other end of the spectrum, Tesla has its share of bears putting their money where their mouths are. Short interest is approaching a large 40% of TSLA stock's float, with arguments for TSLA to crash lower running the gamut.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksFor the doom-and-gloom crowd, there's concerns over the 2016 acquisition ofSolarCity Corpand how its integration and increased debt load will impact Tesla. Some bears also worry Q4 sales will invariably come in weaker-than-forecast following an aggressive Q3 campaign.Another concern? Following a $2 billion secondary offering in 2016, bears anticipate Tesla will need to tap the equity markets again in 2017 due to continued losses and cash burn.And lastly, increased EV competition from auto heavyweights likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) is another factor that could weigh on TSLA stock … and perhaps its ability to remain an ongoing business.Tesla Stock ChartClick to EnlargeTSLA has more or less been motoring around laterally for the better part of the last three years. The duration sets the stock up to break free of the technical consolidation and move into a more defined bullish uptrend or bearish downtrend in 2017.If I were to take my best guesstimate of which direction has the edge, I'd give the advantage to the bulls. That is, if TSLA stock can hold near current levels and reverse higher above $223.80.If this scenario plays out, shares should effectively hold the 200-day simple moving average and the mid-congestion support line shown in the chart. Successful testing would help confirm the bull case, while a subsequent rally through Tesla's recent high would be evidence of building price momentum and perhaps a bullish trend to emerge in 2017.How to Trade TSLA Stock HereOne catalyst that could jump-start a Tesla in 2017 is the company'sJan. 4 Gigafactory tour. That said, I like the TSLA Mar $230/$250 bull call spread as a limited-risk play right now.With Tesla shares at $213.69, the vertical is priced at $5.10 and stands to gain up to $14.90, or nearly 300%, in the event shares can trade above $250 by March expiration. Our preference is to either exit or adjust the position as Tesla stock begins to move in either price direction, rather than passively hold the position.Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Is a Must-Watch in     2017On the downside, if TSLA stock fails to hold above $210, the lower-delta vertical could be exited for an estimated loss of 75 cents to perhaps $1 rather than potentially losing the full debit.And if shares of Tesla begin to drive higher?Adjust the vertical's risk by selling some of the position or offsetting the bull call spread with a bear call spread to form a low-risk butterfly spread with a very attractive and substantial profit range.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

3 Stocks I Won't Be Selling In 2017;1/1/2017;"Oftentimes, portfolio performance can benefit fromlackof action. In other words, investors may be better off simply   leaving their stocks alone, and not worrying about timing the   market to buy and sell at the right times.""We continue to make more money when snoring than when   active,"" famed investor Warren Buffett has said. On a similar   note, he has said, ""Our favorite holding period is forever.""With this important investment principle in mind, here are   three stocks in my portfolio I almost certainly won't be selling   in 2017:Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Tesla Motors:Tesla is likely the riskiest stock of these three. But selling   before the automaker launches its lower-costModel 3, which ultimately represents the realization of the company's   ""master plan"" laid out over 10 years ago, could be a mistake.   While the stock's valuation has undoubtedly alreadypriced in expectations for extraordinary   growth, 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for the highly anticipated   vehicle preview a potential major tipping point toward electric   vehicles -- and Tesla would be at the center of this critical   shift.Facebook:Facebook stockhas run into some road bumps recently. The stock has slid about   11% since the company reported its third-quarter results on Nov.   2. The quarter's results weregreat, but investors were spooked by management's references to   expectations for big investments in 2017. Investors, however,   haveseen this before. In 2014, Facebook similarly warned investors of plans for big   investments -- and the stock has since soared 56%.Obviously, big spending doesn't automatically mean Facebook's   stock will rise again. But the world's largest social network has   earned my trust with its long-term plans as it charged forward   with big investments in mobile, predicted Instagram's huge   potential when it purchased it for $1 billion, and improved its   native Facebook platform at a blistering speed that competition   can't match.And it's not like Facebook can't afford to get more aggressive   with its spending. The company generated $2.5 billion of free   cash flow in its most recent quarter alone -- up from $1.4   billion in the year-ago quarter.Apple:Apple's revenue and EPS have faced headwinds recently, down 9%   and 15%, respectively, in the tech giant's fiscal fourth quarter   compared to the year-ago period. So why would I hold onto a   business with financial results so dismal? Two reasons:The stock is cheap. With its price-to-earnings ratio of     just 14,Apple stockalready prices in expectations for sustained challenges.The scale and reach of Apple's robust ecosystem of     user-friendly products has proved to be a sustainable     foundation for customer loyalty, pricing power, and repeat     purchases.Sometimes, it's best just to sit back and give your stocks   time to perform. Image source: Getty Images.But beyond these reasons for holding these three stocks   throughout 2017, my main motive for holding them is simply to   avoid the pitfalls of market timing and to maximize my time   invested in stocks. The best way I know to invest is to simply   buy solid companies with long-term prospects and hold them for   the long haul.Sure, if Tesla, Facebook, or Apple begin to consistently make   poor decisions, I may consider selling. But barring any major   unexpected issues, I plan to give them the chance to meet -- or   possibly even exceed -- my expectations in 2017 and beyond.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

1 Big Solar Trend to Watch in 2017;1/1/2017;"Efficiency is now the name of the game in the solar industry   and leading manufacturers will spend the next few years moving   beyond commodity silicon solar panels to higher-efficiency   technology.SunPower Corporation(NASDAQ: SPWR) has long led the industry in efficiency and with   its X-Series product exceeding 23% efficiency that leadership   position won't end soon. But others are starting to catch up.Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) recently announced a new record of 22.61% for its   mono-PERC cell technology, something others will follow.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) is another major manufacturer moving forward with   mono-PERC technology, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is launching high-efficiency panels this year with   Panasonic's HIT technology. The world of solar energy is about to   get a lot more efficient.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Chinese solar manufacturers put an emphasis on     efficiencySolar panel manufacturers, particularly in China, have been   plagued by little differentiation in their products. They use   similar equipment and processes to make solar panels, which leads   to very similar panel efficiencies and fairly similar cost   structures. But in the last decade there has been little   incentive to focus on efficiency because costs were coming down   quickly and often offset the advantage higher efficiency   brought.But the cost/efficiency dynamic is changing. Solar panel and   overall system costs have come down so far that even a   100-basis-point improvement in panel efficiency can lower a   system's cost per watt by 5% or more. And if that efficiency is   combined with lower long-term degradation, as it is with   SunPower's panels, the impact on cost per kWh can be even higher.   So, manufacturers finally have an incentive to increase   efficiency and lower costs.Trina Solar and Canadian Solar are investing in PERC   technology to move up the value curve. Higher-efficiency panels   will sell for a higher price per watt, particularly to customers   installing small residential or commercial projects where   efficiency is more valuable, and both companies want to capture   the financial benefit of the market. For example, a 300-watt   solar panel that sells for $0.40 per watt will generate $120 in   revenue. A 360-watt panel that sells for $0.55 per watt is worth   $198.Now that higher-efficiency panels are in demand, look for the   15% to 17% efficient panels that have dominated production to   begin to be replaced by panels that are 18% to 20% efficient.Tesla's efficiency playThe efficiency dynamic isn't lost on Tesla's SolarCity, which   is building a plant in Buffalo, New York, to make high-efficiency   solar panels. Management has said they expect efficiency to be   over 20% when the product launches with 22% panel efficiency on   the horizon.Since Tesla is installing mostly small rooftop systems, the   investment in efficiency makes sense. It leverages the company's   sales and installation costs and puts more watts of solar   production on each roof.SunPower's two-pronged efficiency planComing from a leadership position is SunPower, which has long   been an efficiency leader. The company's E-Series product, which   was 19% to 21% efficient, is now facing competition from PERC   manufacturers that have a lower cost structure. That's why the   investment in X-Series, which is over 23% efficient, has been   important to the last year's financial results in the residential   market. If X-Series can continue to improve efficiency and keep   down cost, the company could maintain a lead over mono-PERC   competitors.In the utility maker, SunPower is taking a different approach.   P-Series is its low-cost solar panel that's only slightly more   efficient than conventional solar panels. Right now, it's a   multicrystalline product but management has told me it will   eventually be a mono-crystalline product, likely leading to   efficiencies approaching 20%. And since there are fewer   processing steps, it should be lower cost than mono-PERC on a   per-watt basis.Jockeying for position in solar efficiencyEvery major manufacturer is trying to improve its efficiency   to differentiate itself and 2017 will likely be a transitional   year.

10 Tech Investing Quotes From the World's Best Venture Capitalists;12/31/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.When you make a living by finding and investing in the world's   most promising start-ups, you probably know a thing or two about   business. Leading venture capital firms have minted fortunes for   themselves and their limited partners by investing in current   tech titans likeApple,Alphabet,Oracle,Facebook, and many more when they were just nascent start-ups.makeArticleAd();However, after considering the business wisdom ofvisionary business leaders, it recently occurred to me that examining some quotes from   leading VCs could also prove tremendously useful for tech   investors. So, banking off of this same logic, let's examine a   series of quotes from some of the world's leading venture   capitalists on subjects including the business of venture   capital, business in general, and technology.About the business of venture capitalMany readers may not be particularly familiar with the venture   capital world: how it works, how it's financed, and how VC firms   make money. As such, this quote from Union Squares Ventures   partner Fred Wilson serves as a nice way to frame what   exactly venture capitalists do.Venture capital is about capturing the value between the     start-up phase and the public company phase. -- Fred WilsonIn general, venture capital firms can invest in private   companies at any stage in their development. Though not always as   strictly codified, these stages range from the initial seed round   of financing used to get a nascent company off the ground to the   later stages, series C or later, that often take place in theyears preceding an IPO. What's more, the results can be astounding. According to the   National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the average annual   return of VC investments is an astounding 57%.Especially in moments when tech investing is particularly en   vogue, the number of VC firms and the amount of money chasing   start-ups can create some unintended consequences, as a number of   established venture capitalists have also noted.There are lots of ways to make money in venture capital, and     there are even more ways to be mediocre. The industry has too     much money and too many smart people chasing too few great     entrepreneurs. -- Dan LevitanAll markets have boom and bust cycles, and I think venture     capital market has even more exaggerated boom and bust cycles.     -- Fred WilsonBoth issues might sound eerily similar to the issues many   investors encounter when investing in the stock market. However,   much like our ethos here at The Motley Fool, investors can   overcome, or even benefit from the cyclical nature of the market   by maintaining a focus on the long term.The big advantage that we have as a venture capital firm     over a hedge fund or a mutual fund is we have a 13-year lockup     on our money. And so enterprise can go in and out of fashion     four different times, and we can go and invest in one of these     companies, and it's OK, because we can stay the course. -- Marc     AndreessenBusiness in generalInvesting in high-growth private companies involves many of   the same skill sets public market investors need to cultivate in   order to succeed. The best venture capitalists think about   business models, market economics, and competitive dynamics at a   high level. Especially in the tech sector, where newly minted   public companies often remain unprofitable, it's important for   investors to remember that a path toward eventual profitability   is an essential piece of any investing thesis, as Bill   Gurley succinctly states in the two following quote:If one asserts that buying customers below what they charge     them is a corporate strategy, this is in essence an arbitrage     game, and arbitrage games rarely last. -- Bill GurleyYou can create infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85     cents. And if you give consumers more value than you charge     them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneurs all     the time that Webvan had the highest NPS scores of any company     I've ever known. It wasn't that the consumer proposition didn't     work, it was that the economics didn't work. They weren't     charging enough for the service level. -- Bill GurleyA litany of examples come to mind, here. Companies likeZynga,Gluu Mobile,Skull Candy, and evenTwitterhave generated tremendous losses for their investors as the   overly optimistic stories around which they came public   predictably failed to materialize. If the company's economics   don't make sense or don't seem achievable, that should be a major   red flag, but it's one investors have consistently overlooked --   to their detriment.Also similar to investing in public companies, the leaders of   the best start-ups resemble the entrepreneurs running the world's   most successful public companies. Individuals likeTesla's Elon Musk orFacebook's Mark Zuckerberg have taken huge personal risks to bring their   visions into the world. Further affirming this idea, leading   venture capitalists also seek this visionary quality in the   companies in which they invest.The very best entrepreneurs are relatively advantaged in     times of scarce capital. They can raise money in any     environment. Loose capital allows the less qualified to     participate in each market. -- Bill GurleyInnovation and technologyRounding out these quotes, venture capitalists live and die by   identifying the companies that will define coming waves of   disruption. As such, they spend a disproportionate amount of time   thinking about the current and future state of technology. One of   the key themes is that software will continue to automate and   upend sections of the economy as Marc Andreessen candidly   observes:Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be     disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley     companies doing the disruption in more cases than not. -- Marc     AndreessenHowever, software isn't necessarily the only way we should   understand technology either, as early Facebook investor Peter   Thiel notes:The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology.     The rapid progress of information technology in recent decades     has made Silicon Valley the capital of ""technology"" in general.     But there is no reason why technology should be limited to     computers. Properly understood, any new and better way of doing     things is technology. -- Peter Thiel fromZero to OneFurthering this idea, famed VC John Doerr sees a truly   game-changing investing opportunity in one largely undisrupted   area of the economy:Green-tech could be the largest economic opportunity of the     21st Century. -- John DoerrSpotting the next big thing is indeed hard work. However, as   the world's most successful venture capitalists have demonstrated   time and again, doing so is indeed possible. Similarly, investors   in public market companies that follow this same line of   reasoning can also do extremely well over the long term.   Integrating these above ideas to your research process should   certainly help increase your odds of successful investing.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

The Big Strategic Shift Coming to the Solar Industry in 2017;12/31/2016;"The solar industry has been through a lot of strategic changes   over the past decade as cell manufacturers moved to making   panels, panel manufacturers started building power plants, and   power plant companies began moving into financing. In many ways,   vertical integration was the name of the game.But the past year of turmoil has shown that vertically   integrating into every part of the solar business might not make   sense. There's no fundamental advantage an installer likeTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has in financing solar versus a bank, and in many   ways it may have a disadvantage. And solar manufacturers may not   be the best at building massive power plants, something utilities   and independent power producers have decades of experience doing.   So, what's the trend to watch in 2017? Solar companies are   offering an integrated product design that customers can install   more efficiently than the piecemeal designs of the past.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Backing away from the finance gameOne of the broad trends over the past five years in the solar   industry is that solar companies began to finance more of their   own projects. Small-system installers like Tesla's Solar,Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) , andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) could offer simple lease or power purchase agreement   (PPA) financing with $0 for customers and then aggregate the tax   benefits and payments in large financing projects. For bigger   projects like whatFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) were building, self-financing eliminated a   discount buyers demanded for taking on project risk and allowed   them to take advantage of falling financing costs.If there was one broad finance trend in 2016, it was that   solar companies financing their own projects began to backfire.   Small projects began to be financed through loans as more banks   and small lenders emerged, lowering the cost of capital for   customers. And rising yields on yieldcos like8point3 EnergyPartners(NASDAQ: CAFD) made self-financing less attractive because the   price a yieldco would pay for a project began to decline. For   large developers, holding projects on the balance sheet suddenly   became a bad thing and now they're looking to sell projects   before construction even begins, leaving financing risk to a   company better suited to accept that risk.Designing entire systems will be the name of the gameIn response to these financing trends, major solar companies   are beginning to design off-the-shelf solutions for solar   developers and utilities. The developer will then take care of   things like financing and securing power purchase agreements,   while the solar company concentrates on designing solar systems   to maximize energy production and lower cost. In some cases,   they're even adding services beyond solar, like energy   storage.Image source: SunPower.This shift can be seen in First Solar and SunPower's product   line changes. First Solar is upgrading from Series 4 solar panels   to Series 6, which is a full panel and racking system with the   option of adding energy storage and functions all the way to   transmission. SunPower's Oasis system is a complete solution from   site selection to building a power plant with trackers and the   P-Series solar panels. Both solutions are essentially   off-the-shelf offerings the companies will provide to a variety   of customers around the world. And it means in many places   they'll be backing away from bidding on projects themselves in   many locations.SunPower's residential and commercial solar solutions follow   along the same lines. Known as Equinox and Helix, respectively,   they are a solution installers can buy pre-designed and just   install on a rooftop.Tesla has been moving to this model for years. It bought Zep   Solar to bring a racking product in-house, bought Silevo to begin   manufacturing solar panels, and now Tesla's acquisition of   SolarCity brings both products together with energy storage. Now,   Tesla will be making most of the valuable components of the solar   system. And it's moving toward more sales through loans, backing   away from leases and PPAs.Solar solutions are the next big thingMoving toward more complete solutions makes sense for the   solar industry because it helps move more cost from the field to   the factory, where components can be built efficiently and   designed to work seamlessly together. The days of piecemeal   design of solar systems are coming to an end.The companies that can combine solar solution design with   differentiated products like high-efficiency solar panels will be   well positioned for the future. Bottom line: SunPower, First   Solar, and Tesla have a leg up on the competition in building out   the solar product solutions of the future.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

"Tesla's New Autopilot Is ""Days"" From Release";12/30/2016;"When electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) announced its Autopilot 2.0 sensors in October,   Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he hoped to begin rolling out major   software updates for the new technology before the year ended.   But with only one more day left in the year, it's not looking   like Tesla will meet its target. However, the software is ""almost   there,"" Musk said in a tweet on Thursday.""Under going final validation. Might go out in the next few   days,"" Musk tweeted back to someone asking about whether 8.1   would be released this weekend.makeArticleAd();Tesla demonstrates the capabilities of its new Autopilot   sensors. Image source: Tesla Motors.Catching upThe update, which would be a part of the expected Tesla 8.1   software, is particularly important because it is set to help   catch up the capabilities of Autopilot 2.0 vehicles to those of   Autopilot 1.0. Until Tesla updates the software for vehicles with   its second-generation sensor suite, Tesla vehicles are lacking   key safety assist features, such as automatic emergency braking,   collision warning, blind-spot detection, and side-collision   warning. In addition, the Autopilot 2.0 vehicles are still   missing convenience features like auto-steer, auto-park, and   summoning.Earlier this month, Musk said on Twitter that the next update   may include most of the functionality from Autopilot 1.0.   Eventually, of course, Tesla plans for Autopilot 2.0 to exceed   Autopilot 1.0's capabilities, hence its new name: enhanced   autopilot.Why it mattersSince Autopilot 2.0 sensors are included standard in   every vehicle Tesla delivers, the stakes are high for Tesla to   get the software right.Just how useful Tesla's autopilot sensors are was recently   brought to light when a dash cam captured a Tesla vehicle   alerting an owner and begin applying brakes to avoid an accident   after the sensors observed a car hitting its brakes two vehicles   ahead.Original video, authorisation from the owner. Essential, no   one could predict the accident but the radar did and acted by   emergency braking.pic.twitter.com/70MySRiHGR- Hans Noordsij (@HansNoordsij)December 27, 2016This capability for Tesla vehicles to see ""through"" the car in   front of it was added in an important update in September. As   part of the update, Tesla upgraded radar from simply serving as a   supplementary sensor to become a primary control sensor alongside   the camera's image recognition system. Tesla asserted in a blog   post about the update that this would help vehicles ""almost   always hit the brakes correctly.""Going further, Tesla explained how the vehicle can   surprisingly see ""through"" vehicles:[A] Tesla will also be able to bounce the radar signal     under a vehicle in front -- using the radar pulse signature and     photon time of flight to distinguish the signal -- and still     brake even when trailing a car that is opaque to both vision     and radar. The car in front might hit the UFO in dense fog, but     the Tesla will not.Without Tesla's 8.1 software update, Tesla owners won't   benefit from safety features like this.Tesla's upcoming Autopilot update will be just the beginning   of many for Tesla vehicles with second-generation sensors. Longer   term, Tesla says Autopilot 2.0 will even enable fully autonomous   driving. But there are a few caveats: Tesla still needs to   validate the self-driving software, regulators will need to   approve the features' use, and owners will have to pay up $8,000   to $10,000, depending on whether they purchase the feature before   or after delivery (safety aspects of Autopilot, like emergency   braking, come standard on every Tesla).10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;12/30/2016;"As the year comes to a close, it's fitting that the week in   solar was dominated by the kind of large, macro trends that seem   to move and shake the solar industry every few months. But unlike   2015, when we had Nevada upend net metering in the final hours of   the year, most of the news from the solar industry is positive at   the end of 2016. There are still some challenges looking forward,   but policy seems to be favoring solar energy in the long   term.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();China resets renewable energy pricesOne of the biggest drivers of solar growth in 2016 was China's   feed-in tariff rates. A feed-in tariff drove an estimated 13 GW   of solar installations in the first half of the year before being   reset in the second half. Now feed-in tariff rates will fall   another 19% for 2017, and China has lowered its 2020 installation   target from 150 GW to a minimum of 105 GW.Chinese leadership has also suggested that local governments   use auctions for renewable energy, which has been a successful   arrangement in Latin America and Europe. At the very least, this   gives some stability to the solar market in 2017, and may help   increase demand for solar panels overall next year.Another state solar winOhio has had a freeze on its renewable energy mandates for the   last two years, and lawmakers wanted to extend that hold -- but   Governor John Kasich vetoed a bill that would have made energy   mandates voluntary for another two years. Kasich was praised by   seven major employers in Ohio for keeping renewable energy   mandates. And it shouldn't go unnoticed thatFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) has a major manufacturing plant there and is   upgrading the facility over the next couple of years.In state after state, solar energy has fought off regulatory   and legislative battles to grow its presence in the energy   industry. Ohio is another example of a big solar win, and as a   leading Midwestern state it may become a solar leader, showing   where the future of energy jobs is headed.Panasonic helping Tesla with solarPanasonic is coming to the rescue of SolarCity's Silevo solar   manufacturing plant, agreeing to invest $256 million in the   facility.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) made the investment contingent on its SolarCity   acquisition going through; now that the companies are combined,   Panasonic is being brought in to help with solar.Panasonic says production will begin in the summer of 2017   with 1 GW of production expected in 2019, but it's worth pointing   out that Panasonic has had trouble making competitive solar   panels itself, and Silevo's technology has proven disappointing,   especially given the fact that it had to bring in a partner to   bring production to fruition.It's also worth noting that this Panasonic partnership will   help make the cells for the solar roof. Not only is the Buffalo   facility key to keeping Tesla ahead of competitors in rooftop   solar, it will be key to making the solar roof a reality. There's   a lot riding on this partnership today.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Shines in Consumer Reports Survey;12/30/2016;"Earlier this month,Consumer Reportsonce again named electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) the most-loved car brand, with the brand's 91%   overall owner-satisfaction rating trouncing every other car maker   on the planet. Indeed, second-place Porsche was a wide seven   percentage points behind. And third-place Audi trailed Tesla by a   whopping 14 percentage points. Topping off Tesla's high brand   score,CRalso said both of Tesla's vehicle models -- S and X -- had   exceptionally high customer satisfaction scores on their own.Here's a closer look.makeArticleAd();Tesla's Model S (left) and Model X (right). Image source: The   Motley Fool.Tesla's customer satisfactionSo, how exactly areCR's ratings derived?CRexplains:Our brand rankings represent owner sentiment across each     brand's product line. (Model satisfaction is determined by the     percentage of owners who responded ""definitely yes"" to the     question of whether they would buy the same vehicle if they had     it to do all over again.) To determine brand love -- or disdain     -- we took a straight average of the satisfaction score for     each brand's models.In order to qualify, the brand had to have at least two     models with data. For this analysis, we focused on cars from     model years 2014-2017 to represent the current state of the     brands, which included over 300,000 vehicles from the     survey.Of course, investors should note that whileCR's 91% customer satisfaction rating for Tesla was higher than any   other automaker's rating, the rating was down considerably from   its 98% and 99% ratings in recent years. This is likely   attributable to the Model S's wider adoption outside of the   hardcore early adopters who likely represented a large portion of   Tesla customers in the sedan's earlier years. Tesla's sales have   doubled over the last two years, opening up its vehicles to a   wider, more diverse customer base.Customers love the Model X, tooConsidering that Tesla's new Model X -- whichCRrecently criticized for having ""compromised functionality"" and   ""dismal first-year reliability"" -- was included in the survey   this year for the first time during 2016, it's arguably good news   to see Tesla still ranked so high on the list.The Model X. Image source: Tesla Motors.Tesla's Model X surprisingly performed quite well when it   comes to owner satisfaction. InCR's car-by-car owner satisfaction ratings, the Model X came in   eighth place, with a score of 88% -- not far behind the Model S's   94% rating. So, while the Model X was holding back Tesla's   overall brand ranking, the new SUV's score was still notably high   considering the reliability issues the complex vehicle has   experienced during its first year.Tesla said in its third-quarter shareholder letter, released   in October, that the Model X's reliability improved dramatically   as the year went on.""The amount of [reliability] issues that we have addressed   with Model X have fallen by 92% in the last 12 months,"" Tesla   said, ""a reflection of the improvements we have made in Model X   due to our ability and commitment to react quickly to   issues.""Image source: The Motley Fool.Improvements in reliability are not only important for   customers, but also for Tesla's business. By improving the   reliability of both the Model S and Model X, Tesla's warranty   accrual rates (the percentage of warranty reserves used for   warranty claims, on both new and used vehicles) declined between   Q2 and Q3.Tesla's ability to satisfy customers is a key metric for   investors. It's crucial for a young automaker to stand out with   satisfying products. If Tesla's ability to delight customers   fades, its well-capitalized competition could establish a   foothold with would-be Tesla customers and mitigate Tesla's   growth potential -- a threat that will only become more prominent   as automakers follow through with their plans to release more   long-range, fully electric vehicles in the coming years. Further,   Tesla's vehicles will likely be scrutinized closely in 2017, as   the company prepares to launch its lower-priced, higher-volume   Model 3 in the second half of the year.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

General Motors' main joint venture in China, Shanghai GM, is being charged with a fine of 201 million yuan or $29 million for monopolistic pricing behavior. Shanghai GM - a 50-50 joint venture between General Motors and state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp. - enforced minimum dealer sales price for Cadillac SRX, Chevrolet Trax and Buick Excelle models in order to counter competition. However, Chinese regulators are particular about the pricing of products and services in the economy and believe that this monopolistic behavior suppresses healthy market competition.

GM Takes a Step Forward Toward Autonomous Vehicles;12/29/2016;"General Motors' (GM) CEO Mary Barra said that the company would start testing autonomous cars on the roads of Michigan very soon to evaluate how the driverless technology would perform against the greater Detroit area's harsh winters.This comes after Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed the bill permitting the testing of autonomous vehicles on Michigan roads.General Motors plans to test the self-driving Chevy Bolt electric vehicles on the public roadways of Michigan after Snyder agreed to allow the testing of certain parameters for testing and deploying driverless cars in the state. Michigan aims to move ahead of California and other states in a drive to become home to the autonomous car movement. Silicon Valley players includingTesla(TSLA),Alphabet(GOOG)(GOOGL) and Uber are at the forefront of implementing self-driving technology. The laws provide ride-sharing services to use autonomous cars without human intervention.makeArticleAd();Barra made another major announcement that the next generation self-driving cars would be produced in the Orion Township assembly plant, where the company manufactures the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. The testing vehicles will be equipped with LIDAR, sensors, cameras and other devices for safety. Barra said in a press conference, ""We expect GM will become the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass production assembly plant.""The Detroit automaker has already been testing its driverless vehicle in its Technical Center campus in Warren, Michigan. In total, General Motors has around 40 testing vehicles in the two cities. The automaker now plans to extend its testing to the public roads in the metro area of Detroit. General Motors proposes to make the area its key location for advancing its autonomous technology for winters.The bill signed by Snyder lays out parameters for testing the technology by establishing regulations on how driverless vehicles could legally run on public roads. The enacted law permits testing of vehicles without human intervention and without steering wheels or pedals.However, there are certain challenges that driverless cars would have to face. During winters, snowfall can cause the roads to be unclear and such tough road conditions would make the movement of cars not driven by humans unpredictable.Push toward going autonomousGeneral Motors' moves in the last 18 months have clearly displayed its aggression in developing the autonomous technology. The carmaker's announcement regarding its partnership with startup firm Lyft and acquisition of Cruise Automation are among its latest initiatives in advancing its autonomous technology.The automaker has been fueling its effort to develop a strong robust autonomous technology. This can be validated through the company's latest partnership and acquisition moves. In addition, General Motors has also been testing prototypes in Arizona and California. At the press conference, Barra displayed the electric Chevrolet Bolt with rooftop sensors, which is designed to assist autonomous driving.General Motors has been working hard to build a foolproof driverless technology. The company's management hasn't disclosed when General Motors will begin testing without a human driver but expects it to happen over the next two years. General Motors also plans to begin operating a fleet of self-driving taxis, which would be allowed under the Michigan law.Disclosure:I do not hold any position in the stock mentioned in this article.Start afree seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Warren Buffett Recent BuysFree seven-day trialWhat Should Be Your First Stock?Toshiba Announces Possible Write-Down of Several Billion DollarsPremium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA), Visa Inc (V) and Walt Disney Co (DIS);12/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsThe year-end trading volume continues to dry up and allow   stocks to get pushed around, but there are a few technically   driven names that are seeing an opportunity to move higher based   on their evolving technical pictures. Today's three big stock   charts look atTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Visa Inc(NYSE:V) andWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), as all three stocks are getting ready to make technically   driven moves when the New Year opens for trading.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)makeArticleAd();Shares of Tesla are seeing selling today, despite some   positive news in the media over the last few days. The TSLA   selloff is more attached to the technically oversold signal   generated by the recent rally than anything else. That said, the   response to this signal is paramount in setting the tone for   Tesla's first-quarter trading direction.While the recent rally has taken out a few technical   trendlines, it has left TSLA open to a reversal as the 200-day   moving average is acting out as resistance. This trendline acted   as resistance for the shares in November, ultimately sending them   tumbling back to the $180-support-level.The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for       2017In addition, the chart resistance of $220 has continued to   build. Tesla traders are familiar with this price point providing   reversals as the stock spent an extended period consolidating   above $220 in the summer months. A break back below $220 and the   200-day will likely trigger technical selling that moves TSLA   shares 10% lower in the first month of the New Year. Upside   potential remains if Tesla gets enough buying here to   maintain levels above this critical trading zone.Visa Inc (V)Visa shares have been worked into a technical corner as they   continue to try to muster the strength to move back above the   $80-level. The growing problem is that this mark is becoming   congested with technical trendlines that are declining to provide   resistance for V. The pending Death Cross that will be formed in   the next two weeks based on current trends is also concerning for   Visa stock.Since rolling over in October, V stock has been   underperforming the market by a wide margin. The bump in consumer   optimism seen after the elections didn't even help the credit   card processor to gain traction. Now, Visa stock is facing   growing pressure and a likely dip into the lower $70s during the   first quarter of 2017.Staunch pressure from the $80-level on the chart is now even   stronger from the 50-day moving average, which has descended to   this same price region. The declining 50-day on its own puts V   stock in an intermediate-term bearish category.By our model's estimates, we will see a Death Cross on Visa   stock in the next two weeks when the 50-day moving average   crosses below the 200-day. This is more of a headline-grabber   than a reliable signal, but it will drive home short-term   selling.For now, traders are better off watching for the next   meaningful dip to buy shares of V, or moving on to another   processor in the same sector.Walt Disney Co (DIS)Disney shares have been one of the better performers in the   Consumer Discretionary sector as they have shot 15% higher since   November. Now, DIS stock is pulling back from overbought signals,   but the move appears to be nothing more than a rest ahead of the   next rally.Looking at the trendline analysis, Disney has successfully   transitioned into intermediate-term bullish conditions as of Dec.   7, and has improved the breadth of the move.Should You Buy Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)       Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsThe current pullback is a ""healthy"" correction as DIS shares   moved too far, too fast. This means that the profit-takers are   sending shares lower right now, and it's not a change in the   money flow into the Disney stock. Given that DIS shares boast a   1.5% dividend, they aren't going to get tangled-up in the   interest rate risk trade as the Ten Year Treasury Yield continues   to push higher. Instead, Disney provides average dividend yield   potential along with growth - a good combination for the current   market.Watch for DIS shares to test the $100 to $102-range on prices   if the selling pressure picks up, but this is where we're more   likely to see technical traders start to pick up on the   opportunity for the shares to set forth on their next rally.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for       2017The 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to OwnThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Tesla Motors Inc   (TSLA), Visa Inc (V) and Walt Disney Co (DIS)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

But for decades, the bears have been wrong about AMZN stock.Source:Atomic Taco Via FlickrMy last write-up on Amazon was a complete an easy win that delivered a 22% yield in about a month. Today, I'd like to set up another trade on AMZN.makeArticleAd();Buying equities at all-time highs carries undue risk. This is especially true for a momentum play like AMZN stock. Should the markets correct, Amazon and other momentum stocks will lead lower faster than most other stocks. Therein lies the dilemma. How can I go long Amazon without taking undue risk?Luckily, the options markets allow me to structure trades with limited and calculated risk. In this case, I will buy a bullish play since I have house money from previous AMZN trades. I also will sell bullish risk at levels that I deem unlikely to be reached.Fundamentally, Amazon is great. It's eating the lunch of all its competitors. The e-commerce giant has crippled brick-and-mortar retail. And it's also beating a lot of other tech companies in the cloud with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division.7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50%     Upside in 2017Also, theAmazon Echo and Tapsold out during the holidays. The ubiquity of these two could infuse an influx of new Prime members. This membership money flows to the bottom line, so there could be an upside surprise.Click to EnlargeTechnically, I see AMZN's stock price tightening. This usually resolves itself with a breakout from these levels. The direction of the breakout though unclear, I am willing to bet it will be to the upside. So I will buy that upside potential and finance it by selling risk below current levels.I see similar bullish setups in other mega-caps likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). I could diffuse the risk and buy calls in thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ). But instead I will continue betting on a clear winner in AMZN - as long as markets in general don't correct early in 2017.Let's take a look at the trade.How to Trade Amazon Stock HereThe bet:Buy the AMZN Mar $785/$790 debit call spread for $2.10 per contract. That would be my maximum risk. If Amazon rises above $790, I stand to double my money.If you want to make this a true lotto ticket, buy the call spread much higher than current levels. The Feb AMZN $820/$825 debit call spread only costs $1.30 per contract. It's higher, so it's less likely to win … but the reward would be much greater.Red-Hot Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending 2016     on a CliffhangerI always like to limit my risk. In this case, I want to sell bullish risk to finance the purchase of the call spread.The Bank:Sell AMZN Feb $675/$670 credit put spreads for 65 cents per contract.

Weekly jobless claims and November trade-balance   data are on tap, and could provide additional pressure to stocks   after yesterday's 100-point loss on the Dow, pushing the 20,000   dream back into 2017.Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere last seen up 0.02%, withS&P 500futures up 0.09% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.04%.makeArticleAd();On the options front, volume recovered a bit on Wednesday, as   those traders remaining on Wall Street looked to hedge their   positions ahead of the New Year's break. That said, activity was   still anemic, with only about 10.3 million calls and 9.2 million   puts changing hands. Running against the grain, however, the   CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped to   another two-week low of 0.61.

What's more, one   trader in particular took out a rather large synthetic short   position on AAPL stock.Specifically, a block of 9,500 Jan 2017 series $110 puts were   bought late yesterday at the ask price of 32 cents, according toTrade-Alert.com. At the same time, a block of 9,500 Jan 2017 series $110 calls   were sold at the bid of $7.15. The trader netted a credit of   $6.83, or $683 per pair of contracts, for the trade, and can   realize a profit as implieds decline and AAPL stock   stagnates.Additionally, the trade has near unlimited downside potential,   with the put gaining significantly in value if AAPL stock trades   below $110 ahead of expiration, and unlimited upside risk due to   the sold $110 call.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)After surging more than 9% on Tuesday following abullish research note from Pacific Crest, NVDA stock gave back most of those gains following anexceedingly bearish note from Citron Research. According to Citron, Wall Street is ignoring market headwinds   that will push NVDA stock back to $90, including increased market   competition and lower licensing revenue.Options activity on NVDA was little changed compared to   Tuesday's action, with calls accounting for 54% of the 662,000   contracts traded in the Wednesday session. Furthermore, the total   January 2017 put/call open interest ratio (which includes all   January weekly series) ticked higher to 1.63, suggesting profit   taking from call traders, and/or increased put activity.For Jan 2017 series, peak call OI totals 6,900 contracts at   the $100 strike, while peak put OI numbers 5,000 contracts at the   $90 strike, as neither call nor put traders expect NVDA to move   much higher.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX)VRX stock has had a rough 2016, with the shares plunging more   than 86% on the year. What's more, Valeant shares are a far cry   from their 2015 peak near $263, closing yesterday at a lowly   $14.23 by comparison. The plummeting share price hasn't deterred   many VRX options traders, however, with the stock seeing volume   of more than 241,000 contracts on Wednesday, where calls   accounted for a whopping 89% of the day's take.But there was some exceedingly odd block activity on VRX   yesterday.Trade-Alert.comdata indicates that a large block of 45,000 VRX Jan 2017 series   $27.50 calls were sold for a bid price of 2 cents, or $2 per   contract. At the same time, a block of nearly 30,000 January   $42.50 calls were sold for a bid of a penny, or $1 per   contract.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock: THIS Is the       Number to WatchThis deep-out-of-the-money call selling on VRX could be the   closure of a long-held bullish position, especially considering   January LEAPS have been available for quite some time.But the oddest element to this trade is that implied   volatility for these options is through the roof at 115% and   162%, respectively. In other words, options traders are pricing   in one heck of a move for VRX through January 2017 expiration.   This is fortunate for the aforementioned trader, as it provides   some return on exiting that long call play on VRX when these   contracts would normally be worthless at this point.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Sell in January 20177 Stocks That Won't Be Around a Year From       NowThe postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock: THIS Is the Number to Watch;12/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsEver since hitting lows around $180 in early December,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has rebounded 22% - far outpacing theS&P 500andNasdaq-100. However, just as the previous selloff in Tesla stock was   overdone - as I have mentioned before - so too is this rally.Now, I'm looking for TSLA shares to consolidate around the key   $220 level over the coming weeks.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');From a technical perspective, Tesla stock is showing   some extremely overbought readings, with the 9-day RSI at   nearly 85. Previous instances when Tesla stock reached such   levels proved to be very opportune times to take a short position   in TSLA stock.Click to EnlargeOne of the biggest drivers of Tesla's recent monster rally may   have been short covering. TSLA stock was thesecond-most shorted Nasdaq stockas of Dec. 15, with days to cover at 8.72. The average Nasdaq-100   stock had a days-to-cover measure of just 3.51. So it's likely   that much of the rally since Dec. 15 can be attributed to shorts   covering before year's end.But with the shorts obliterated, Tesla shares may no   longer enjoy this benefit.5 Stocks to Sell in January 2017In aprevious post on TSLA, I highlighted how $220 was the number to watch in Tesla.   Certainly that still applies. Tesla stock has once again returned   to that critical level. Given the magnitude of the recent move, I   think TSLA will encounter difficulties moving past this key area   - at least in the short-term.Click to EnlargeYesterday's price action was telling, with TSLA stock opening   past the $220 level and trading higher, only to succumb to   selling pressure and closing back below $220. This type of   reversal day - especially at a key inflection point and following   10 days of gains in the past 12 - often signals that the buyers   have become exhausted.Click to EnlargeTo position for a stall in Tesla's recent rally, I prefer a   short call spread.How to Trade Tesla Stock HereBuy the TSLA Jan $237.50 calls and sell the TSLA Jan     $235 calls for a 50-cent net credit.These are the traditional monthly options that expire Jan. 20,   2017, well before Tesla's earnings report, expected to come   Feb. 8.Maximum gain on the trade is $50 per spread. Maximum risk is   $200 per spread. Return on risk is 25%.Red-Hot Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending 2016       on a CliffhangerThe short $235 strike is positioned 6.9% higher than the   $219.74 closing price of TSLA stock, providing a nice upside   cushion. This also aligns with Tesla's late July highs.I would close out the trade on a meaningful move past $235   while looking to have the spread expire worthless and keep the   initial $50 credit if TSLA stock remains well-behaved.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in     any of the aforementioned securities.

Tesla Motors, Inc. to Announce Vehicle Deliveries Next Week;12/28/2016;"GivenTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) practice of announcing quarterly vehicle   deliveries within three days of the end of the quarter, the   electric-car maker is due to update investors on the important   metric sometime between Sunday morning and Tuesday night. Ahead   of its important Model 3 launch next year, will the automaker   meet expectations and potentially strengthen investor confidence   in the company's ability to keep growing?Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Here's a look back at Tesla's recent vehicle deliveries, and a   look ahead at what to expect from deliveries during the important   holiday quarter.Rapid growthThe company's recent growth sets the stage for high   expectations in Tesla's fourth quarter.In its third quarter, Tesla reported surprising growth in   vehicle deliveries. Vehicles deliveries soared 114% year over   year and 72% sequentially thanks to a sequential rebound in Model   S deliveries and a continued production ramp-up of the company's   late-2015 launched Model X SUV.Data retrieved from quarterly SEC filings for quarters shown.   Chart source: author.Notably, Tesla's third-quarter deliveries helped drive the   company's highest year-over-year growth in the key metric in any   12-month period since the second half of 2014. In the   trailing-12-month period ending Sept. 30, Tesla's vehicle   deliveries were up 66% year over year.What to expect in Q4Going into its fourth quarter, management said it expects to   deliver ""just over 25,000"" vehicles. This would represent only   about a 1% sequential increase in deliveries, but it would make   for a 44% year-over-year jump.Tesla didn't make guessing its vehicle deliveries very easy in   2016. The company missed its quarterly guidance for deliveries   during the first two quarters of the year, and it subsequently   reduced its full-year guidance from expectations for 80,000 to   90,000 vehicles to a forecast for about 79,000 units.And another factor making forecasting difficult is the way the   company's quarterly Model S deliveries have bounced around   recently, hitting an all-time high above 17,000 in the fourth   quarter of 2015 and falling below 10,000 in the second quarter of   2016. While Model S deliveries rebounded significantly in Q3 to   16,000 units, it's not clear whether there is more growth ahead   for the luxury sedan.But despite recent volatility in Model S deliveries, and   despite the company's missed targets in the first half of the   year, there's still good reason to believe Tesla could meet or   even exceed its fourth-quarter guidance. Namely, demand could   benefit fromTesla's introduction of self-driving hardware,   recent updates to the Model S and X, and increasing Model X   production.Model X in Tesla's factory. Image source: The Motley Fool.While there are simply too many moving pieces to know exactly   how many vehicles Tesla will deliver during its fourth quarter, I   believe the company's guidance is reasonable.Investors will probably be watching Tesla's fourth-quarter   deliveries particularly close, since the figure comes as the   company is gearing up for its importantModel 3 launchlate next year. Thanks to plans for high-volume production and   deliveries of the Model 3, Tesla hopes to boost its current   annualized production run rate of 100,000 units to 500,000 units   in 2018. Investors, therefore, will want to ensure that Tesla can   hit its smaller targets today, to give more weight to the   company's more ambitious Model 3 production and delivery targets.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

What To Expect From BlackBerry's Software Unit In 2017;12/28/2016;"2017 will be all about software for BlackBerry (BBRY), as the firm shuts down its hardware operations to focus on brand licensing, while its service access business becomes increasingly irrelevant, amid user attrition from its legacy smartphone platforms. Below we take a look at what to expect from BlackBerry's software-focused businesses going into next year.Trefis has an$8 price estimate for BlackBerry, which is roughly 15% ahead of the current market price.See our complete analysis for BlackBerry     heremakeArticleAd();Enterprise Mobility Management And SecurityBlackBerry's software and services revenues stood at $486 million for the first nine months of FY'17 (fiscal years end in February), marking a 29% increase on a year-over-year basis. Enterprise mobility management remained the key driver of sales, with ~9300 new enterprise subscriber additions over the first nine months of the fiscal year. The EMM market is expected to grow from$1.76 billion in 2016 to over $4.5 billion by 2020, driven by mounting electronic security concerns and an increasing shift from PCs to mobile devices, which are often employee-owned. BlackBerry could outgrow the market, given that it recently took steps to unify its various enterprise mobility and security offerings under the ""BlackBerry Secure"" umbrella, enabling it to provide end-to-end security solutions, while helping customers lower total cost of ownership (related: What BlackBerry Aims To Achieve With Its Latest Security Offering). Moreover, roughly ~80% of BlackBerry's software and services revenue, excluding patent licensing and professional services, are now recurring after the firm transitioned to a licensing model for its EMM software. This should result in revenue growth as recent subscriber adds are monetized.Emerging Businesses Can Gain Traction,   But Competition Likely To Be IntenseThe relative revenue stability in the enterprise software space is giving BlackBerry headroom to expand its other software-oriented businesses such as connected vehicles and Internet of Things. The company recently signed an agreement to work directly with Ford Motor Company to expand its use of BlackBerry QNX and security software. The deal, which effectively makes BlackBerry a Tier-1 supplier to the auto behemoth, could pave the way for  more deals with auto manufacturers going forward (related: Why BlackBerry's Software Deal With Ford Is Promising). BlackBerry is also betting big on the car of the future, launching an Innovation Center for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, with plans to hire over 600 engineers for this effort in the near term. While the final product may be a few years away, competition in the space is likely to be intense, with deep-pocketed Silicon Valley players such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA) and Google (NASDQ:GOOG, GOOGL) investing heavily in their own respective platforms.BlackBerry's IoT business is also slowly coming to fruition. The company's Radar solution, which caters to the fleet management market, saw some business development activity this year, winning contracts with trucking firms including Caravan Transport Group in Canada and Titanium Transportation in the U.S. , while carrying out a few other pilot deployments. However, the fleet management market is very fragmented, with competition only likely to get more intense with wireless behemoth Verizon doubling down on the space with its $2.4 billion purchase of market leader Fleetmatics earlier this year. Larger players are likely to benefit from greater economies of scale and better network effects, posing a threat to BlackBerry.Looking For Greater Transparency In 2017While the growth in BlackBerry's Software business is unlikely to make up for the loss of revenue from the smartphone and SAF businesses, the greater mix of high gross margin software revenue should help BlackBerry improve its profitability. That said, there are some concerns relating to a lack of transparency for the software unit. Although software is likely to account for roughly two-thirds of BlackBerry's 2017 revenues, per our estimates, BlackBerry has not been breaking down its various software-related revenue streams, leaving some uncertainty from a forecasting standpoint. Moreover, we will be looking for the company to provide other metrics such as subscriber figures, average revenue per subscriber and churn rates, which are typical of firms providing SaaS products with recurring revenues.Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis Research"

How Tesla Can Succeed in Solar in 2017;12/28/2016;"WhenTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought SolarCity this fall, it marked a big   strategic shift for the company. Tesla is no longer just a   supplier of batteries to rooftop solar installers like SolarCity;   it is now a full-fledged solar company.SolarCity employs tens of thousands of people selling and   installing solar systems, and it is also building a manufacturing   plant and has a large financing arm that handles billions of   dollars in solar financing deals. This makes Tesla a complicated   player in solar energy, but there are three ways it can really   differentiate itself from its peers in 2017.makeArticleAd();Image source: Tesla.Manufacturing has to live up to expectationsTesla CEO Elon Musk and SolarCity have spent two years talking   about making solar cells and panels, and in 2017, the rubber has   to hit the road. When SolarCity bought Silevo in 2014 and began   construction on a 1 gigawatt (GW) solar panel manufacturing plant   in New York, the thought was that SolarCity could be a technology   leader as well as a sales and installation giant. It's been a   difficult process, to say the least.Silevo has yet to produce solar panels at scale, and when   Tesla bought SolarCity, one of the impacts was that Panasonic   would be brought in to help with solar manufacturing. None of the   companies has said a lot about what the details of Panasonic's   involvement will be, but the fact that a third party would have   to be brought in is concerning. And the time to make efficiency   advancements before competitors do is coming to a close.SolarCity thought it could make cells that were 22% efficient   with Silevo technology, which would lead to 19% to 20% efficient   modules. That would be an advance, but with mono-PERC technology   -- which will have high teens efficiency -- starting to be rolled   out by Chinese manufacturers, there's not a huge advantage to   this product SolarCity/Silevo hasn't even proven it can make. And   industry leaderSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is already producing cells that are 25.1%   efficient and modules over 23% efficiency, so the   Tesla/SolarCity/Silevo group is falling behind and has to catch   up fast.Then there's the solar roof, which is a great headline but   mostly a mystery right now. We don't know price, efficiency, or   anything about installation, so it's tough to say whether that   product will impact Tesla in 2017.What's clear is that Tesla has to get solar manufacturing   right this year. If it can, it will have a high-efficiency   product with traditional solar panels and potentially a   compelling new product with the solar roof.Ditch reliance on the leaseIn 2016, the residential solar industry came to the quick   realization that third-party financing from the lease/power   purchase agreement (PPA) won't be the dominant paradigm forever.   More loan financing is coming available and customers want the   choice that comes with self-selecting everything from panels to   financing.This takes away a key differentiator for SolarCity, which has   been able to leverage its size to lower financing costs for its   lease/PPA. Now, the company needs to make the transition to   loans, and fast. But there's opportunity here.Large installers are fairly slow in making big changes to   their business models and Tesla can be a leader in moving to the   loan. If it does, it could mean more upfront cash generation from   solar, which would fund solar manufacturing and even the Model 3   expansion. Loans could be a boon for Tesla in 2017 if it makes a   big transition and leaves its third-party financing model   behind.Image source: Tesla.Energy storage is Tesla's biggest differentiatorThe single biggest advantage Tesla has in solar is that it can   integrate design up and down the supply chain. Solar panels,   racking, inverters, and energy storage design are now all   in-house, and that could allow the company to lower costs and   offer new products to customers.In 2017, I would expect energy storage with the Powerwall 2 to   become a much larger part of the business. And with the ability   to integrate the inverter with storage, there are multiple ways   to create value for customers with energy storage. Look for the   company to leverage this fact this year.The SolarCity acquisition may have been a great moveNow that SolarCity is part of Tesla, the company has to make   the transition to a solar installer and manufacturer. In a highly   competitive industry, that may be easier said than done. But with   a high-efficiency manufacturing plant under way, scale that beats   all competitors, and an integrated energy storage product, Tesla   could be well positioned for the future. Now it just has to   execute to create value for shareholders and customers.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla-Panasonic to Manufacture Solar Cells at Buffalo Plant;12/28/2016;"Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAhas signed an agreement with Panasonic CorpPCRFYto produce photovoltaic cells and modules in Buffalo, NY, from the summer of 2017. The companies signed a non-binding letter of intent for the same in October.Per the agreement, Panasonic will bear the capital expenses needed for the plant in return for a long term purchase commitment by Tesla. The companies plan to increase the production volume of photovoltaic modules at the plant to 1 Gigawatt by 2019. Additionally, the companies will collaborate to develop the next generation of photovoltaic technology at the Fremont, CA plant of Tesla's subsidiary SolarCity.Tesla will use the cells and modules produced in the Buffalo plant to make solar panels for its non-solar roof products. The company will also use these cells in various kinds of solar glass tile roofs, when their production starts.Price MovementTesla has been underperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry for most of the year.

Tesla Leans on Panasonic to Build Solar Panels in Buffalo Plant;12/27/2016;"Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) is making good on its promise to bring in   Panasonic to help with solar manufacturing, now that Tesla's   acquisition of SolarCity is complete. The company announced   on Tuesday that Panasonic will invest $256 million in SolarCity's   Buffalo, New York, manufacturing facility, with a goal of   starting production in the summer of 2017.The hope is that the partnership will bring higher-efficiency   solar panels to SolarCity and Tesla, and a greater level of   integration. But the idea that Panasonic was needed in the first   place is a bit of a mystery.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Why Panasonic is neededIn June 2014, SolarCity announced the acquisition of Silevo, a   solar technology start-up that hoped to make high-efficiency   solar panels in a plant in Buffalo, New York. To pay for the   plant, SolarCity got the state to throw in a $750 million subsidy   in exchange for commitments to meet minimum investments and hire   workers in the state. It seemed like SolarCity was on its way to   becoming a solar manufacturing giant, with a target of production   beginning in 2016.But in the summer of 2016, as part of the acquisition of   SolarCity, Tesla announced plans to bring in Panasonic to make   solar cells using technology similar to Silevo's. It seemed that   Silevo's technology wasn't working out as planned -- if it were,   Panasonic wouldn't be needed at the plant at all.It now appears that Panasonic will essentially take over cell   manufacturing using its own technology, which adds a thin   amorphous silicon layer to the cell to increase   efficiency. What's interesting about moving to this   technology is that Panasonic suspended operations at a solar-cell   plant in Osaka, Japan, because of weak demand. If the technology   was a true differentiator on efficiency at competitive costs, the   company could have looked outside Japan to markets like the U.S.,   where high efficiency is in high demand. But Panasonic's   technology wasn't differentiated enough to thrive on the open   market, so it's interesting that Tesla chose Panasonic as   the partner for Buffalo.Tesla has a bigger plan for solar cellsTesla hopes the Buffalo plant will help advance   higher-efficiency solar panels that pack more power generation   into each rooftop solar install, and will provide cells for   Tesla's solar roof. This will also further vertically integrate   the manufacturing business. Tesla now designs and makes solar   panels, roof racking, and an energy storage product with an   inverter. In theory, having development of these products   under one roof should make for a more seamless design and install   for Tesla.For Tesla to differentiate itself from competitors in solar,   this integration will be key. And the Buffalo facility could be   where Tesla's solar vision comes together.Tesla has a lot to prove in solarSaying you're going to make a high-efficiency solar panel or a   solar roof is one thing, but actually doing it is apparently   proving more difficult than Elon Musk and SolarCity had planned.   Panasonic wouldn't have been asked to invest $256 million in the   Buffalo solar facility if Silevo's technology were working as   expected. And we still don't have confirmation that solar panels   coming from the facility will be higher-efficiency than those   from competitors, or cost-competitive.Making solar panels is easier said than done. Tesla bringing   in Panasonic shows that Silevo/SolarCity/Tesla are finding that   out the hard way.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Is Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Have a Bang-Up Year;12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's been a decidedly tough year for athletic apparel makers, and despite making several strategic moves to set itself up for the future,Under Armour Inc(NYSE:UA, NYSE:UAA) was no exception.Source:SandyDover via Flickr (Modified)UAA stock is down nearly 30% on the year, and the firm's Class C shares have lost a whopping 40% in 2016.makeArticleAd();Looking at those figures, you might think you were dealing with a company that has very little hope for the future, but in fact Under Armour appears to have a relatively bright future, making it a good buy at its current valuation.What Happened to UA StockA few key events led to UA stock's declines over the past year, but the majority of them are unlikely to keep shares of Under Armour depressed for long.In early December, Under Armour's ticker symbol changed and that contributed to the decline in the stock price as investors shied away from the company due to confusion over which shares were which and questions regarding management's decision to have three separate share classes.10 Best Stocks for Retirement InvestorsBack in April, UA introduced a new C class of stock with the ticker symbol UA.C. These shares had all the same economic value as the A class shares, but shareholders would have no voting rights. CEO Kevin Plank also created a third class of B stock that does carry voting rights, but only he holds these shares. Essentially what the stock split did was allow UA to issue new stock without Plank giving up his majority stake in the company.If this wasn't confusing enough, Under Armour thenrenamedit's class C shares to just ""UA"" rather than ""UA.C,"" and the A shares (which used to be named ""UA"") became ""UAA"" at the beginning of December.While it was a contributing factor, confusion wasn't the entire reason that UA stock tumbled this year. Under Armour also faced some pretty worrying headwinds that caused investors to second guess whether the company could remain relevant in the years to come.Perhaps the most worrying event was the bankruptcy and closure of Sports Authority, which hit UA hard because the distributor was Under Armour's largest seller. Sports Authority's troubles hurt UA's bottom line and weighed on investor sentiment. Many pointed to the bankruptcy as a sign of things to come within the sector.Finally, despite a third-quarter earnings-beat, Under Armour's results were less than perfect. The firm's margins declined and third-quarter sales growth was at a six-year low. Fourth-quarter guidance suggested that the final quarter's sales growth would be even slower as well.Why You Should Buy UA StockWith three major events contributing to UA and UAA stock's decline in 2016, there's a lot of reason to believe that things are looking bright for the new year. Even without considering all the things that UA has done to set itself up for a profitable future, UA stock is poised to gain.UA's losses resulting from investor confusion over the stock split and new ticker symbols are unlikely to have a lasting impact. As the confusion begins to fade, UA stock will stabilize.This is especially true for the C class shares, which are a great buy as they are trading at a discount. The voting rights that make A shares more valuable are negligible for traders, as Plank has majority control no matter what, so C shares are a good buy for investors who see UA improving in the coming year.The Sports Authority closure was certainly a blow to UA's momentum, but it doesn't signal an athletic-wear apocalypse as many traders feared. It's worrying, but other similar retailers likeDicks Sporting Goods Inc(NYSE:DKS) are stillthriving, so it isn't time to panic about the industry's stability just yet.UA's sales issues are also a concern, but the company isn't in danger of falling apart, so a few difficult quarters shouldn't be reason to write UA stock off completely. Sales have improved by at least 20% every quarter for nearly a decade, and that is a pretty positive sign of stability.Better Days Ahead for UAOnce you've addressed the three biggest reasons UA stock is down in the dumps, the case for a marked increase in the next year looks promising. Not only are some of the market's worries about Under Armour overdone, but the firm has also made some strategic moves this year that have put it in a good position for 2017.One of the biggest moves the company made this year was stepping into the athleisure market. Athletic wear has made it's way into the closets of just about everyone whether or not they've ever set foot in the gym. Under Armour's product line has always been aimed at athletes with clothing that is designed for performance rather than style.However, the firmrecently unveileda new line of apparel that focuses on casual athletic wear for the masses. This is a segment that is likely to continue growing in the coming year, so it's promising to see UA throwing its hat in the athleisure ring. This push into casual-wear is likely to be supported by Under Armour's new partnership withKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS), another big factor to watch in the coming year.The Bottom LineUA stock is a buy for investors looking to add to their portfolio in the coming year. The stock's major decline in 2016 has been the result of the market's overreaction to some challenges that the company is facing.Should I Buy Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock? 3     Pros, 3 ConsNot only can investors expect much of that downside to fade in the coming year, but UA's latest foray into casual wear is likely to give the stock a further boost.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to Own10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for     2017The postThis Is Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Have a Bang-Up Yearappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Should I Buy Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs should be no surprise,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) had another eventful year.Source:Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)The company dealt withproduction issueswith the Model X as demand surged. Then there was the mega acquisition of SolarCity, as well as the announcement of nearly 400,000 advance deposits for the Model 3.makeArticleAd();Now, fresh off of the holiday season, traders are bidding Tesla stock up on a deal withPanasonic Corporation (ADR)(OTCMKTS:PCRFY)to dropmore than 30 billion yen(about $256 million USD) on a Tesla production facility to make photovoltaic cells and modules.Today's 3%-plus move exemplifies the broader theme - TSLA stock is erratic. In 2016, Tesla had a range of $144 to $265 - with the year-to-date loss coming to 8%. That's disappointing considering the markets have ended the year on a very bullish note. It's important to keep in mind, however, that Tesla stock has had a long run of strong gains. During the past five years, compound annual growth hit a staggering 50%.10 Best Stocks for Retirement InvestorsSo what kind of opportunity are we looking at with Tesla stock? Well, to see, let's consider three pros and cons on Tesla stock.TSLA Stock ProsInnovation:Tesla Motors has made major breakthroughs in battery technologies (allowing for drives of over 300 miles on a single charge), electric powertrains and software systems. Yet the company has also been innovative with its business model, such as having online purchases of vehicles as well company-owned showrooms and service centers. The result is that Tesla has direct connections with its customers and better control on quality service.Interestingly enough, a Tesla car is kind of like an app. That is, there are periodic updates to the systems with""over-the-air""transmissions. This has definitely been key with the Autopilot technology, which allows for semi-autonomous driver assistance. So is it any wonder thatForbescurrently ranks Tesla asthe world's most innovative company? Not really.Megatrend:The auto industry is in the midst of major technology changes. Companies likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) have made big investments and acquisitions in the category. Of course, the main focus is on autonomous driving. According to research fromMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY), the market could hit$15 billionwithin the next few years.All this is certainly good news for holders of TSLA stock. The company has been investing in new-fangled auto technologies since 2003. What's more, the Autopilot hardware has logged over 1.3 billion miles so far. In other words, Tesla has a major advantage in terms of data and analytics. But the growth is likely to ramp for some time. For the second half of 2016, TSLA expects to ship50,000 cars, which is roughly the same amount for all of last year.The Elon Factor:At 45, Musk is already a legend of the tech industry. Besides Tesla, he has launched other breakout companies, such as Zip2,Paypal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL), SolarCity and SpaceX. Along the way, Musk has made billions for shareholders. Unlike many in Silicon Valley, though, he is not only technically super smart but has incredible marketing chops. Oh, and he is not afraid of ""going big."" Let's face it, how many people have the goal of eventually living on Mars? Such qualities have inspired Musk's workforce, which has led to amazing achievements.TSLA Stock ConsSolarCity Deal:OnTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), Musk sent out thefollowingregarding the acquisition: ""Tesla + SolarCity future: solar roofs + batteries + electric cars."" Definitely ambitious, right? Of course. But there has still been quite a bit of skepticism on the Street.One of the issues is that SolarCity has been a big-time money loser. For the past year, the company has reported nearly$2 billion in negative operating cash flows. Keep in mind that there are heavy capital costs and marketing expenditures. The competitive environment is also intense and there are concerns that the regulatory environment could get tougher. Let's face it, the Donald Trump Administration may not be too interested in maintaining tax credits for solar energy projects.In light of all this, analysts at Morgan Stanley provided the followinggrim assessment: ""Given (SolarCity's) financial condition and recent reduction in guidance, we have assumed zero value for (SolarCity) equity to (Tesla) shareholders.""Valuation:Even with the recent drop, TSLA stock is still far from cheap. The multiple is at about six times sales. No doubt, this is at quite a premium to traditional auto manufacturers. Consider thatGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) sport multiples at about 0.3 or so.It's true that the premium valuation for TSLA is due to the strong growth ramp. And there is lots of value for the intellectual property. But then again, profitability has remained elusive. If anything, TSLA will likely continue to voraciously raise capital to meet production targets, build the massive Gigafactory and fund SolarCity. In other words, there will likely be ongoing dilution for shareholders.Perhaps this is why short sellers have been targeting TSLA stock. Right now, the short interest is at a hefty 40% of the float, which certainly indicates that many investors are expecting a fall in the value of the shares.Production Issues:Demand has not really been a problem for Tesla. Instead, the real challenge has been to produce enough vehicles. After all, the company has a limited number of facilities - and technical complexities are mind-boggling. It seems inevitable that there will be snags. Yet the biggest problem may be to achieve profitability on a unit basis. According to a recent 152-slide presentation from hedge fund managerMark Spiegel, the Tesla Model 3 could cost $48,000 to produce. However, the company has plans to sell it at $35,000!All in all, this seems like a pretty good deal for customers - but not for holders of TSLA stock. Granted, TSLA may ultimately decide to hike the price. But this could mean a drop in sales. No doubt, this essentially highlights the extreme difficulties of succeeding in the mass market.Bottom Line on TSLA StockMusk has always had many doubters - and he has had a knack for proving them wrong. And so far, he has done a tremendous job with TSLA. It's actually downright amazing that he was somehow able to stave off bankruptcy during the financial crisis.How to Protect Yourself in Bank of America Corp     (BAC) StockBut going forward, TSLA will deal with its biggest challenges - such as selling into the mass market and also managing a solar energy company. Just doing one would be incredibly tough. In other words, there is really not much margin for error.OK then, should you buy Tesla stock? No, not for now - the risks just seem to high, especially in light of the valuation.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you   canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Will Tesla's (TSLA) Share Price Rebound In 2017?;12/27/2016;"Tesla Motors, Inc.'sTSLAstock, which was once a market favorite, has been underperforming this year. The share price had surged 344.1% in 2013 and 47.9% in 2014. However, the increase slowed down to 7.9% in 2015.The stock has lost 11.1% so far this year. Tesla has been facing production related issues for a long time, as a result of which it has failed to meet delivery targets in the first two quarters of 2016. This, along with the losses incurred by the company, pulled down its share price. Tesla's stock was also affected by the announcement of the SolarCity acquisition, due to concerns regarding the losses of the latter, debts and cash outflow.As a result, Tesla has been underperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry for most of the year. Year to date, the industry witnessed a 2.9% gain, which is in sharp contrast to the losses recorded by Tesla.Is a Rebound on the Cards?Tesla will belaunching its first affordable car, Model 3, in 2017, aiding the company to rebound, provided the launch is on schedule. The biggest criticism against the company has been its consistent losses. CEO Elon Musk is of the opinion that Tesla is unlikely to achieve sustained net profits until Model 3 enters its full-scale production.While the company's expansion into the battery storage business helped it to lower losses to some extent, a change in the earnings reporting method helped it post a profit in the third quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, the company is still expected to record losses in 2016 and 2017.Thus, the successful launch of Model 3 will play a key role in determining Tesla's performance next year. Since its partial unveiling, the car has seen strong demand and the company is likely to need at least an year to fulfill the number of pre-orders it has received. This means that Tesla's plan to increase production capacity also needs to be achieved on schedule. The company is planning to complete the acquisition of Grohmann Engineering early next year to help it reach the production capacity goals.Apart from Model 3, Tesla's energy business will also play an important role in determining its profitability. While the Tesla Energy business is already generating positive gross margins, thelaunch of the new solar roof shinglesmight further augment the profitability.Tesla also hasseveral products in development stage, including heavy-duty trucks, to be named Tesla Semi, and high passenger-density urban transport, i.e. minibuses. It is also developing a compact SUV, to be named Model Y.Additionally, Tesla plans to charge a small fee for the use of its Superchargers from customers who purchase a Model X or Model S after Jan 1, 2017. Though revenues from this source will be limited, it is likely to augment the bottom line.The recentacquisition of SolarCityis expected to help Tesla attain savings of $150 million in 2017. However, the addition of SolarCity's debts and cash outflows will increase the strain on Tesla's financials.Moreover, Tesla is investing heavily in increasing its production capacity, the development of Model X and Model 3, the Gigafactory construction and expansion of sales, services and Supercharger infrastructure. As a result, itsexpenses are expected to remain highin 2017, which will weigh on the bottom line.Overall, with several positive developments lined up, Tesla's stock is likely to perform well in 2017. The shares might get a boost if the company posts positive fourth quarter earnings report. However, a lot more depends on the timely launch of Model 3 and expansion of its non-automotive business.TESLA MOTORS PriceTESLA MOTORS Price|TESLA MOTORS QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3 Stocks to Watch on Tuesday: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL), Apple Inc (AAPL) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA);12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIt was a quiet weekend, with most companies celebrating the   holiday period by making any announcements they may have before   the weekend or later in the week. However, there were a few   companies making headlines over the weekend.These includeAmerican Airlines Group Inc(NASDAQ:AAL),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).makeArticleAd();Here's how they did:American Airlines Group Inc (AAL)American Airlinesexperienced some inner strifewithin the company's workforce.The company faced some backlash from the union that represents   its pilots as line pilots are slated to be offered profit sharing   payments amounting to 3% of their 2016 salaries, while its   management pilots will rake in 55%.About 15,000 American Airlines pilots are represented by the   union. As far as management pilot goes, the largest payout could   amount to about $192,000.The company responded by noting that there are two types of   pilots that are being bunched together by the union, one of which   reap the benefits of a profit-sharing plan established in   March.The other is a management-based incentive program that kicks   in if the company nets $3.5 billion in the year, but individual   performances are also assessed with the plan.AAL shares are up 15.1% year-to-date.Apple Inc (AAPL)Apple is releasing three phones in the near future,the company announced.The tech giant revealed that it is celebrating the tenth   anniversary of its flagship smartphone with the launch of   upgraded versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Bank of America Corp (BAC) and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA);12/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street   remains relatively barren. While the markets are open for   business, many traders will remain on holiday break through the   start of next year. The 20,000 mark for theDow Jones Industrial Averageremains a dream for many bulls, however, and the blue-chip   barometer has a slim chance of topping that hurdle due to light   volume this week.At last check, futures on the Dow were up 0.02%, withS&P 500futures up 0.12%.Nasdaq-100futures were also up by 0.14%.makeArticleAd();On the options front, volume was well below average on Dec. 23   - the last trading session ahead of the Christmas break. Only   about 8.2 million calls and 7.9 million puts changed hands on the   session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume   ratio dipped to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average ticked   higher to 0.63.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) saw an unusual level of put volume on Friday after Consumer   Reports snubbed the new MacBook Pro. Elsewhere,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) unloaded the last of its international credit card business toLloyds Banking Group PLC (ADR)(NYSE:LYG) andTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was upgraded at Vetr.Apple Inc. (AAPL)AAPL stock may be in for a spot of short-term weakness, if the   worsening sentiment in the options pits is any indication. On   Friday, AAPL saw more than 603,000 contracts cross the tape - a   considerable accomplishment given the overall low volume on the   day. What's disturbing is that puts claimed the majority of the   day's activity with 51% of the take.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017With any other stock, this wouldn't be much of an issue, but   with AAPL, which typically sees calls account for 63% to 64% of   daily volume, it was a considerable sentiment blow. Additionally,   there was news driving the added put volume, asConsumer Reports tested the new MacBook Proand failed to give the laptop a ""recommended"" buy rating - the   first time any Apple MacBook has failed to grab the coveted   rating.With AAPL stock trading just below resistance at $116, and   sentiment sliding, we could see considerable selling pressure on   the shares once the rest of Wall Street returns to work next   week.Bank of America Corp (BAC)BAC continues to ride high among both stock and options   traders.  The shares saw option volume rise to 375,000   contracts on Friday, with calls making up 66% of the day's   activity. What's more, according toTrade-Alert.com, BAC's weekly December 30 strike 24 calls attracted significant   call buying activity, with a block of 5,000 contracts crossing at   the strike for the ask price of a penny, or $1.00 per   contract.The play seems highly speculative - especially given the   holiday shortened trading week - but there are several drivers   that could help vault BAC to fresh highs.For instance, Bank of America announced that it is unloading   the last of its international credit card interestto Lloyds Banking Group for $2.35 billion. The sale marks the end of BofA's activity in the international   credit card market, and the company can now focus its efforts on   its core businesses. Speaking of which, Bank of America's   investing unit is looking at three potential rate hikes from the   Federal Reserve in 2017.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)TSLA stock received a double bump last week - one sentiment   and one technical. On the sentiment front,Vetr upgraded TSLA stockto ""hold"" from ""sell."" While the move drew little fanfare, it was   enough to spark technical buying as the shares topped resistance   at $210. Tesla is now pinned against its 200-day moving average -   a trendline the shares last closed a session above in August.Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.       (ULTA) Stock Is GlisteningA breakout here could be quite bullish for the shares, and   TSLA options traders appear to be banking on the move. On Friday,   Tesla saw volume of more than 203,000 contracts, with calls   snapping up 53% of the day's take, which, given traders' recent   preference for TSLA puts, is a significant shift in sentiment for   the shares.Looking out to January 2017 options, peak call open interest   lies at $230, totaling roughly 10,680 contracts. The next closest   significant call accumulation numbers 5,800 contracts at $220. In   other words, there is little in the way of overhead   options-related resistance to slow TSLA down should the shares   finally reclaim their 200-day trendline.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for       2017The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017The postTuesday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

2 Big Winners in Consumer Reports' Owner Satisfaction Survey;12/27/2016;"It's easy for investors to become completely consumed by a   company's financials, and that's obviously an important aspect of   investing. But wise investors also pay a lot of attention to the   products their companies make, because a product mistake or   failure could send a promising company's stock crashing to the   ground.That's why reading through Consumer Reports' Annual Owner   Satisfaction Survey can be really important for auto investors:   It tells us how CR subscribers feel about the cars they bought.   I'd much rather own a financially healthy stock that produces   vehicles consumers would buy again, than not.Lincoln's rebound isn't limited to sales as its consumer   satisfaction jumped this year. Image source: Ford Motor   Company.makeArticleAd();How does it work?CR's rankings emphasize owner sentiment across a brand's   entire portfolio of vehicles and model satisfaction is determined   by the percentage of subscribers that would ""definitely"" buy the   vehicle again. Also, in order to qualify, a brand must have at   least two models with data and the survey focused on 2014-2017   model years. Without further ado, here are the results and some   takeaways.Information source: Consumer Reports'Ownership Satisfaction Survey. Chart by author.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is obviously a huge winner here as the only brand   scoring in the 90 percentile range, and well ahead of the next   closest brand, Porsche, and that's even more impressive   considering the latter was the only brand scoring in the 80   percentile range. But Tesla's victory here is even more important   considering the battering it's taken over the past year in   regards to production issues.The Model X's wing doors caused consumer frustration, and   occasional issues of doors not aligning properly aren't typical   complaints for a car that can cost well into the $100,000 range.   The fact that so many Tesla consumers would purchase again   despite the production complaints is a huge win, and that's   amplified by the fact that it's more affordable Model 3 will be   launching at the end of 2017.Ford Motor Company's(NYSE: F) luxury Lincoln brand made an impressive jump for the   second-largest Detroit automaker. Lincoln jumped from its 21st   ranking in the prior CR survey, up to 12th this year. That moved   Lincoln ahead of some notable luxury brands such as Cadillac,   Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. Remember, Lincoln was the only brand that   Ford didn't sell off amid its business crisis in 2006, and the   following financial crisis. It's poured much capital into   reviving the luxury brand and it's now on pace for its third   consecutive year of sales gains, something it hasn't accomplished   in at least 16 years.This is a great sign for Ford investors as luxury sales are   high margin business, and increasing luxury sales at a time when   new-vehicle sales are peaking would be very beneficial for the   automaker. If more consumers are happy with the product, and   would purchase again as this survey indicates, this suggests   Lincoln's newest products are improved and that should enable the   brand's rebound to continue.Ultimately, these types of surveys are more important to   investors than many realize. The automotive business is insanely   competitive, and it's very costly to ""conquer"" consumers, which   is luring them from a competing brand to your own. If you have a   high percentage of consumers remaining loyal to your brand, it's   simply good business. These surveys can also give a glimpse of a   company that might not be producing vehicles up to standards, and   that could lead to sales troubles in the near-term. TakeFiat Chrysler Automobilesfor example, which had four of its five brands place 17th or   lower.

Will Elon Musk Really Build a Tunnel Boring Company?;12/25/2016;"So here's the latest revelation pulled out of ""Elon Musk's box   of crazy ideas."" The founder ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and SpaceX has now decided to start a company that   will dig tunnels for cars to drive through.Tunnel boring machines are massive pieces of equipment --   train-sized mobile factories designed to dig into the Earth.   Coincidentally, they're almost perfectly shaped to fit aboard a   rocket to Mars. Image source: Getty Images.We first learned of Musk's latest harebrained scheme (Get it?   Rabbits dig tunnels. too!) when the Tesla CEO was apparently   driving through California over the weekend, got upset with the   holiday-time traffic, and began blasting out a series of   tweets:makeArticleAd();""Traffic is driving me nuts,"" observed the billionaire.So maybe he should ""build a tunnel boring machine and just   start digging.""He would call the company ""The Boring Company"" -- and he is   ""actually going to do this.""A hare among foxesMedia response to the Tesla tycoon's tweets has been mixed,   withUSA Todayobserving that these may be the mere ""musings of a guy stuck in a   traffic jam with time to tweet,"" andRecode.net theorizingthat Elon was ""just venting,"" or perhaps ""making a corny   joke.""Others, including some of my own colleagues here at The Motley   Fool, believe that Musk is serious about setting up a ""boring   company"" -- but that he's deluded if he thinks he can make it   work. After all, while the idea of boring tunnels in the earth   appears to have just occurred to Musk, there are plenty of other   companies that have been at this business much longer.Just a quick survey of the tunnel boring machine (TBM)   industry reveals major players in the form of:Norway's TerratecGermany's Bosch RexrothGermany's Herrenknecht, which makes the TBMs building out     the London UndergroundJapan's Hitachi Zosen Sakai, which makes the Bertha     TBM currently tunneling under SeattleChina Rail Engineering CorporationFrance's NFM Technologies and America's The Robbins     Company, both now owned  by China's Northern Heavy     Industries GroupIf Elon Musk truly desires to enter the tunnel boring   business, he's going to face some stiff competition --   competition stiff enough that it's already drivenCaterpillar(NYSE: CAT) out of the business. (Caterpillar stopped building   TBMs in 2013, and is winding down its support of existing   equipment at the end of this year.) So if Musk truly is serious   about setting up a tunnel boring company, he's picked himself a   tough row to hoe.Crazy as a March hare -- or crazy like a fox?And yet, I actually think Muskisserious -- and what's more, I think I knowwhyhe's serious about tunnel boring. It comes down to this:   Everything -- everything -- that Musk does these days is done   with an eye to his dream ofone day colonizing Mars.Consider: Musk has famously advocated the idea of launching   satellites into orbit, and thenreusing the rockets. Previously, advocates of reusable rockets always argued that   the best way to land rockets for reuse was to fly them back to   Earth and land them like an airplane, on a runway. That's how   Rockwell International (now largely owned byBoeing) designed its space shuttle. That's how Boeing rivalAirbusis designingits ADELINE spaceplaneto land today.Musk, however, rightly points out that on Mars, thereare no runways.If you want to land a rocket on Mars, such that it can later take   off again, you have to land ""on your feet."" Hence, every rocket   that Musk makes at SpaceX is designed to land vertically, on its   own rockets.You can make a similar point for Musk's other business   ventures, includingSolarCity solar panels, Teslaelectric cars, and evensatellite internet. Mars lacks oil deposits, which means that power must be   generated electrically (solar panels). Mars cars won't be able to   run on gasoline, so battery power is a better option there as   well (Tesla). And Mars will lack a communications system to   connect potentially far-flung colonies -- so it might be a good   idea to develop expertise in running a satcom network here on   Earth, preparatory to creating a similar system to encircle   Mars.Making sense of Elon Musk's Boring CompanySo how do tunnel boring machines play into this Mars-centric   thesis? Simple. In the early days of any Mars colony, protecting   colonists from solar radiation will be a concern, as will   construction of housing. Having tunnel boring machines on site,   however, would solve both problems at once, by enabling colonists   to bore radiation-proof tunnels underground in which to live.Mind you, I'm not saying that this is Musk'sonlyobjective in setting up a company to build TBMs. Rather, it's hisultimateobjective.As I see it, Musk needs to figure out how to build TBMs --   which he can then ship to Mars by rocket, for use in setting up a   Mars colony. To do that, he'll want to first tinker with the   idea, learn how to build TBMs himself, and then perfect the   technology. By setting up a ""Boring Company"" on Earth, he gets to   do all three -- and have his customers (and perhaps even   investors) pay for it.When you look at things this way, Musk's idea isn't nearly as   crazy as it sounds.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;12/23/2016;"The end of the year is usually quiet for most businesses, but   for the solar industry it can be a time of big changes.   Legislation and regulatory changes are often pushed through just   before the end of the year, which has had a huge impact on the   solar industry in years past.2016 is no different, and there are some significant policy   changes taking place right now. But this time solar energy may be   coming out on top. Here's a look at those policy changes and some   other notable items from the week in solar energy.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.A record year for U.S. solarDespite solar stocks' performance on the market, the industry   had a record year in 2016. The U.S. Energy Information   Administration (EIA) says that 9.5 GW of utility-scale solar will   be installed in the U.S. this year, enough to power 1.5 million   homes. That tops 8.0 GW of new natural gas plants and 6.8 GW of   new wind power.If you add in distributed solar generation, which the EIA   doesn't account for, the figure jumps to 11.2 GW or 14 GW of DC   power generation,according to GTM Research. The future is bright for solar energy, and as the biggest   source of new power generation in the country, it's finally a   power player in electricity generation.States can't figure out what to do with solarThe rooftop solar industry is very dependent on state and   regulator policies driving the economics of solar systems. Under   net metering, customers only pay for their net energy usage,   meaning they're effectively ""paid"" the retail rate for energy   they export to the grid. Not surprisingly, utilities have tried   to undercut that economic model in a variety of ways over the   last few years.This week, Arizona undercut net metering by lowering the rate   customers are paid for electricity sent to the grid, and cutting   down the amount of time rates are guaranteed. This reduces the   known payback of a solar system and could make it difficult to   justify rooftop solar.In Nevada, the state that eliminated net metering a year ago   in a very punitive way to the solar industry, the Public   Utilities Commission unanimously approved utility Sierra Pacific   Power's bid to restore net metering in the northern part of the   state. This is a big reversal in Nevada, and may show that   regulators went too far in their ruling last year.Utilities in the southwestern U.S. are finding themselves in a   difficult position as the cost of rooftop solar falls and energy   storage becomes more viable. They're trying to undercut the   economics of solar, but by doing so they're making solar plus   storage a viable option for self-consumption. It's no coincidence   that this is the yearTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) introduced new or improved energy-storage products.   Utilities are having a hard time finding a balance between   fighting rooftop solar and fighting so hard they push customers   toward solar plus storage. And that conflict is playing out in   plain sight in Arizona and Nevada right now.News and notesHere are a few notable items from around the solar   industry.Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) said this week that it hit a new efficiency record of   22.61% for a monocrystalline silicon PERC cell. Mono-PERC, as   it's more commonly known, is an up-and-coming technology that   will likely gain market share in the next few years, so being in   a leadership position is good for the company.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) said it completed a 20 MW power plant for the   Sulphur Springs Valley Electric Cooperative this week. The   project completion itself isn't surprising, but buried in the   release is that 0.5 MW of the installation was the company's   Oasis 3.0 platform that was launched in September. Putting the   system in the ground will both give SunPower the chance to test   installing it, and allow data to be collected from the project.   Since it is probably the company's most important product over   the next five years, this is an important test site for the   company.Private company 8minutenergy Renewables also completed a 155   MW project that it says beats fossil-fuel prices and is the   lowest-cost solar power to date. The $58 per MWh it is charging   the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for electricity   over a 30-year power purchase agreement is impressive, and it's   just one example of low-cost solar in the U.S. New contracts are   going for less than $50 per MWh, and 2017 could see prices below   $40 per MWh, which would make solar energy lower-cost than fossil   fuels in most of the country.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla (TSLA) Increases Deutsche Bank Credit Lines by $500M;12/23/2016;"Shares ofTesla Motors, Inc.TSLAfell 0.5% to close at $207.70 on Dec 21, after the electric carmaker announced that it has increased two credit lines with Deutsche Bank by a total of $500 million. This increase comes only a couple of months after CEO Elon Musk stated that the company would not need to raise any additional capital or debt in the fourth quarter of 2016 (read more:Tesla Unlikely to Raise Capital in 2016 for Proposed Merger).However, on Dec 15, Tesla amended the ABL Credit Agreement, dated Jun 10, 2015, with Deutsche Bank. As a result, the revolving credit under the agreement has increased by $200 million with provisions to raise it by another $50 million. The company's subsidiaries Tesla Finance LLC and Tesla 2014 Warehouse SPV LLC also amended the Loan and Security Agreement, dated Aug 31, 2016, with Deutsche Bank to increase the maximum facility limit under the agreement by $300 million. Under this agreement, Tesla was earlier allowed to borrow up to $300 million for its direct vehicle leasing program till Aug 31, 2017.Price MovementTesla has been underperforming the Zacks categorizedAuto Manufacturers-Domesticindustry for most of the year.

Do Lithium Stocks Belong in Your Portfolio?;12/23/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.The case for lithium stocks seems simple enough. The world is   adding new portable electric devices at an incredible pace. Just   about every major automaker has at least announced plans for   introducing an electric vehicle to the market within a matter of   years. A little company calledTeslais moving forward on construction of a Gigafactory that will   produce an enormous number of batteries for autos and home-scale   energy storage -- it expects to produce as many lithium-ion   batteries in 2018 as were manufactured on the whole planet in   2013. Phones, laptops, power tools, wearables, drones -- it seems   everything and anything is taking advantage of advances in   lithium-ion technology.makeArticleAd();That means lithium stocks belong in your portfolio, right? As   is usually the case, the details of the market make this simple   argument a little more complicated. Here are a few things   investors will want to consider before throwing money at the   companies supplying this headline-grabbing metal.The lithium market by the numbersEveryone thinks of batteries when they think of lithium.   However, while that is by far the fastest-growing use for the   metal, batteries only account for about one-third of the total   lithium market. They only became the largest category of   consumption last year, when they moved ahead of ceramics and   glass.Image source:USGS.Counterintuitively, global production of lithium ore hasn't   grown all that much in recent years, although mining companies   are planning on major output increases in the near future. The   U.S. Geological Survey concluded that 2013 output topped out at   34,000 metric tons, then fell to 31,700 metric tons in 2014.   Production of raw ore is estimated to have grown by just 500   metric tons in 2015.Sluggish production growth is not a matter of scarcity. Global   output could triple and known reserves would still last about 135   years. The question iswhether or not lithium suppliers can keep up(more on that below) with rising demand. This should be the focus   of investors interested in lithium stocks.Lithium market structureThere are plenty of tiny, zero-revenue stocks out there   claiming to have vast reserves of untapped lithium ore. These are   the crazy Uncle Joes of the market. Smile, nod, and then turn   your attention to the suppliers with real market share.Albemarle Corp.(NYSE: ALB) ,Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile(NYSE: SQM) , andFMC Corp.(NYSE: FMC) own a combined 70% of the global lithium market.   China's Tianqi Lithium owns another 16%. These diverse specialty   chemical companies buy up the rights to unmined lithium and   convert it into more refined grades that are suitable for   downstream customers, such as battery manufacturers.These companies are only real way to gain exposure to the   market. There is no reliable pure play lithium stock. Why not?   Mining lithium is an awfully slow and laborious operation.Consider that some 80% of global lithium reserves are to be   found in salt brines in South America, namely Chile and   Argentina, with over half of the world's reserves residing in the   former. Getting the raw lithium out of brine requires multiple   concentration, extraction, and purification steps to separate out   various other metal impurities. The first step alone -- solar   evaporation ponds -- takesfour months. The next several steps are energy and consumable intensive,   which hikes  the cost of production.Image source:Outotec.To put it another way: Uncle Joe isn't going to make it in   lithium mining. The process is long and expensive, which prevents   suppliers from responding rapidly to shifts in demand. Only large   companies such as Albemarle, SQM, and FMC have the financial   power to withstand volatility, diversify their supply chains, and   make the necessary investments to create high grade lithium   materials for industrial customers. Of course, market volatility   has worked in their favor in the last year.Supply and demandNow that I've convinced you to stay away from microcap lithium   stocks, you're ready to load up on the blue chips. After all, the   growing demand for batteries and the sluggish rises in raw ore   output (a year-over-year increase in output of just 500 metric   tons) must give the four major market players the upper hand in   negotiating supply deals with battery manufacturers, right?Sort of.ALBdata byYChartsIt goes without saying that lithium is pretty important in   lithium-ion batteries. But, counterintuitively, the lithium does   not have a significant impact on the cost of lithium-ion   batteries. In fact, it's actually the smallest mass and cost   component of the battery cells. Earlier this year, two   researchers at Carnegie Mellon University did a study that played   around with the price of lithium carbonate (raw lithium ore),   using a base price of $7.50 per kilogram. Dropping the price to   $0 and increasing it to $25 per kilogram -- an increase of 233%   --changed the cost of batteries by less than   10%.In other words, there isn't much bargaining power to gain from   keeping the market undersupplied, but the lengthy production   process for lithium has kept supply lagging behind demand in the   last several years. That has resulted in rising prices, which   have been a boon for the Big Four in 2016. Here's how lithium   contributed to the finances of Albemarle and FMC for the first   nine months of 2016:MetricAlbemarleFMCRevenue, lithium$689.9 million*$193.5 million% of Total Revenue34.8%*8%Income, lithium$186.3 million (net income)*$48.9 million**% of Total Income32.6% (net income)*12.1%***Includes other materials. **Income before taxes. Source: SEC   filings.In its financial reports, Albemarle lumps lithium sales in   with other advanced materials it sells, but lithium is clearly   driving the segment. The year-over-year sales increase for the   segment was all from favorable conditions in the lithium market,   which offset declining revenue from other products. FMC has seen   a significant leap in lithium sales compared to 2015, too, and   has announced major expansion plans to increase output before the   end of the decade.Keep in mind that the lengthy production process is a   double-edged sword. If demand for raw lithium suddenly craters,   perhaps in a global economic downturn or from the emergence of   new mining technology, then major suppliers will be nearly two   quarters behind the market's appetite. A similar scenario could   unfold if other major mining or chemical companies decide to   invest in production or the overall supply chain. Either case   could crash prices and the income statements of lithium stocks in   one fell swoop. That doesn't appear likely at the moment, but   similar scenarios have played out many times in commodities   markets when no one saw it coming in advance. (See: fertilizers,   crude oil, and the like.)Do lithium stocks belong in your portfolio?Investors will want to take the issues outlined above   into consideration before making a decision to gain exposure   to lithium, either directly through a supplier such as Albemarle   or indirectly through an ETF. In the end, the lithium market   is more complex than most people realize. I'm firmly in the camp   that thinks lithium stocks are simply the flavor the week for Mr.   Market and do not represent a long-term buying opportunity.   Perhaps when supply chains mature and prices reach more of an   equilibrium, I'll reconsider my position. But for now, lithium   stocks do not belong in my portfolio.10 stocks we like better than FMCWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Is Closer to Deploying Its Enhanced Autopilot;12/22/2016;"When electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) launched its next-generation suite of Autopilot   sensors in October, there was one immediate caveat in the big   update: Tesla vehicles with the new hardware would temporarily   lack key Autopilot features already in cars with its   first-generation sensor suite. Missing abilities even included   important safety features like automatic emergency braking and   collision warning. Tesla said it would need to further calibrate   the system before it caught Autopilot 2.0 up with Autopilot 1.0.   But the new system is almost ready, according to a tweet from   Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday.Tesla demonstrates Autopilot 2.0 sensors. Image source: Tesla   Motors.makeArticleAd();Validation""Tesla Autopilot vision neural net now working well,"" Musk   said onTwitter, referencing the new system's onboard computer, which has 40   times the computing power of its predecessor and runs the   company's Tesla Vision neural-net software (developed   in-house) for sonar and radar processing. ""Just need to get   a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of   environments.""In late November, Musk said Tesla would begin rolling out   updates for its new Autopilot sensors to catch the new technology   up with the capabilities of its existing sensor suite in   December. The updates, Musk tweeted, ""will get rolled out   incrementally in monthly releases.""Tesla's first-generation Autopilot still includes a long list   of driver-assist features that Autopilot 2.0 doesn't have yet,   including parking assist, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot   detection, auto-steer, auto-park, summoning, side-collision   warning, and more.Earlier this month, Musk said the ""Tesla software team is   working seven days a week to complete testing and validation"" and   that the team was ""[g]etting close.""Tesla's advantageHow Tesla goes about validating a totally new set of sensors   using a new computing system will make an intriguing story. If   the company really can begin catching up its new sensor suite   starting in December, it would highlight Tesla's ability to   quickly generate and organize significant real-world data and   rapidly deploy improvements to its fleet.A new Autopilot sensor in the side pillar of one of Tesla's   vehicles. Image source: Tesla Motors.When Tesla began shipping its vehicles with its   first-generation Autopilot sensors in 2014, it took a full year   before the company was ready to beam an over-the-air software   update to its fleet for automatic steering. Bringing significant   features to Autopilot 2.0 this quickly, therefore, would put the   spotlight on the company's growing prowess in generating useful   data from its sensors, and deploying software updates to take   advantage of them.While Musk's reference to needing ""a lot of road time"" is   vague, the CEO's previous promise to start catching up Autopilot   2.0 to 1.0 in December implies he doesn't expect it to take much   longer. With fourth-quarter deliveries -- all of which include   new Autopilot sensors -- expected to be up about 44% year over   year (and equal to about half of the company's total deliveries   last year), Tesla's higher sales volume undoubtedly helps by   giving the company more vehicles to collect data from. But the   company's growing experience in organizing vehicle data, and   Autopilot 2.0's more powerful computer and software, are likely   also key catalysts in helping Tesla refine the system.Over time, Tesla expects its Autopilot 2.0 capabilities to far   exceed Autopilot 1.0. Tesla says the updated cars have all the   sensors they need to totally drive themselves in the future. Of   course, to get to this point Tesla will need to continue to   validate and refine the system. In addition, Tesla will   need to obtain regulatory approval to enable its cars to   drive themselves.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons NVIDIA Corporation Stock Could Rise;12/22/2016;"NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA)  has made some impressive moves in 2016 that   have won the company a lot of analyst attention and upgrades --   and rightfully so. The company's ability to challenge industry   giants to grow in many of the most exciting and potentially   high-growth sectors in the tech market could lead to much more   growth in the future. Here are three ways NVIDIA stock could   continue rising.Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();1. More big partnership announcementsNVIDIA has its hands in a lot of segments, but it still gets   most of its revenue from GPUs (graphic processing units). NVIDIA   announced this year that it will be the chip provider forMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) new Surface Studio. This high-end and high-power   computer is undoubtedly going to be one of the industry   news-makers when it's available broadly starting in early   2017.Another exciting partnership announcement this year for NVIDIA   was thatTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) said in late October that it had ended its   relationship withMobileye, and would be switching to NVIDIA's technology instead.   NVIDIA's automated driving technology is quickly becoming   one of the industry standards, and NVIDIA has now signed deals   with various car companies to get its infotainment and driverless   technology in new generations of connected cars. More big   partnerships like these in 2017 are likely to also send the stock   higher.NVIDIA technology in a MINI Cooper. Image source: NVIDIA.2. VR adoptionOther than autonomous cars, virtual reality (VR) has been a   hot topic in the tech industry in 2016. Its potential uses   in personal media, video games, and even video conferencing   for business meetings has led analysts atDigi-Capitalto predict that the industry could be worth $120 billion by   2020.That would be great news for NVIDIA, which is already one of   the most important names in the space for providing high-power   graphics chips for computers, and especially laptops, to make   them VR-ready. Earlier this year, only a small fraction of   laptops had VR capabilities, but NVIDIA is quickly changing that   by rolling out graphics processors for laptops that are closing   the gap with desktops -- a good sign for gaming and VR adoption.   To speed things up, NVIDIA recently started offering a bundle of   free VR games when users buy NVIDIA graphics hardware. Getting   some good numbers on how much this VR trend is adopted in 2017   should provide analysts reason to upgrade this portion of   NVIDIA's business.3. Another earnings beatIn NVIDIA's most recent quarter, the company posted earnings   per share of $0.83, far ahead of analyst expectations, that sent   the stock surging. This is nothing new for this high-performing   company that consistently beats on earnings and gets a share   price bump each time.NVDAdata byYCharts.It will get harder and harder for the company to keep making   these kinds of earnings beats since analysts will start to   consider so much growth the norm for NVIDIA and begin increasing   their forecasts for the next quarter. Already, Q4 estimates are   high, but if history is any indication, NVIDIA could very well   beat those again, which would likely send the stock higher.Should you wait for a pullback in 2017?NVIDIA has had an incredible 2016, both in terms of smart   moves made by the company, and also by share price growth, which   is up 220% so far in 2016. NVIDIA stock now trades at 67   times earnings, and it has quickly become one of the most   expensive companies in its sector. As we've seen time and time   again, that could mean a slight pullback in the year ahead at the   first sign of growth slowing as the company matures.Still, if you want to buy in but are waiting for a pullback,   consider that shares are trading at just 39 times next   year's earnings estimates because of how quickly earnings are   expected to keep growing, meaning if the company performs on the   bottom line throughout 2017, it could gain substantially before   any pullback. Therefore, it's probably better to take the long   approach with this company and invest for where it might grow to   in the next five or 10 years.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Let Everyone Else Worry About Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock;12/22/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIt's no secret that I am not a fan ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). I like the cars, but not the stock. I think that Wall Street   has priced in several perfect scenarios. I am not one to bet on   pure ""hopium"" and risk money with aspirations that all goes   well.Click to EnlargeLuckily, the options market makes it possible to trade TSLA   without betting the farm one way or the other. As opposed to   risking my money at current prices, I can structure options   trades with room for error.makeArticleAd();I have good results trading TSLA using ranges. Whenever   possible, I sell risk against those ranges. So in essence, I sell   lottery tickets to other hopeful traders. I do my homework and   set the trades outside of the ranges then let time do the trick.   When selling spreads, theta is my friend.3 Stocks That Could Get Pounded by Tax Loss       SellingSince I don't want to reinvent the wheel, today I will reset   the same trade that paid me last time. I collected about 80 cents   per contract for selling a TSLA iron condor. The trade was a   complete win without any trouble.The Trade:Sell the TSLA March $160/$155 credit put spread. This is a   bullish trade for which I collect 55 cents per contract. If   successful, this trade yields 12% on money risked. The 20% price   buffer gives this trade a 90% theoretical chance of success.Usually I like to hedge my trades. In this case I want to find   an opposing bearish trade to balance my TSLA portfolio.The Hedge (Optional):Sell the TSLA March $255/$260 credit call spread. This is a   bearish trade for which I collect 45 cents per contract. To win,   I need TSLA stock to stay below the spread. With the current   price buffer, I have a 90% theoretical chance of succeeding. The   potential yield on this side alone is 9% on money risked.Taking both trades leaves me short an iron condor. This is a   range-bound trade where I need TSLA stock to stay between both   spreads sold through expiration. If successful, the overall yield   of the iron condor jumps to over 20% on money risked. Why?   Because I can only lose on one side or the other. The drawback of   having both sides is that I would risk loss in either   direction.3 Big ""Moat"" Stocks Paying Investors 5% (TUP,       IRM, VTR)The Twist:The March contract would include a TSLA earnings report. For some   people this is a scary proposition. So I can set a similar trade,   but for the Jan. 27 contract. The buffer from current price would   need to tighten but would still be viable. An example would be   TSLA Jan. 27 iron condor. I sell a $180/$175 credit put spread   opposed a $235/$240  credit call spread. I collect a net   premium of about 90 cents per contract.I am not required to hold these trades through expiration.

Even Ford Motor Co.Frevealed plans to pause production in Venezuela.Additionally, Honda Motor Co., Ltd.HMCannounced that it is in discussion with Waymo for a self-driving collaboration.Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories1. Winnebago reported adjusted earnings of 60 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Nov 26, 2016), higher than 32 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. Revenues for the first quarter increased 14.5% to $245.3 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $221 million. The year-over-year increase in top line was due to strong growth in the towables business.Winnebago currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2. Toyota expects global sales to increase by 1% to 10.2 million vehicles in 2017 over its projection for 2016, triggered by higher sales in North America, China, Europe and Asia. Launch of new models, including the C-HR compact sport utility vehicle, will drive sales for the automaker. These benefits will offset sluggish demand in the Middle East due to lowoil prices(read more:Toyota Projects Global Sales Increase of 1% for 2017).Currently, Toyota has a Zacks Rank #3.3.General Motors announced plans to invest around $552 million in the U.S.mainly for upgrading manufacturing facilities in Tonawanda, Lockport and Rochester located in New York and Parma Metal center in Ohio.

This Deal Is Another Reason to Take Lucid Motors Seriously;12/21/2016;"Silicon Valley electric-car start-up Lucid Motors said it has   entered a ""strategic supply agreement"" with South Korean giantLG Chem(NASDAQOTH: LGCLF) for lithium-ion battery cells for Lucid's   upcoming electric luxury sedan, the Air.The news was something of a surprise, as it follows an   announcement earlier this month of a similar deal between Lucid   and LG Chem's huge rival, the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). But if anything, it's one more reason   investors interested in electric cars should be watching Lucid's   effort closely.makeArticleAd();Lucid Motors hopes to begin production of its first car, the   Air luxury sedan, by the end of 2018. Image source: Lucid   Motors.What Lucid said about the LG Chem dealIn a statement, Lucid said the new agreement ""establishes LG   Chem asone ofthe key suppliers of cells for Lucid's products"" (emphasis   added). The cylindrical battery cells LG Chem will produce for   Lucid use a ""proprietary chemistry"" developed jointly by the two   companies.Lucid's statement directly acknowledged the existing   relationship with Samsung SDI:Lucid has recently announced a separate battery cell supply     agreement with Samsung SDI. Although both supply agreements are     intended for Lucid's first vehicle, there are other possible     applications for these cells. These could include batteries     developed for other companies as part of Lucid's powertrain     supply business, or variants of the sedan with specific     performance requirements. The differing performance attributes     available from the two cell suppliers provide Lucid with     maximum flexibility to select the best cell for each     application.Lucid has very high expectations for the cells that are used     in our batteries, and we are fortunate to have two companies     that are willing and able to work with us to meet our     requirements.So, what's going on here?Two deals with two heavyweight rivalsIn one sense, it's not surprising that Lucid would seek a deal   with LG Chem, which is already an established player in the   still-new market for lithium-ion cells for automotive   applications. Most notably, it supplies the cells (and some other   parts) forGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM)Chevrolet Bolt EV, and it has been aggressively building production capacity and   seeking other clients around the world. (The Bolt's cells use a   different proprietary chemistry owned by GM.)Of course, we could make a similar case for Samsung SDI.   Samsung, which has made lithium-ion cells for consumer   applications for years, ramped up its electric-car efforts when   it acquired an automotive battery-pack business fromMagna Internationalin 2015. That was one of several moves it has made over the last   couple of years in an effort to build a sizable business as atop-tier auto-industry supplier. Samsung SDI now supplies batteries forBMW's""i"" vehicles andFiat Chrysler Automobiles' electric Fiat 500e.Simply put, both Korean companies are established heavyweights   jockeying for position as electric vehicles become more   commonplace. Meanwhile, aside from a few hand-built prototypes,   Lucid has yet to build a single car -- but it has managed to get   deals with both to supply batteries for its future products.How did Lucid do that? And why?The answer to the ""how"" may be found in Lucid's history. The   company now known as Lucid Motors was originally called Atieva,   and it was originally founded in 2007 to develop advanced battery   packs for electric vehicles. In its initial incarnation, Ateiva   reportedly did electric-vehicle design and engineering work for   GM,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andAudi, and it also did some work on battery packs for electric buses   in China.Ateiva's direction changed in 2014 after a big fundraising   round intended to jump-start its development of a line of   electric cars (and its name changed in October). But the company   retains deep expertise in batteries and battery packs for   electric cars -- and possibly, as its statement about the LG Chem   deal hints, for other applications as well. That's probably why   both Samsung SDI and LG Chem were willing to make deals.As for why, Lucid hasn't quite spelled it out. But there are   many Tesla veterans on Lucid's team (including CTO Peter   Rawlinson, who was the chief engineer on Tesla's groundbreaking   Model S). The company often seems determined to out-do its larger   electric-car rival -- or at least to make a point of showing that   it has learned from Tesla's mistakes.In this case, it's worth noting that Tesla has a deep   relationship with one primary battery supplier (Panasonic). Lucid may feel that Tesla's dependency on a single battery   supplier exposes it to some risk that could be hedged by having   strong relationships with two big suppliers.More evidence that Lucid is for realThe deal with LG Chem is another sign that Lucid is a serious   effort worth watching closely. Lucid is planning to break ground   on its new factory in Arizona sometime in the second quarter of   2017, and it's hoping to begin shipping its first model (the Air   sedan) by the end of 2018.Those dates may slip. However, my sense is that Lucid and its   car are for real, and it looks like a couple of very big   suppliers agree.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Catalysts for Tesla Motors, Inc.'s Vehicle Deliveries This Quarter;12/21/2016;"As far as deliveries go, electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) crushed it last quarter. Deliveries were up 114%   year over year and 72% sequentially. But despite the recent rapid   growth, Tesla's guidance for the final quarter of the year   suggested management only anticipated a modest hike in unit   sales. The company said it expects deliveries to be just over   25,000 units, or only a few hundred units higher than in its   third quarter. Could this guidance be overly conservative?Model X production at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California.   Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();There are three catalysts for continued growth in Tesla's   deliveries that could boost deliveries higher than management   forecast.1. Self-driving hardwareJust one week before Tesla posted its third-quarter results   and shared guidance for its fourth quarter, the company   surprisingly announced it had begunshipping every vehicle with sensors for fully   autonomous driving.While software updates enabling these new vehicles to start   driving themselves could be years away in many of Tesla's   markets, as the company refines the system and waits for   regulatory approval, the significance of this update shouldn't be   overlooked. The new sensor suite includes 360-degree visibility   around the car up to 250 meters, 12 improved ultrasonic sensors   to supplement its cameras, and forward-facing radar. And these   sensors are powered by a new onboard computer with over 40 times   the computing power of the previous-generation processor in Tesla   vehicles.Fortunately, Tesla isn't making buyers wait until the   self-driving update is ready to begin letting customers benefit   from these sensors. Customers who buy these vehicles with the   updated sensor suite can purchase what Tesla calls its ""Enhanced   Autopilot,"" or essentially an improved version of its existing   driver-assist Autopilot system. Tesla plans to begin rolling out   its software updates for its enhanced autopilot as soon as the   company has enough data from updated vehicles on the road to   calibrate the new sensor suite.Throughout the quarter, Tesla has been prominently marketing   the inclusion of self-driving sensors in every vehicle by   highlighting the feature on its homepage and linking to a video   showing the feature in action.2. Model S and X updatesDuring the fourth quarter, Tesla also announced a few notable   upgrades to its Model S and Model X.The Model X (left) and Model S. Image source: The Motley   Fool.For its Model S, Tesla added an option for an all-glass roof.   The new upgrade option no longer includes a center crossbar,   creating a long seamless piece of glass across the top of the   vehicle.And Tesla's new Model X option is perhaps even more notable.   The company finally began offering a seating option with a   foldable second row. The feature helps create 88 cubic feet of   interior cargo space, giving the SUV the greatest interior   storage capacity of its class, according to Tesla. Not having an   option for foldable second-row seats was one of the biggest   complaints about the Model X.These updates were announced in the beginning of November,   leaving enough time for customers to place orders for vehicles   with these new options and still take delivery before the fourth   quarter ends.3. Increasing productionFinally, rising production during Tesla's fourth quarter   should make it easier for the company to deliver more vehicles   than its guidance for ""just over 25,000 units"" calls for. Barring   any unexpected bottlenecks in Tesla's factory, it's likely the   company continued to increase production during the final quarter   of the year.Tesla factory. Image source: The Motley Fool.In Tesla's third-quarter shareholder letter, management   specifically noted it was still ramping up production of its   Model X. While Tesla management has repeatedly emphasized how   difficult it is to predict the SUV's production ramp-up, it has   certainly been very rapid recently. Thanks to rising production   of the vehicle, third-quarter Model X deliveries jumped 89%   sequentially. While Tesla's conservative guidance for total   vehicle deliveries obviously suggests investors shouldn't expect   such a sharp increase in Model X deliveries in Q4, it's unlikely   the continued production ramp-up for Model X won't lead to at   least slightly higher deliveries during the quarter.These three catalysts combined should make it fairly easy for   Tesla to beat its own guidance for vehicle deliveries in the   final quarter of the year. The company has beat its quarterly   guidance for vehicle deliveries in 11 of the past 14 quarters,   but has missed its guidance twice this year. Tesla announces   vehicle deliveries within three days of each quarter's end, so   investors can expect an update on the key metric during the first   three days of January.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here’s Why Tesla Has A Competitive Edge In The Autonomous Cars Market;12/21/2016;"Several automakers and other companies have been working on autonomous cars, which are being touted as the vehicle of the future. Yet another,  Tesla Motors (TSLA), has established a clear lead. The company has installedautopilot hardwarein every vehicle produced since October 2014. These vehicles have now generated nearly 1.3 billion miles of data, which can be used to improve intelligence for a fully autonomous vehicle. This gives Tesla a huge competitive advantage over other players.  These include Google, whose parent company Alphabet recently spun off the autonomous car business intoa separate company.  Also present are General Motors and Uber, which do not have access to any such large volumes of ""real"" data.  Autonomous autos developed by Google have covered around2 millionreal miles, significantly lower than Tesla's data. We believe that, as consumers start thinking of transport as a service instead of a private vehicle, the self-driving market will grow significantly. The number of private owned cars per capita is declining in cities, where there is often excellent public transportation and millennials do not prefer to own cars. In the long run, self-driving cars could augment or even replace the existing public transport infrastructure and we expect this to be a huge opportunity for automakers. (Read Self Driving Cars, Part 2 : Size Of Opportunity Involved).See our full analysis for Tesla MotorsModel 3 Likely To Have Hardware Enabling Full   Self-DrivingmakeArticleAd();Tesla's much awaited Model 3, which is likely to be on the roads by the end of 2017, will have an improved hardware suite that will enable fully autonomous driving. If this launch date is met with the promised features, Tesla will be the first company to release a fully autonomous car in the market. While other companies might not be far behind in launching similar vehicles, the installation of this hardware will ensure that Tesla can collect more data as this model launches, further improving its autonomous driving intelligence.Model 3 is Tesla's mass market electric vehicle and it received an overwhelming response when bookings were opened earlier this year.  According to our estimates, after its launch in 2017, Model 3's market share will climb significantly reaching nearly 20% by the end of our forecast period.A first mover's advantage in the autonomous cars market comes with a huge advantage of accumulating enormous amounts of data, which is the backbone of artificial intelligence. Tesla already had this advantage and is likely to gain more once Model 3 is launched. With self-driving cars likely to be the future of the automotive industry, Tesla will have an edge over other players in this technology.Understand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock   Price at TrefisView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Rallies on HUGE Upside Potential;12/21/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's been a roller coaster experience withTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) since its IPO in late June. Within its first three months as a publicly traded company, TWLO stock rose by over 137%, before getting dealt a huge blow in October. Since then, TWLO has lost roughly 53%.Source:Web Summit Via FlickrAs of Dec. 19, TWLO stock had lost roughly 8.5% in December alone. However, the stock price decline improved to just under a 5% loss by Dec. 21.makeArticleAd();The gain here came after Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White initiated coverage on TWLO stock, tagging it a ""buy"" with a $45 a share price target. That's over 30% upside potential.TWLO Stock Valuation ProblemThe truth is that TWLO stock looks overvalued, going by its financials. That's a big reason it's struggled during its first few months in the market.The 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to OwnTWLO currently makes no profit. It recorded a loss of about $35.5 million in 2015. In 2014, Twilio stock grew its top line by roughly 78%. In 2015, top line growth came in at roughly 88%. However, the company expects only 61% revenue growth this year. That's worrying because the company is nowherenearthe point where growth should be slowing down.On top of that, TWLO stock currently sports a price-sales ratio of just under 11. A company with similar growth rate,58.com Inc (ADR)(NYSE:WUBA) has a P/S ratio of four and expects to report 60% revenue increase this year. It gets even worse for TWLO on considering that WUBA is expected to report such revenue growth, having grown its top line from just over $87 million in 2012 to roughly $715 million in 2015.Still, valuation isn't everything for companies in early growth stage. If not,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) would probably never have been a good buy.TSLA sported a P/S ratio of about 25 in 2012. That has improved to just over five as of this writing. The growth potential is usually what matters when looking at early growth companies like TWLO stock.Analyst's Case for TWLO StockMoreover, analyst White believes all isn't lost for TWLO in terms of valuation. In his research noteobtainedbyStreet Insider, he said:""Currently, Twilio trades at an EV/revenue ratio of 6.3x our CY:17 sales forecast and well below the 9-22x EV/ NTM ratios (up to three years after an IPO) of high growth companies (seventeen companies we analyzed) of the past. Given the sharp decline in Twilio's stock since September (down 59%), we believe the market has already discounted the lock-up expiration that begins this week""The translation of this is that, the entirety of Twilio Inc is valued fairly relative to its revenue, compared to other 17 high growth companies that Drexel Hamilton has analyzed. Another version is that, at current levels, the company's revenue should be very attractive to potential acquirers.White also made mention of a first mover advantage in the cloud communications platform market. This market is worth over $45 billion, according to estimates from IDC. Interestingly, based on Drexel Hamilton's 2017 revenue forecast, TWLO stock owns less than a percent of the market. Even at this, it's still the biggest player in the cloud communications industry.TWLO has been taking steps to grab more of this market. In the third quarter, it introduced the Twilio Enterprise Plan, which is designed to offer advanced security and access management for bigger organizations. It has also unveiled Voice Insights, which gives developers deeper analytics of the users of their voice applications.Bottom line on TWLO StockAs stated above, most of the valuation metrics you'd want to look at would tell you that TWLO stock is overvalued.Alibaba (BABA) Stock Has a Thorn in Its Side -     Donald TrumpHowever, it's still an early growth company with a disruptive concept. Innovative companies likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), UberandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are using Twilio.TWLO is definitely worth a watch especially if you're looking to invest in a disruptive company.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for     2017The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks of 2016The postTwilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Rallies on HUGE Upside Potentialappeared first onInvestorPlace."

What Business Model Will Succeed in Energy Storage?;12/21/2016;"As the cost of batteries, fuel cells, and renewable energy   more broadly come down, it's becoming clear that energy storage   will be a big business in the future. It can smooth out the   variability inherent with wind and solar, provide valuable   services to the grid, and move cheap renewable energy created   during the day to hours when it's most needed.It's becoming more clear that energy storage will be valuable,   like wind and solar energy a decade ago. What's not yet clear,   though, is the answer as tohowenergy storage will generate value for investors. Creating a   business model that can exploit the advantages of energy storage   to make money will be key. And the industry may be perilous for   those on the bleeding edge.makeArticleAd();Powerwall 2 on the outside of a home. Image source: Tesla.Where energy storage has valueGenerally, we know where energy storage has value. Rocky   Mountain Institute has defined 13 value drivers from energy   storage, including self consumption of solar, backup power, and   energy arbitrage (lowering electricity consumption during high   cost times and moving it to low cost times). These are the itemsTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) , andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) have used to justify a lot of the limited amount   of energy storage that's been installed today, but those   businesses are essentially in pilot mode.Image source: Rocky Mountain Institute'sThe Economics of Battery Energy Storage.If the chart above is correct, the bigger sources of value may   come from the utility side of the ledger. Transmission congestion   relief and distribution investment deferral are two of the most   valuable uses of energy storage, but they're driven by utility   needs and go through regulators. For developers, you can't just   build a battery and bid it into the open market without   regulators driving the utility to buy services from you.There's value from energy storage for the entire grid, from   utility to customer, that much is clear. The question is, who   pays for this value and how? Here's a few viable options.Value to the home and businessesLooking at energy storage from the customer side, the   justification will be all about cost reductions. For homeowners,   that may be energy arbitrage in states like Hawaii and now   California. Commercial customers can justify energy storage   through reducing demand charges, a fee the utility charges based   on peak demand even if it's only for 15 minutes per month. These   are both ways to lower payments to the utility, which has caused   utilities across the country to change rate structures to stem   the loss of customer electricity demand.A potential way forward would be utilities finding a way to   build rate structures that allow customers to install solar and   energy storage on site, but still incorporate into the grid. This   would keep people tied to the grid and create a win-win   situation. But finding a solution that works for everyone won't   be easy.Utilities see energy storage differentlyTo understand how a utility sees energy storage you have to go   back to a utility's business model. A utility's incentive is to   grow electricity consumption and increase their asset base from   which to charge customers. That means they have incentive to keep   customers from owning energy storage and would rather own storage   assets themselves.The problem for utilities is if they push back too hard   against customers owning energy storage, the more they'll push   companies to develop business models to make energy storage   economical. This could even push residential customers to   eventually leave the grid and commercial customers to find   alternatives to buying electricity from the traditional utility,   something that's already taking place in Nevada. So, utilities   will want to create rate structures that allow them to partner   with renewables, energy storage, and customers. This may be   easier said than done and there's no easy answer to how utilities   should react to energy storage.Powerwall 2. Image source: Tesla.Solar + storage may have a bright futureWhen you look at the dynamics, you can see that there are a   lot of complex incentives clashing in energy storage. But one   area where the technology can bring value is when combined with   intermittent renewable energy. This could take hold in   distributed resources or at the power plant level.One idea being pushed by solar installers is for small energy   storage systems in a home or business, known as a distributed   energy storage asset, be compensated to balance the grid on a   localized level. They could store energy when it's cheap and   allow the grid to draw energy when demand is high. Hundreds or   thousands of distributed assets could be tied together to create   a network of assets with the grid providing a price signal and a   third party -- like Tesla, SunPower, or Sunrun -- reacting to   maximize the value of their distributed assets.On the utility side, we could see solar or wind projects bid   energy projects into the grid but provide attached energy   storage. This could reduce the volatility going to the grid,   reducing the need for spinning reserves, and can ease the effects   ofthe duck curve(a spike in demand in the late afternoon when the sun goes down   and people get home from work). If long duration energy storage   technology improves enough we may even see solar projects save   energy for nighttime. That would truly be a game changer.Who will get energy storage right?You can see that creating a business model to take advantage   of energy storage will be difficult. But there are a few things   we can deduce from the state of the industry and the history of   adjacent technologies like solar panels.The first thing is that battery manufacturers and companies   that don't have a discernible technology advantage won't likely   generate much value for investors. Batteries are a commodity and   have been low margin for decades. That's why nearly every company   -- with the exception of Tesla -- has decided to focus onhowto use the battery and not manufacturing of batteries. The same   goes for other energy storage technologies.Utilities will also have a hard time generating a significant   amount of value from energy storage. In some cases, they may be   able to install storage to offset other investments, but that   will mean a smaller asset base to rate base, which hurts the   business long term. There's just no clear model for utilities in   energy storage outside of getting regulators to allow them to own   distributed battery systems in homes and businesses and, like   rooftop solar, that will be a tough sell.That leaves developers buying commodity energy storage   products and selling services to the grid or customers. This is   where I think the true financial opportunity lies. It could take   the form of residential solar companies up-selling storage and   then controlling its functions to maximize value, making money   through a fee or revenue-sharing model with customers. This may   involve aggregating thousands of energy storage systems and sell   the resources into the grid, something an aggregator could do but   a homeowner or single business couldn't. Or the solution may be   as simple as software to tie a battery to the utility's price   signals and then sharing the revenue with a battery owner.I think the business model to watch will be adding energy   storage to another energy service like solar. Solar + storage   could be a compelling proposition and would be an easier sell   than energy storage as a stand-alone service. But that's my best   estimation of what will happen in the future. And like solar a   decade ago, the companies that can build a viable business model   in energy storage have a big market opportunity ahead of   them.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Things You Should Know About the Solar Sector;12/21/2016;"The solar sector can be an enticing and risky space for   investors. There's tremendous growth in the industry andtrillions of dollars in potential revenue, but companies come and go rapidly as the landscape changes.   Before jumping in, here are three things every investor should   keep in mind.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Understand the importance of external policiesSean Williams: One of the most important things to know about solar stocks is   that external policies can have a big impact on the industry.   Three really good examples are OPEC's policies, the EPA's   policies, and U.S. Solar Investment Tax Credit.Solar panel makers thrive when there's both demand and urgency   for their products. This means when fossil fuel prices are high,   the urgency for consumers and businesses to switch to solar is   there. When crude andnatural   gas pricesfall, solar panel supply can increase and the urgency to make the   transition to a green energy solution decreases. Over the past   two-plus years, we've witnessed solar panel supply increase and   urgency decline as crude and natural gas have hit multi-year   lows. However, with OPEC recently agreeing to cut production and   crude prices surging on the news, it's possible we could see   demand for solar begin creeping back into the industry.Within the U.S., policies from the Environmental Protection   Agency can certainly have an impact on the solar industry.   Tougher carbon emission regulations have encouraged utilities to   switch away from coal-fired electrical generation and toward   alternatives, such as cleaner-burning natural gas and   solar-powered systems. Of course, president-elect Donald Trump's   stance that some EPA regulations and oversight should be pulled   back could work against the solar industry in the near-term.Finally, we have the U.S Solar Investment Tax Credit (SITC),   which allows for a 30% dollar-for-dollar tax credit on the cost   of the panels and installation. In late 2015, the SITC was   extended through 2019, providing an impetus for Americans to   invest in home-solar systems. The SITC will begin throttling down   in 2020 before disappearing completely for consumers by 2023.   These subsidies can be a strong tool that encourage or discourage   solar investment.As a solar industry investor you'll need to keep your eyes on   the policies and subsidies that could impact the valuation of the   companies you own.Solar is a big growth industry, but also very cyclicalJasonHall: Today, solar still generates a very small percentage of total   electricity around the world, meaning there's likely to be huge   growth for decades to come. Factor in an expected   one-billion-person expansion of the power-hungry global middle   class over the next couple of decades, and there's a wonderful   growth market for long-term investors to profit from. One has to   look only at power generation in the United States alone to see   the potential:US Primary Energy Productiondata byYCharts.However, investors must also understand the nature of the   solar industry's likely growth to have the best chance at   profiting. The best way to understand solar panel manufacturing   is that it's a wonderful long-term growth industry, but it will   also be highly cyclical from year to year, with ups-and-downs in   the short-term even as long-term demand increases. This is   particularly true in the utility and commercial/industrial   segments, where the amount spent on large, expensive projects can   shift dramatically up or down from year to year.At the same time, solar panel manufacturing is complex,   expensive, and largely a cost-driven, commodity business. This   makes operating leverage critically important, and any solar   manufacturer that's unable to respond to shifts in demand before   the market shifts can swing from solid profits to steep losses   very quickly.For this reason, investors must understand that:These cycles are inevitable.It can take time for even the best manufacturers to work     through those cycles.It can take time for investments to pan out, requiring     discipline and patience, as well as knowledge of which     manufacturers have strong operations and balance sheet     stability.Solar has a lot of potential, both as an energy source and an   investment. But unless you're willing to put in the work and   understand the industry and find the best companies, it's also an   easy industry to lose a lot of money in.Flexibility is a mustTravis Hoium: Sean is right that policies impact the solar industry's demand   more than most industries. And if we want to go more granular we   could look at how policies in states like Hawaii, Nevada, and   California are impacting the industry on a local level.That's why having a flexible business model is really key to   solar companies. Manufacturers need to be able to move supply to   where it's needed all around the globe, installers need to be   able to ramp up and down depending on demand, and finance   companies need to be flexible in the products they offer.One example of a company handling this well isSunPower Corp(NASDAQ: SPWR) , the high efficiency solar panel manufacturer.   The company sells solar panels into nearly every major solar   market, so when Germany was a big installer it had a presence   there and now that China is growing it has solutions there.   SunPower can also go big or small, providing solutions for   rooftop solar customers and utilities looking for massive power   plants. This doesn't guarantee success, but it allows a   flexibility to change the business as market conditions   necessitate.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) subsidiary SolarCity has been on the opposite end   of the spectrum. The company is almost completely focused in the   U.S. and has tied itself to the lease/power purchase agreement   finance model. When states like Nevada change policy the company   has to lay off workers and shut down operations. And when   customers started demanding loans this year the company had   trouble adapting, leading to multiple reductions in guidance.The solar industry changes extremely quickly and that requires   flexibility to survive. And some companies are set up to adapt   much more quickly than others.10 stocks we like better than SunPowerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Wins 1, Loses 1;12/20/2016;"Electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) reportedly made some important progress on   expanding its executive team recently when it hired Volvo's Head   of Interior Engineering. But Tesla also lost a tenured executive   from the company's energy storage business. The two executive   changes, detailed byElectrekon Monday, highlight pressures at the company as Tesla ramps up   for its critical Model 3 launch next year.Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Another hire aimed at boosting qualityIt's no secret Tesla has experienced some quality issues.   While the reliability score for the Model S was recently ranked   as average byConsumer Reports, the same product rating agency said the newer Model X has been   plagued with problems. Going further, Tesla cited Model X quality   issues as one of the reasons for the company's   slower-than-expected production ramp-up earlier this year.Tesla has taken a number of actions to address production   quality, including making important hires to help with production   and quality control. Some of the notable hires that Tesla made   during 2016 which aimed at increasing Tesla's expertise in   manufacturing and production quality includeVolkswagen'sPeter Hochholdinger, who was responsible for production of Audi's A4, A5, and Q5   vehicles, andApple's Director of Reliability Engineering.And now Tesla seems to be making another hire that might help   bolster product quality. Volvo's Head of Interior Engineering,   Anders Bell, will join the electric-car maker ""in an equivalent   role this month,"" said Electrek's Fred Lambert.On Bell's LinkedIn profile, he lists key accomplishments in   his most recent role at Volvo of launching the interiors for the   Volvo XC90, X90, and V90.While it's possible Bell will help improve the interiors of   the Model S and the Model X, it's likely Tesla's upcoming Model   3, which management plans to launch before the end of 2017, will   be Bell's biggest priority when he comes on board.It's time for a breakOn another note, Tesla is simultaneously losing key talent.   The VP of its energy storage business, Mateo Jaramillo, is   leaving the company after working there for seven years.   Jaramillo's reason for leaving? The executive is ready for a   break from the high-pressure Tesla culture, Electrek gathers.Tesla Model X production in the company's car factory. Image   source: The Motley Fool.Both Bell's onboarding and Jaramillo's decision to exit put   the spotlight on changes at Tesla as the company begins preparing   to dramatically increase production. With its sights set on   increasing vehicle production from an annualized run-rate of   100,000 units today to 500,000 units in 2018 on the back of Model   3's higher-volume deliveries, Tesla is in the middle of a major   expansion. In Nevada, Tesla is rapidlybuilding its Gigafactorywhile simultaneously increasing battery production in the   portions of the building that are already up. And in California,   Tesla recently unveiled plans tonearly double the size of its car factory. Meanwhile, production and deliveries of the company's Models S   and X are soaring. In Tesla's most recent quarter, deliveries   were up 114% year over year and 72% sequentially.Investors may want to keep an eye on Tesla's executive comings   and goings. While there have been a few prominent executive   departures at the company during the past year, it has   undoubtedly benefited froma strong inflow of integral talent. Of course, this should be expected in light of Tesla's   ambitious growth plans, but it's still comforting to see that   Tesla is able to attract experienced and accomplished names like   Bell.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Ahead of Model 3, Tesla Motors, Inc. Continues to Revamp Its Supercharger Program;12/19/2016;"One of the key selling points toTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) all-electric vehicles is the company's expansive   Supercharger network. This robust network's 120 kilowatt-powered   charging stations makes long-distance travel feasible in the   U.S., Western Europe, China, Japan, and part of Australia -- and   Tesla continues to add new markets. But the network is set to be   tested when the electric-car maker brings to market its $35,000   Model 3 next year.Tesla Supercharger. Image source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();Ahead of Model 3's launch, and in anticipation of higher   demand for the charging locations, Tesla is making lots of   changes its Supercharger program.Supercharger idling feesThanks to the Model 3's lower price point compared with   Tesla's Model S and X vehicles, Tesla expects that the Model 3   will help take annual production from a run rate of 100,000 units   today to 500,000 in 2018. With five times as many cars on the   road, Tesla needs to ensure the stations don't become congested   -- a problem Tesla has already been dealing with in markets where   electric vehicles are popular -- namely, California and   Norway.But the automaker announced a solution on Friday it thinks   will increase Supercharger availability and ""make the   Supercharging experience far better for everyone."" To address   Supercharger congestion, completely charged vehicles still   sitting at a Supercharger location will now incur a fee.Tesla explained the move in its blog post:The Tesla app allows owners to remotely monitor their     vehicle, alerting them when their charge is nearly complete and     again once fully charged. For every additional minute a car     remains connected to the Supercharger, it will incur a $0.40     idle fee. If the car is moved within 5 minutes, the fee is     waived. To be clear, this change is purely about increasing     customer happiness and we hope to never make any money from     it.But there is one exception to this fee, Musk said in a   follow-up tweet after the announcement: ""We are going to modify   this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. If   the site is basically deserted, no problem to park.""Free forever -- but only for someFor now, every Tesla vehicle purchased gets free lifetime   access to Tesla's Supercharger network when traveling long   distance. But, earlier this year, Teslaannouncedthat it will end this benefit for any orders made after Jan.   1.Tesla detailed the change in a blog post:""For Teslas ordered after January 1, 2017, 400 kWh of free   Supercharging credits (roughly 1,000 miles) will be included   annually so that all owners can continue to enjoy free   Supercharging during travel. Beyond that, there will be a small   fee to Supercharge which will be charged incrementally and cost   less than the price of filling up a comparable gas car.""The change, Tesla said, will allow the company to reinvest   into its network, accelerating its growth to improving the   experience for current and future owners. But Tesla was careful   to emphasize that its Supercharger network ""will never be a   profit center for the company.""An expansionModel 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Of course, fees for idle vehicles at Superchargers and the   network's monetization won't be enough to fully alleviate   problems associated with a rapidly growing number of Teslas on   the road as the Model 3 launches at a higher volume. To this end,   the company is also investing in an aggressive expansion of the   network. At Tesla's Model 3 unveiling in March, the company said   it planned to double its Supercharger stations, or individual   charging stalls (not to be confused with Supercharger locations)   around the world by the end of 2017, increasing them from about   3,600 when the Model 3 was unveiled to 7,200. Today, Tesla has   4,875 Superchargers.Tesla's charging network is integral to its customers'   experience of owning a fully electric car. By offeringmuch faster charging than what's available for   other electric cars, Tesla currently is the only manufacturer to make long-distance   travel in a fully electric car feasible. So it's good to see   Tesla taking steps to prepare the way for the Model 3, which   management plans to begin delivering to customers sometime during   the second half of 2017.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of Nov. 7, 2016This podcast was recorded on Dec. 16, 2016.Dylan Lewis:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. It's Friday, December 16th, and we're doing a   roundup of self-driving car updates. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,   and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist,   Daniel Sparks. Daniel, how's it going?Daniel Sparks:Good, Dylan, thanks for having me on the show.Lewis:A little blustery over there in Colorado, huh?Sparks:Yeah, high wind warnings this morning. It's pretty crazy. Glad   you can't hear it through the microphone.Lewis:Yeah, it seems like the kind of weather you might want some   driving assistance, huh?Sparks:I guess so. (laughs)Lewis:So, Daniel, there's been a ton of news regarding   self-driving cars in the past month or so. It seems like   pretty much every major player in the space has come out with   an announcement of some sort. It seems like on our end, we   were probably due to do a little check-in and see what's going   on. How's that sound?Sparks:Sounds good.Lewis:The first news that I really noticed -- I mean, there were other   ones that came up in the past couple weeks, but one that really   caught my attention -- was Alphabet's self-driving car project   doesn't seem to be just a project anymore. It seems like they're   emphasizing this within the Alphabet holding structure.Sparks:Yeah, we saw that blog post, Waymo is what they're calling it.   It'll be interesting to see where they're taking this, for   sure.Lewis:In that blog post, they said ""Waymo stands for a new way forward   in mobility. We're a self-driving technology company with a   mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move   around."" The TLDR here, the very simple explanation of what's   going on is, they are taking the self-driving car project under   Google X and turning it into an identifiable business under   Alphabet. This is awesome, I think, if you're an Alphabet   shareholder, because it shows that they're going to put a little   bit more emphasis on moving things along and not having these fun   projects be just that, that there's going to be a   commercialization element to it, and a path to that. But to me,   more than anything else, this highlights the benefits of the   Alphabet holding company structure, and how under CFO Ruth Porat,   they've decided to take a more Wall Street-friendly look at   some of the things that are going on there at Google.Sparks:Yeah, it definitely highlights the Alphabet structure that   they have set up, and the benefits of it. Investors should   realize that this isn't just some new project that they're   doing. This is the graduation of the self-driving   car project to an actual company. This is really one of the   first instances where we've seen this under the Alphabet   structure, where we can see, where they take this from   their Google X area, which is more just moonshots in   development, is kind of how they're making it look, and   we're really seeing that with this particular instance, and   then graduating over to an actual company and, like you   said, putting some pressure on it so they can start turning   it into a business.Lewis:Yeah, and this is, like you said, not something that   happened overnight. The self-driving car project has been in   the works, I believe, for over eight years at this point. My read   on this -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Daniel   -- is, we're not really going to be seeing actual financials   on Waymo broken out when Alphabet gives its quarterly   numbers, at least not anytime soon. It seems like they will   probably continue to be lumped into other   bets reporting for the foreseeable future.Sparks:Yeah, I definitely think they're going to keep it in other   bets, because with Google's revenue at the $22.2 billion and   the other bets revenue at about $200   million, virtually all of the company's profits coming   from the core Google segments, and nearly a $1 billion loss   coming from other bets -- I don't think Alphabet is ready, just   because Waymo is turning into a company, to   start segmenting out this information on its own. Not only   would it probably draw attention to simply a losing segment,   since they haven't really monetized this service yet,   and like we said, that's kind of the purpose of it. And,   also, it could potentially give competitors an edge that   they don't really need to let competitors have, by looking   into their business. This is very small to their business, they   don't have to report it to investors. It's not material at all,   so they might as well keep it under wraps as long as they   can.Lewis:Yeah. So, while we won't have a ton of financial insights, it   seems, what I think this does open the door to is some   questions and maybe a little bit more pointed commentary   from management in some of those quarterly calls and   maybe some of those press releases on specifically   what's going on with the self-driving car project. Again,   probably not something we're going to get a ton of insight into   immediately, but something that in the coming quarters and years,   we should definitely expect to hear more from.Sparks:Definitely.Lewis:One of the other things we got some color on regarding   Google's self-driving car project, I guess I should be   calling it Waymo now, is exactly how they plan to   monetize self-driving car technology. This is something   that's been kind of up in the air for a while. At times,   they've talked about not wanting to be a car   manufacturer, but it's hard to take them at face value   there, because they're looking to obscure this as much as   possible. You want to talk a little bit about what we got in   terms of commentary there?Sparks:Yeah, that was one of the big takeaways when they were   coming out with this Waymo announcement. There was some   speculation that Alphabet could be working on its own   Google-branded car. While they might not actually have   thought of planning of manufacturing it, as they do   with their hardware products, they often outsource   the manufacturing and then slap that brand on, similar   to the way Appledoes with Foxconn, but, there was some speculation that   they could try to be working on some Google-branded car,   and we have seen their cars with no steering wheel,   their ambitious vision of a totally autonomous driving   experience. There has been some speculation in the past that they   would be planning to bring a larger fleet of those to the market.   But the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik -- I think that's how you   pronounce it?Lewis:I think it's pronounced another way, but I'm not sure. I've   only seen it and writing, I have not heard it said. I   understand how neither of us are totally sure.Sparks:OK, that sounds better, we'll go with that. We'll just call him   John today. John, he emphasized that they're not trying   to turn into a car business, but rather wanting to focus on   the technology behind the cars, and basically, Waymo's mission to   make driving autonomous, to make it safer, and, as in their name,   really focus on the mobility. I think this is a good move.   This is something that Alphabet has succeeded at in the past by   really focusing on software and gathering data -- because,   essentially, that's the company's core mission, to organize data.   So, by doing this, I'm actually more bullish on the segment by   seeing that they're really going to focus on their core   competencies with it. And maybe similar to the way Alphabet tries   to add in Google-branded hardware later on with Android,maybe they'll do a similar things with cars by trying to bring in   Google-branded cars later on after they've really developed and   honed in on their expertise and the autonomous area of the   technology.Lewis:Yeah, the quote from John, as we'll refer to him, ""We're in the   business of making better drivers. We're a self-driving car   company, not a car company."" I think, if you look back at   some of the things that have happened in the last month or   so, you see that Apple seems to be taking kind of a similar   route with their autonomous driving ambitions.Sparks:Right. We see these big tech companies, and then you look at the   giant automobile segments, where companies like Alphabet and   Apple don't have any significant revenue, and in theory, it   looks like this awesome opportunity for Alphabet and Apple to   start making these cars. Maybe that's why a lot of the   speculation received so much attention, thinking about a   Google-branded or Apple-branded car is a really powerful   idea, it could open up the companies to huge new revenue   opportunities. But, when you actually get down to think   about it, especially in Alphabet's case, it would really be   out of their core competency to start making cars. Even   Apple, by outsourcing their manufacturing and building   Apple-branded hardware products, along with their software, cars   is just a whole 'nother breed. It's a really capital-intensive   business. By Alphabet doing this, and now, like we're going to   talk about, Apple focusing on the software part of the   business, it really de-risks these new segments, but on the other   hand, may decrease some of the potential upside if things do   go well.Lewis:Yeah, you look at the margin profile for the car   business and the smartphone business, and they   are dramatically different. It would be very tough to   achieve high-30% margins in cars. For as much as I know   about the industrials business, I know that. So, you can   understand why these huge tech companies are instead   choosing to focus on something that's super scalable and can be   easily brought into millions of cars without actually having   to manufacture them themselves.Sparks:Right.Lewis:And if you had any doubts about Apple's interest in making   self-driving cars, I think Tim Cook has been pretty   coy in some public interviews about not really letting in on   a lot of details, being a little cagey, the company sent a letter   to the National Highway Traffic Safety   Administration regarding Federal Automated Vehicle   Policy earlier this month. And it made it pretty   clear they have something cooking there. The NHTSA can   grant exemptions to certain compliance standards if   that organization decides that it's important for research   and investigations. Apple's letter was essentially   urging the administration to expedite the exemption requests   that are coming in from some new entrants, so, some people   that maybe haven't been quite as ambitious as the early entrants   into autonomous driving. That, I think, says all you   need to hear about their interest in this space, and the   fact that it's something that they're obviously putting a   decent number of resources into.Sparks:Yeah, I think that Apple is definitely working on a   car, as far as we can tell. Recent reports suggest that   the company has hundreds of employees working on it. The   transition, initially, it was referred to as Project Titan, and   it initially transitioned away from building a car   -- this is all speculation, keep in mind -- to really   focusing on the technology, similar to Alphabet. The rumor   is, now, it's going to be deeply integrated into iOS, and   the company is looking for a 2017 deadline of proof of concept of   something that can work. So, Alphabet and Apple, these are   still really speculative things. But, at least with   Alphabet, we're starting to see a direction, an actual company,   and an effort to monetize the business, which is encouraging.Lewis:And for both of those companies, these are things that are   exciting. They're very attractive, they're fun to   speculate on because they are nascent tech. But they are not   going to be meaningful to the top line or bottom line for quite   some time. That's something to keep in mind there. Of course,   flipping over to the private side of things, not a public   company, but Uber also made headlines this week, of   course, not to be outdone by some of the larger tech names.   After the company had deployed some self-driving vehicles in   Pittsburgh in September earlier this year, they now have deployed   about five or so autonomous Volvo XC90 SUVs in San   Francisco. The aim there was to have them not only be out on the   roads, but out on the roads picking up customers, right?Sparks:Right. They kind of jumped the gun on this one, and put them   out on the California roads without a permit,   which California requires for auto   manufacturers testing autonomous vehicles. What Uber did was   kind of make an assumption with wordplay. Apparently the   rule was that manufacturers testing autonomous vehicles that   don't require human drivers to get a permit, and to make   sure that someone is there, ready to grab the wheel and take   over. That wordplay was that the vehicle was autonomous,   that's when they would need a permit. So, Uber argued,   ""Well, these cars aren't technically   autonomous, because we have drivers there ready to take over   when something goes wrong."" Of course, in their blog post, they   did say they're deploying ""self-driving"" cars, they used that   wording. So, it's really interesting to see them going this   route with it. It caused a lot of debate as to whether   this is right. It brought Uber back to a problem they had early   and were scaling back on, which was being a rebel when it comes   to regulations. Kind of putting them back in that spot right   now.Lewis:Yeah, that certainly doesn't help their case in trying   to improve their reputation. I know that's something that has   plagued them for quite some time. It'll be interesting to   see how that plays out with regulators in California, and   whether it's something they push forward on. In preparing for the   show, we talked about how there's kind of a huge difference   between how a public company and a private company might   handle something like this, just because the liability on   Alphabet or Apple's side, with doing something without express   written consent from the regulatory body, could   be devastating to them as a business and to shareholders.   And, I'm sure there are a lot of controls in place for   people that have private placements with Uber. But, you can   afford to be a little bit more brash when you don't have   public investors, I guess.Sparks:Right. And it's worth noting that, according   to Bloomberg, the California DMV is saying it's   going to try to pursue legal action on Uber. I don't think   it's clear yet that Uber has stopped. But there was an   interesting scenario when, on the first day of this program,   one of the Volvos with the self-driving hardware ran a red   light when a pedestrian was trying to cross the sidewalk.   Uber said in an update that it wasn't actually in self-driving   mode when this happened. They emphasized, ""So, this is why we   need to be pushing so hard for a self-driving future to help with   safety."" Kind of a funny instance.Lewis:Maybe more wordplay there, too, it seems. (laughs) And, last   but not least, I know that you wanted to touch on Tesla,   and how they are going about self-driving a little bit   differently, just because they are not, by nature, a   platform company, they are a manufacturer first, and that   gives them some advantages when it comes to integrating   their solutions, and maybe on the data side, as well.Sparks:Yeah. So, you have companies like Tesla, GM, in some ways,   who are trying to work on the self-driving   software, but also on the manufacturing. You look at Uber,   when they're solely focused on the software for now, for   self-driving, it does present some challenges, as far as   testing these autonomous vehicles and getting them ready for the   public roads works, because a company like Uber can't really give   its sensors away to manufacturers. They would actually have to   sell those sensors. And that's where the challenge is. How are   they going to get these sensors over to all   these manufacturers, and how are they going to get all this   data about how these sensors are operating on the   roads, unless they're actually getting the sensors into the   cars? So, then you have companies like Tesla, who   are already delivering vehicles with the self-driving   sensors in them, they could run these sensors in shadow mode   while people are driving in their normal daily routes, even   while they're holding the wheel, and they could collect   information and really start getting the data, because they're   also a manufacturer. Of course, they're still making money   on their sensors, because they're selling the car itself.Then, you have General Motors, similarly, they are a   manufacturer, but they're also working, at least in part,   with Lyft. And they've made some of their   own acquisitions on developing a self-driving software. So,   they can sell their cars, make money on their cars, and   have a revenue stream with a business model already as they're   putting these sensors in vehicles, and start collecting data. Of   course, they are not to the point yet where they are already   delivering cars with self-driving hardware like Tesla is, but I   imagine that they could do that in the future as well, and run it   in shadow mode. That's just an interesting point.Lewis:Yeah. There are a lot of things that are unclear about the   self-driving car market. The one thing that is clear is   that there are a bunch of different companies with a lot of   money at their disposal trying to crack that nut a   couple of different ways.Sparks:Right, yeah. It's a really uncertain space right now. I   think that's the biggest takeaway from this. It's exciting, it's   interesting, but these are all small portions of businesses. Even   at a company like Tesla, there are no cars actually driving   themselves on the road right now. All of these, investors   should put it into perspective, I think.Lewis:Yeah.

This fee will charge customers 40 cents for each minute they leave their cars at the stations once charging is complete.makeArticleAd();The supercharger idle fee isn't designed to make Tesla Motors Inc any money. Instead, the company claims that it just wants to make sure that the superchargers are available to those that really need them. Ablog postfrom TSLA compared leaving a charged car at a supercharging station to sitting at a gas pump once fueling is complete.Tesla Motors Inc is hoping to help customers avoid the supercharging idle fee in a couple of ways. The first involves its app. The app will notify customers when their car is almost charged, and again once it is fully charged. The second way is waiving fees for customers that move their vehicles away from the stations within 5 minutes of reaching full charge.Tesla Motors Inc also says it hopes to avoid this process completely in the future. The company has an interest in creating vehicles that can someday drive themselves away from the supercharging stations once they have a full charge.Tesla Motors Inc announced last month that it plans tobring an end to free supercharging. This change will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2017. It will only apply to customers that buy their cars after this date. However, these customers will still get 400 kWh of free supercharging credits each year.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 201710 Dangerous High-Yield Dividend Stocks to     Avoid5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberThe postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Institutes 'Supercharger Idle Fee'appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Riding a Bumpy Road to Profits;12/19/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you strip out theSolarCity Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY) acquisition,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) appears to be headed in the right direction. Tesla's last quarterly report ended a nasty losing streak in the earnings confessional, with the company besting expectations by more than 200%. What's more deliveries are up, and Tesla appears to be on track.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Via FlickrBut the SolarCity deal scuttled any vestige of bullish sentiment TSLA stock may have gained from its strong fundamental performance, leaving the bears in firm control.Now Tesla has a chance to reverse the situation, at least somewhat, when it releases its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report at the end of January.TSLA Stock by the NumbersBy the numbers, Wall Street expects Tesla to report a fourth-quarter loss of 8 cents per share - a vast improvement over the company's loss of 87 cents per share in the same quarter last year. What's more, revenue is expected to rise 30.6% to $2.28 billion.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017That said, sentiment is waning fast on TSLA stock. Fourth-quarter earnings targets have been revised sharply lower during the past two months, dropping from expectations for a profit of 49 cents per share during this time frame. Concerns range from Tesla hitting its deliveries target to the impact of the SolarCity acquisition, which will remain a major thorn in the company's side until the deal shows some positive impact.Taking a closer look at the brokerage community's expectations, Thomson/First Call report that only four of the 20 analysts following Tesla stock rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. What's more, the 12-month consensus price-target of $233.33 represents a modest premium of about 15% to yesterday's close.Elsewhere, short sellers continue to pile into bearish TSLA stock positions. As of the most recent reporting period, the number of Tesla shares sold short rose by 13% to 35.7 million. This wealth of shorted stock now accounts for nearly 30% of TSLA's total float, or shares available for public trading.Even options traders are jumping on the bearish TSLA stock bandwagon. Currently, the January 2017 put/call open interest ratio comes in at 1.83, with puts nearly doubling calls among near-term options. This ratio dips slightly to 1.19 for the weekly Jan. 27 series - i.e., those options most affected by Tesla's quarterly report, which is expected to arrive around Jan. 25 - giving some indication that short sellers are taking light precautions against a potential rally.Overall, January implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 7.3% for TSLA stock. This places the upper bound at $217.25, while the lower bound lies at $187.75.2 Trades for TSLA StockCall Spread:The negativity behind the SolarCity deal has to wane at some point, and a positive earnings report next month could go a long way toward mending the sentiment picture for TSLA stock. Furthermore, with so many naysayers on the sidelines, there is a wealth of potential buying fuel available to send the shares higher.Traders looking to take a contrarian stance on Tesla stock ahead of earnings might want to consider a weekly Jan 27 series $205/$210 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $2.25, or $225 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $206.94, while a maximum profit of $2.75, or $275 per pair of contracts, is possible if Tesla stock closes at or above $210 when weekly Jan. 27 series options expire.When Will Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Sap Investors' Patience?Put Sell:If selling premium is more your thing, then a weekly Jan. 27 series $170 put sell may be what you are looking for. At last check, this option was bid at $1.88, or $188 per contract.On the upside, you keep the premium received as long as Tesla stock closes above $170 when weekly Jan. 27 series options expire. On the downside, should TSLA trade below $170 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $170 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for 2017The 10 Best Vanguard Funds for 2017The postTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Riding a Bumpy Road to Profitsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM-Free Report),Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F-Free Report),Tesla Motors, Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),PACCAR Inc.(NASDAQ:PCAR-Free Report) andCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Should Automakers Fear a Trump Presidency?The U.S. auto industry has been experiencing a bull run for the last few years. Sales in 2016 are likely to be 17.5 million autos, in line with the figure recorded in the previous year. The trend is likely to continue into 2017, before dropping to the 16 million range.However, political events and market instability could lead to an early decline. President-elect Donald Trump's policies on imports and economic relations with other countries are expected to impact the industry significantly.One China PolicyThe U.S. auto industry may face challenges in the world's second largest economy due to political reasons. Trump's out-of-protocol decision to acknowledge communication from the President of Taiwan goes against the ""One China Policy"". This may hurt the U.S.-China trade relations. Trump asserted that the U.S. is not bound by the policy that categorizes Taiwan under ""one China"". This is likely to impact the friendly relations that have lasted for decades.While China is not expected to create any military pressure on the U.S., recently the nation's official newspaper China Daily revealed a state planning official's claim that the country will soon fine a U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior and price fixing. However, no particular company has been named by the official. While the article stated that nothing improper should be read into the matter, shares of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM-Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F-Free Report) were hit by the announcement. However, no official statement regarding the matter has been released by the government so far.Moreover, the U.S. and China may face other trade problems if Trump puts tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese imports, as per his previous announcements. Shares of Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) and PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ:PCAR-Free Report) also fell roughly 0.6% and 0.5% to close at $197.58 and $65.37, respectively, on Dec 15.Production ProblemsDuring his campaign, Trump had claimed to prevent outsourcing of manufacturing from the U.S. A number of domestic automakers plan to move the production of smaller cars to Mexico for cheap labor. They claim the production of small cars is not profitable in the U.S., unlike the SUVs which are sold for a higher price. The production can easily be shifted under The North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") but if Trump decides to call off the agreement, it may cause problems for automakers. His final policy on the increase of taxes on cars produced in Mexico and changes to NAFTA are expected to impact the auto industry significantly.Trump stated that he will not let car makers shift production facilities from the U.S. to Mexico as this will lead to a transfer of available jobs from U.S. to Mexico. Automakers, however, find it unprofitable to continue production of small cars in the country. Meanwhile, U.S. producers such as Ford and General Motors along with heavy equipment makers like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT-Free Report) and many of their suppliers have invested billions of dollars assuming the continuation of relatively open trade of U.S. with Mexico, China and other countries.Auto-Tires-Trucks Sector 5YR % ReturnWhere Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

However, if you're willing to turn over a lot of rocks, you'll   find that there are still a handful of stocks out there that   are trading for dirt-cheap prices.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Brookfield Property Partners(NYSE: BPY) ,Ford(NYSE: F) , andGamestop(NYSE: GME) are three such stocks, and better yet, they all offer   up huge dividend yields. Let's take a closer look at all three to   determine if they could be worth buying.A global real estate empireBrookfield Property Partners makes its money by buying real   estate assets such as office buildings, retail stores, and   multifamily properties, and it then leases out space in those   properties under long-term contracts. This business model   provides the company with a steady base of cash flow that   management uses to pay out an ever-rising distribution.Image source: Brookfield Property Partners.Brookfield's assets are currently worth $31 per unit, which is   up about 3% over the year-ago period. That's a solid growth rate   when you consider that the company took a hit on currency   fluctuations, and it also paid out $1.12 in annual distributions.   With shares currently trading under $22 per share, I think   Brookfield Property Partners is meaningfully undervalued.Thankfully, I'm not the only one who agrees. Management has   been buying back its units hand over fist, retiring more   than 2.8 million units in the last 15 months alone. With   shares trading at such a discount to their asset value, I think   that's a great use of capital.An auto giantInvestors haven't been showing large automakers like Ford   any love recently, and it's not hard to understand why. Auto   sales have been on fire in the lucrative North American market,   which is causing traders to worry that sales and profitsare peaking. If true, that could suggest that sales and profit margins are   currently unsustainably high, which means future profits growth   could stagnate, or even decline in the years ahead.If that wasn't enough to worry about, there's also the very   possibility that autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing   service could put a dent in auto sales over the long term. Mix in   the fact thatTesla Motorshas been rapidlytaking market share, and it's not hard to understand why traders are approaching the   company's stock with caution.Image source: Getty Images.All of those worries have weighed heavily on Ford's stock,   which is why the company is currently trading at less than six   times trailing earnings. When you combine that value price tag   with the company's rising dividend payments, Ford's dividend   yield has been above 4.5%.Despite all the doom and gloom, Ford does offer reasons   investors to be optimistic. The company is investing heavily to   mass produce a self-driving car for use in ride-hailing and   ride-sharing by 2021, which Ford believes could driveincreased profitabilityin the years ahead. In the meantime, Ford stock is so cheap,   investors could win by buying shares today.A business in transitionWith trailing and forward P/E ratios below seven, it   isn't much of a stretch to say that investors have written off   video-game retailer GameStop as ""dead money."" It's not hard to   understand the narrative that surrounds the company,   either. Comparable-store sales aredeclining, which is pulling down revenue and earnings per share. With   gamers continuing to shift their attention away   from physical products and toward digital offerings, it   isn't hard to paint this company's future as bleak.Image source: GameStop.However, GameStop's management team is certainly aware of   these industry dynamics, and they're investing accordingly.   GameStop is beefing up its digital and mobile offerings and   bundling them with physical game purchases. That helped drive a   54% jump in its tech brand sales division last quarter. The   company is also making a big push into the collectibles space   through its Think Geek brand, where revenue is growing rapidly.   Better still, these new areas are higher margin than its legacy   gaming business, so gross margins are actually on the   rise.Of course, it will still be some time before the company's   growth initiatives will fully offset the revenue   declines from its physical games business, which is why the   market isn't giving GameStop any credit. However, analysts do   believe these moves will pay off in the long term as   current estimates call for EPSgrowthof more than 7% over the next five years. That's a strong growth   rate for such an absurdly cheap stock. Add in a   dividend yield of 5.8%, and it's possible long-term investors   could do well by buying shares today.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

It’s Energy Storage's Time to Shine;12/18/2016;"Power storage has been a major topic of discussion within   energy industry circles, particularly in connection with   renewable energy, as technological advances appear poised to   bring with them a new level of innovation. Affordable storage   would allow for more renewable power sources on the grid, create   a path for customers to leave the grid, and even allow for new   innovations around dynamic loads in energy.The inconvenient truth is that until recently, energy storage   didn't have any financial justification. Theideaof value was there, but there was no actual value to create.   Rooftop solar power systems create energy and can offset demand   from other sources. The best energy storage systems can do is   move demand from one hour of the day to another, but doing that   was so expensive, it didn't make financial sense.What's changed recently is that utilities are starting to put   rate structures in place that will make energy storage more   economically viable. Ironically, their moves -- designed to   reduce the appeal of solar -- are providing the impetus for   innovation in the energy storage industry.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Where storage is hitting the grid todayThe initial uses of energy storage systems have been primarily   in commercial buildings and utility applications. A commercial   building can use storage to reduce demand charges -- fees based   on the peak consumption in a building every month. And utilities   are running pilot programs and even using stored power to patch   holes in the grid, as Southern California Edison did earlier this   year when it couldn't provide enough peak power to customers   after the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) swooped in and quickly built an 80 MWh energy   storage system to fill the gap.These are important applications, but they're also just the   tip of the iceberg. As costs fall and technology improves, we'll   see energy storage play a bigger role across the country.GTM Research estimates that 260 MW of energy storage will be   built in the U.S. in 2016, but that figure will jump to 478 MW in   2017 and 2,045 MW by 2021.Image source:GTM Research.Developers are just starting to scratch the surface of energy   storage's potential.What the future of storage looks likeThe economics of energy storage start to make sense as the   price of batteries come down. And that's when we'll see greater   adoption.In residential solar, customers will be able to use storage   systems to consume more of the energy generated directly from   their rooftop systems, rather than selling it back to utilities.   This was the intention of Tesla's Powerwall, and withSan Diego Gas & ElectricandPacific Gas & Electric-- two of the largest utilities in California -- transitioning   from traditional net metering to the time of use rates in Net   Metering 2.0, there will be more value to be extracted from good   storage systems.Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) are also bringing their own storage solutions to   homeowners, so look for the adoption of residential energy   storage to grow tremendously in 2017.Commercial energy storage will continue to be driven by   demand-charge reductions, but we could see more energy storage   systems installed for self-consumption as well.The segment to watch in 2017 is really utility scale storage.   We will likely see large batteries distributed throughout the   grid, capable of relieving pressure on the grid locally. I also   expect energy storage will begin being included in renewable   energy bids in the future. The large concentration of solar in   California has already led to a power consumption pattern that   has been dubbedthe duck curve: Demand on the grid drops off during day, followed by a large   increase as the sun goes down (taking solar out of the equation)   and most people get home from work. Energy storage systems built   in conjunction with renewable energy plants can help make the   duck curve less dramatic for the grid.Energy storage may start turning a new leafThe energy storage industry is in a similar position to where   solar was in 2010. The economics are starting to justify it for   some applications, and costs are rapidly coming down, opening new   opportunities in the market. That in turn will lead to new   innovations and product offerings. In short, 2017 may finally be   energy storage's time to shine.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft: Trump's Trade War Could End Badly;12/18/2016;"ByBlue Harbinger:Despite bygones, tech leaders and president elect Trump struck a friendly chord at this past Wednesday's Tech Summit held at the Trump Tower in New York. However, gleaning potential policies from the topics discussed (and Trump's campaign rhetoric) could spell trouble for several of the Tech Summit attendees, Microsoft (MSFT) in particular.This article provides a brief review of Microsoft's evolving business, several valuation metrics worth considering, and an overview of the potential impacts (positive and negative) of new policies that may come out of the Trump Administration such as those that would artificially create more US tech jobs, lower corporate tax rates, pressure interest rates higher, allow overseas cash repatriation, and utilize punitive tariffs with international trading partners.OverviewmakeArticleAd();Microsoft's business consists of three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (consists of Office and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (consists of public, private and hybrid server products and cloud services, includes Azure), and More Personal Computing (consists of Windows, devices, gaming, search advertising, Bing and eventually LinkedIn). And for reference, the following charts show the revenue and operating margin breakdown and growth trajectory of each segment.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(source: MSFTearnings slides)More Personal Computing is the biggest in terms of revenues, but has lower margins and is therefore the laggard in terms of operating income. And with regards to revenue growth, More Personal Computing (-1%) is also the laggard versus the other segments (+8% and +10%) on a year-over-year basis as shown in the following table.(click to enlarge)(source: MSFTearnings slides)With regards to Cloud, Microsoft seems to be the number two player (behind Amazon Web Services) in an extremely competitive space. Notwithstanding any mistakes, Cloud should provide Microsoft continued growth. Additionally, Microsoft's Productivity and Business Process Application provide some strong advantages and barriers to entry versus peers, as does the Windows operating system.For more perspective, the following graph shows how Microsoft's Windows for PCs is becoming a smaller part of Microsoft's revenue, and server products and tools are accelerating.And from a bottom line standpoint, Microsoft's net income remains healthy as revenues remain strong, as shown in the following chart.(click to enlarge)Additionally, Microsoft has provided a positive outlook whereby revenue in two of its three segments is expected to grow (Productivity and Business Processes plus Intelligent Cloud, but not More Personal Computing).(click to enlarge)Valuation MetricsFrom a price-to-earnings standpoint, Microsoft remains reasonably priced as shown in the following chart (taking the tech bubble era with a grain of salt).(click to enlarge)Additionally, a basic discounted free cash flow model suggests Microsoft has some price appreciation potential. Specifically, if we discount Microsoft's 2016Free Cash Flowof $25 billion, by its 11.85% weighted averagecostof capital and assume a 9.1% 5-year annual growth rate (this is the average estimate of the 8 professionalanalystssurveyed on Yahoo Finance), and a conservative 3-5% growth rate thereafter, then Microsoft is worth $465.0B to $580.4B after adjusting for outstanding long-term debt (-$60.2B) and cash and short-term investments (+$136.9B). On a per share basis, this amounts to a valuation between $59.76 and $74.61, which gives Microsoft current share price roughly 8% upside versus the midpoint of the range.Worth noting, Microsoft pays a healthy dividend. The dividend yield currently sits at around 2.4% (as shown in the following chart) which is above average for Microsoft and above average for an S&P 500 company, particularly one in the technology sector.(click to enlarge)A higher than average dividend yield from a blue chip company like Microsoft can be a signal from management that they believe their stock price should be higher (which would mathematically bring the dividend yield closer to the historical norm, ceteris paribus). Worth noting, Microsoft's dividend payments are well covered as shown in the following chart.(click to enlarge)In essence, Microsoft is a stable company with an above average dividend and the potential for more growth and share price appreciation.New Administration PoliciesIt is worth considering the potential policy changes (and their impact on Microsoft) that might come out of the Trump Administration following this past week's ""Tech Summit"" (attended by Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Larry Page, Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins, IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich, Oracle (ORCL) CEO Safra Catz, and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, to name a few).Specifically, we consider policies that may artificially create more US tech jobs, lower corporate tax rates, pressure interest rates higher, allow overseas cash repatriation, and utilize punitive tariffs.1. More US JobsFor starters, one of Trump's biggest themes is US jobs creation. However, the types of jobs he's talking about (middle class manufacturing jobs) aren't going to help Microsoft, and his views on highly skilled international workers may actually harm Microsoft significantly. For example, Trump has been critical of H1B visas, claiming they take jobs away from Americans. In our view, H1B jobs help Microsoft attract the talent it needs to remain successful. Forexample…""Microsoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H1B visas,   which allow companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign   workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it   difficult to hire employees for the company, stating ""I'd   certainly get rid of the H1B cap."" Critics of H1B visas argue   that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment   for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower   salaries.""Additionally, Trump may attempt to force more manufacturing jobs into the US, rather than allowing US companies to trade more freely with international partners (for example, Trump wants to see Apple's iPhone manufactured in the US, despite daunting economical headwinds). Generally speaking, international trade can increase productivity and efficiency by allowing each partner to focus on what they're best at, and then allowing trade so each partner can obtain what it needs. Policies restricting international trade could particularly impact Microsoft considering ""as of June 30, 2016, Microsoft employed approximately 114,000 people on a full-time basis, 63,000 in the U.S. and 51,000 internationally; and also according to Microsoft ""Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue…"") (2016 Microsoft Annual Report). Overall, Trump may be able to create some new US jobs with his pro-growth agenda, but if he restricts free trade and H1B visas he could significantly hurt Microsoft in particular.2. Lowering Corporate Tax RatesWith regards to lowering corporate tax rates (another one of Trump's consistent themes), this is a no-brainer (in a good way) for US business, but it may help Microsoft less than some of its peers given its already relatively low effective tax rate as shown in the following chart.(click to enlarge)The theory is that by lowering taxes on corporations, it will make them more competitive internationally. It will also, in theory, prevent companies from relocating to other countries with lower tax rates and taking away US jobs when they relocate. However, as the above chart shows, Microsoft already has a lower effective tax rate than many of its peers. Lower corporate tax rates could help Microsoft on the margin, but competitively less so than its peers. Arguably, Trump could spur the overall economy by lowering tax rates across all market sectors which would eventually trickle down to Microsoft, but in the immediate term a lower corporate tax policy is likely to help Microsoft less than other companies.3. Raising Interest RatesThe Fed sets interest rates, not the President, but Trump's aggressive growth agenda could speed up the economy resulting in the Fed acting sooner to raise rates faster and this could actually help Microsoft given its large cash balance that currently earns very low interest (i.e. higher interest rates mean Microsoft could earn a higher rate of return on its cash). And granted, much of the $137 billion in cash on Microsoft's balance sheet is overseas, but in theory the US can lead interest rates around the world higher if it's successfully able to accelerate growth.4. Repatriating Non-US CashAs the following chart shows, Microsoft has a very large amount of foreign cash. And given the currently high tax rates to repatriate this cash, companies aren't doing it.If the Trump Administration were to orchestrate a tax deal whereby companies could pay less tax, then they'd likely be willing to bring that cash back to the US. This would be a ""win-win"" in the sense that the lower tax rate would allow companies to bring the cash back to the US and create more US growth and US profits, while still allowing the government to collect some revenue from the lower taxation rate on the repatriation. This is a potential Trump policy that actually makes sense and could benefit Microsoft.5. International TradeDonald Trump has expressed a combative attitude towards international trading partners. For example, he is not happy with China, and according to hiswebsite, he wants to:""...label China a currency manipulator.""""…bring trade cases against China, both in this country and   at the WTO. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the   terms of its entrance to the WTO.""""Use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes   if China does not stop its illegal activities, including its   theft of American trade secrets - including the application of   tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of   1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.""However, if Trump starts a trade war with China, China has the ability (and a track record) to inflict pain on US companies. For example, during the early 2000s, China openly allowed pirated copies of Microsoft Windows to be sold in most big cities for only around $1 (clearly this was not good for Microsoft). And it would be easy for China to allow similar cases going forward if Trump takes any aggressive actions. As another example, China is already flooding US markets with too much steel and aluminum which is keeping prices artificially low and hurting US producers. As yet another example, China has a reputation for manipulating its currency thereby making its exports very inexpensive.If Trump starts a trade war with China (he did threaten a 45% tariff during his campaign), or any other country for that matter, it could end badly for all US companies, especially those with significant non-US business, such as Microsoft (e.g. Microsoft has 51,000 international employees, and international operations provide a significant portion of Microsoft's total revenue).ConclusionThings could end badly for a lot of tech companies, especially Microsoft, if the new administration follows through on some of its aggressive policy ideas, particularly with regards to international trade. However, despite the policy-related risks, we've still ranked Microsoft #7 on our list of top7 Tech Stocks Worth Consideringbecause we suspect cooler minds will prevail, thereby making Microsoft attractive because of its strong evolving business, above average dividend yield, and relatively attractive valuation.See alsoThe Market Simply Can't Go Much Higheron seekingalpha.com"

1 Major Problem With General Motors' New All-Electric Bolt;12/16/2016;"Appleco-founder Steve Wozniak has long been known as an early adopter   willing to give new products a shot early in their lifecycles.   Unsurprisingly, he has been a vocal owner of aTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S -- perhaps the geekiest car on the planet.   And in September, Wozniak said onFacebookhe would be switching toGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) new all-electric Chevrolet Bolt when it came out.Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors.makeArticleAd();General Motors was certainly happy about Woz's decision. In a   November press conference at the LA Auto Show about the Bolt, the   company highlighted Wozniak's decision to switch to a Bolt,   showing a slide saying, ""Apple co-founder ditching   Tesla."" Woz's decision to buy the Bolt signaled just how   compelling the Bolt was, even to early adopters.But now that the Bolt is here, Wozniak has changed his mind,   instead buying an additional Model S.What happened? Woz is concerned about the feasibility of the   vehicle on road trips, he said on Facebook this week.While Wozniak's story represents the opinion of only one   person, it highlights a major problem with the new Bolt: Its   maximum charging rate is too slow.Woz bolts on the Bolt... for now""I'm concerned about how it would work on our favored road   trips,"" Wozniak said about the Bolt on Facebook. ""So far, Tesla's   the only game in town for that.""Wozniak was likely referring to how much longer it will take   to charge a Bolt. The 50-kilowatt charge the Bolt can handle is   well below the 20 kW of power that a Model S can handle. To   be fair, Wozniak is still considering the Bolt, he said on   Facebook. ""It had a lot of things nicer about it than the Tesla,""   he noted. But General Motors might have to improve the Bolt's   charging speed first.Tesla Superchargers span major highways in the U.S. Western   Europe, and China. Image source: The Motley Fool.The Bolt's website details the Bolt's charge rate: ""Bolt EV   offers DC Fast Charging capability, which provides up to 90 miles   of range in about 30 minutes of charge time."" Going further,   General Motors boldly asserts that, ""By the time you finish a cup   of coffee, you'll be powered up and so will your Bolt EV."" But   this description doesn't truly capture what the charging   experience will be like for Bolt owners.With over 200 miles of range, Bolt owners will likely charge   at home for their daily driving. So the most likely situation in   which Bolt owners would need to stop to charge would be when they   are traveling long distances. And on road trips, Bolt owners will   likely want to charge more than 90 miles, so they should probably   plan for a long dinner instead of a coffee -- a full charge will   take about two hours.Will this impact demand?It's possible Wozniak would have never considered the Bolt in   the first place if he had been aware of how slowly the Bolt would   charge. As Electrekpoints out, GM hadn't actually confirmed the Bolt's maximum charging rate   at the time. Given that the Bolt uses a 60 kilowatt-hour battery   -- a battery capacity Tesla has used in its vehicles before --   buyers would assume the Bolt could handle a charging rate as   powerful as a Model S can. But according to General Motors'   website, the Bolt charge ismuchslower than a Tesla vehicle. For comparison, a Model S's 120 kW   charge can deliver about 170 miles of range in around 30   minutes.Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors.Sure, the Bolt's $37,500 price tag is much lower than the   Model S's $68,000 starting price, helping justify its much slower   charging rate. But there's no reason Tesla's $35,000 Model 3,   which the electric-car maker plans to begin delivering by the end   of next year, won't be able to match the Model S's charging   rate.As Bolt customers recognize this flaw with General Motors'   newest technology, Woz might not be the only Chevrolet customer   bolting.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Automakers Fear a Trump Presidency?;12/16/2016;"The U.S. auto industry has been experiencing a bull run for the last few years. Sales in 2016 are likely to be 17.5 million autos, in line with the figure recorded in the previous year. The trend is likely to continue into 2017, before dropping to the 16 million range.However, political events and market instability could lead to an early decline. President-elect Donald Trump's policies on imports and economic relations with other countries are expected to impact the industry significantly.One China PolicyThe U.S. auto industry may face challenges in the world's second largest economy due to political reasons. Trump's out-of-protocol decision to acknowledge communication from the President of Taiwan goes against the ""One China Policy"". This may hurt the U.S.-China trade relations. Trump asserted that the U.S. is not bound by the policy that categorizes Taiwan under ""one China"". This is likely to impact the friendly relations that have lasted for decades.While China is not expected to create any military pressure on the U.S., recently the nation's official newspaper China Daily revealed a state planning official's claim that the country will soon fine a U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior and price fixing. However, no particular company has been named by the official. While the article stated that nothing improper should be read into the matter, shares of General Motors CompanyGMand Ford Motor CompanyFwere hit by the announcement. However, no official statement regarding the matter has been released by the government so far.Moreover, the U.S. and China may face other trade problems if Trump puts tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese imports, as per his previous announcements. Shares of Tesla Motors, Inc.TSLAand PACCAR IncPCARalso fell roughly 0.6% and 0.5% to close at $197.58 and $65.37, respectively, on Dec 15.Production ProblemsDuring his campaign, Trump had claimed to prevent outsourcing of manufacturing from the U.S. A number of domestic automakers plan to move the production of smaller cars to Mexico for cheap labor. They claim the production of small cars is not profitable in the U.S., unlike the SUVs which are sold for a higher price. The production can easily be shifted under The North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") but if Trump decides to call off the agreement, it may cause problems for automakers. His final policy on the increase of taxes on cars produced in Mexico and changes to NAFTA are expected to impact the auto industry significantly.Trump stated that he will not let car makers shift production facilities from the U.S. to Mexico as this will lead to a transfer of available jobs from U.S. to Mexico. Automakers, however, find it unprofitable to continue production of small cars in the country. Meanwhile, U.S. producers such as Ford and General Motors along with heavy equipment makers like Caterpillar Inc.CATand many of their suppliers have invested billions of dollars assuming the continuation of relatively open trade of U.S. with Mexico, China and other countries.Auto-Tires-Trucks Sector 5YR % ReturnAuto-Tires-Trucks Sector 5YR % ReturnWhere Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

But while Google expects Waymo to become a revenue source soon, it's been attacked for seemingly falling behind in the self-driving car race.Source:Travis Wise via FlickrWaymo CEO John Krafcik, who by the way is an auto-industry veteran, made it clear that Waymo isn't a car company.makeArticleAd();He said Alphabet's self-driving car business is into making better drivers. TheWall Street Journalparaphrased Krafcik assaying, ""[Krafcik] saw opportunities in ride sharing, transportation logistics and trucking, as well as licensing technology to other auto makers.""There were no definite statements on how the company intends to generate revenue, either. What is clear is that GOOGL is unlikely to make its own self-driving cars and investors should appreciate Alphabet's approach. Here's why.Google Leads the Self-Driving Car RaceIn recent months, Google's beencriticized for slacking offin the self-driving car race.

That's because there are around 70,000 autopilot-enabled Tesla cars on the road.Critics have pointing to moves by traditional automakers likeGeneral Motors Company's(NYSE:GM) acquisition ofCruise Automation, and Tesla's Autopilot, among others, as proof that GOOGL is now in the back seat. Areportfrom earlier this year on howToyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM) had the highest number of patents related to self-driving cars also helped them buttress their points.After all, Toyota had over a thousand patents as of when the report was published, while GOOGL only had a few hundred patents. However, what's not being said is that the patents Alphabet holds are mostly related to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-Infrastructure (V2I) technologies.For instance, GOOGL received apatentthat could prevent autonomous car collision victims from being dragged under the car earlier this year.Considering that Google was a pioneer and it doesn't have the most patents, it seems the company has always known the route it would take, which wouldn't be making cars. Obviously, other automakers will need these V2V and V2I technologies to make self-driving cars work well with the surrounding.The idea goes, ""Allow them to make the self-driving cars, they'll pay us to help connect their cars to the surrounding."" Sidewalk and Nest are likely a big part of Waymo because of what they stand for.GOOGL Stock Is Well-PositionedAlphabet's decision not to make its own cars is a good one, and GOOGL stock holders should applaud it. Traditional auto-manufacturing is already highly capital intensive. A futuristic auto manufacturing business is probably going to be even more capital intensive. The huge capital outlay that building its own car will require might not be worth it, as this is an unproven market.Moreover, as Tesla is showing, it's not easy to break even in the car-making business. So making its own cars wouldn't have been the best route to profitability. However, the opportunities that Krafcik outlined are relatively less capital intensive. The translation is that it will be much easier for GOOGL to own a profitable self-driving business going this route.Stay Far, Far Away From Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)     Stock in 2017Looking at it from the perspective of risk-taking, I believe Alphabet knows what it is doing. As stated above, this market is unproven. Therefore, by licensing its technologies, going into car sharing, etc., GOOGL stock is shielded from the worst-case scenario of self-driving cars failing.But even if self-driving cars fail, its technologies can still be monetized because the auto industry will keep evolving technologically. For investors looking to take a relatively safe bet on self-driving cars, GOOGL stock presents one of your best options.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace4 BlackRock ETFs to Buy for Steady Retirement     IncomeThe 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017The postYou Got It Wrong.

Is Ford Motor Company (F) Stock a Good Value?;12/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'll tell you right off the bat. The answer to whetherFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) is a good value is … well, maybe.Source:Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)I know that's not the answer you want to hear. But there are a lot of factors to take into consideration when evaluating Ford stock, whether it be individually or relative to its peers. So it just won't be a simple answer.makeArticleAd();In my opinion,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) stock is thebettervaluewhen head-to-head with Ford. Of course, up againstTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), F stock suddenly becomes extremely cheap at 0.33 times sales versus 5.75 times for Elon Musk's wonderful business.And that's why ultimately, despite many metrics to determine it, value is subjective, not objective. You'll never truly know a stock's intrinsic value, which is what people like Warren Buffett use to determine a stock's margin of safety.Ford's Position Says a LotBut what youcando is examine Ford's position within its three key markets of Europe, China and the U.S. compared to its peers.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017Asking two questions about each of these markets, I'll know how Ford's business stacks up against the others. If it does well on these questions, the notion of good value takes care of itself.Is it growing in each of these markets, and if so, by how   much?Who is growing faster and why?Ford - Unit Sales by marketMarketNovember 2016 SalesGrowth2016 YTD SalesGrowthEurope 78,7922.1%967,675 3.6% China 124,11317.0%1.1M 10.7% U.S. 197,5745.2%2.4M 0.04%So, Ford is growing sales in each of these markets, although its year-to-date numbers in the U.S. leave a lot to be desired. Otherwise, I think Ford is doing a very good job in its three main markets.GM - Unit Sales by marketMarketNovember 2016 SalesGrowth2016 YTD SalesGrowthEurope 74,695-1.1%923,759 5.6% China 371,7407.0%3.4M 8.5% U.S. 197,6097.9%2.2M 1.6%Fiat Chrysler - Unit Sales by marketMarketNovember 2016 SalesGrowth2016 YTD SalesGrowthEurope 75,26510.1%918,634 14.2% China N/M N/M N/M N/M U.S. 160,827-14.3%2.0M 1.0%On the second question of who's growing more and why; that becomes a bit of a tricky issue.As much as possible, I've tried to report the retail vehicle sales of each of the Big Three in these three main markets. However, each of the car companies has a particular way of reporting, or not reporting, a particular month's unit sales and those year-to-date.I challenge you to come up with a figure forFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE:FCAU) in China. Its annual report says it sold139,000vehicles in the country for the entire 2015, down 18.7% from 2014. What it has done in 2016, I really couldn't say.That's really too bad, because FCAU is taking Ford and GM to the mat when it comes to their competition in Europe. And they're not doing horribly in the U.S. where they've always been a distant third in the Motor City.At a price-to-sales ratio of 0.1 and Sergio Marchionne at the helm, I do like FCAU as a potential deep value play.If you look at the China and U.S. markets as one, Ford and GM are basically doing about the same in terms of growth with Ford winning in China and GM in the U.S.Is Ford Stock Good Value?As I said earlier, if I had to pick one of the two on a relative value basis, I'd go with GM. However, I'd say Ford is good value relative to its own historical valuation metrics.Sell Your Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock at a Decent     Price ... While You CanThe problem for me is that I'm skeptical of all car companies as investments. They require way too much capital for the profits they generate and the risks they present.In the case of Ford, it's committed to making lots of small cars inMexico- it wants to move Ford Focus production from Michigan - because consumers don't like to pay too much for smaller cars. If Trump decides to carry out his hate-on for Mexico, Ford's going to get caught in the tariff crossfire.But hey, if you want to own stock in a car company, you could do worse than Ford.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBest Stocks for 2017: Citigroup Inc (C) Stock     Is UndervaluedThe 10 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The postIs Ford Motor Company (F) Stock a Good Value?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Elon Musk's Inclusion in Trump's Tech Summit Matters;12/16/2016;"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President-elect   Donald Trump don't exactly see eye to eye. The two clash strongly   in one particular area: global warming. Trump has openly   disagreed with global warming and Musk has embarked on an   ambitious vision to help put an end to it. The election of Trump   to president, therefore, has prompted some uncertainty   surrounding how the presidency will impact Tesla, which aims to   accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy by   building and selling electric cars, energy storage, and solar   products.Elon Musk. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();But Musk may have been encouraged recently when he was invited   to President-elect Donald Trump's Tech Summit in New York City at   Trump Tower.Musk goes to Trump TowerThe invitations for Trump's Tech Summit went out earlier this   month to executives of major tech companies. Beyond Musk,   attendees of the event this week included prominent names likeApple's Tim Cook,Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos,Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, andIntel's Brian Krzanich. With less than a dozen tech leaders attending,   invitations were scant, limited only to the tech elite.""I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to   come to this meeting,"" said Trump in his opening remarks.Based on the sentiment expressed by Trump in the short portion   of the meeting made public, the future President said he wanted   to help things go smoothly for the companies represented.I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well. ...     we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation.     There's nobody like you in the world. ... And, anything we can     do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you.     You'll call my people. You'll call me, it doesn't make any     difference. We have no formal chain of command around here.     We're going to do fair trade deals, we're going to make it a     lot easier for you to trade.As Electrekpointed out, Musk's inclusion in the tech summit meeting is particularly   notable considering the visionary entrepreneur is the only one   leading a company with a market capitalization below $150   billion. Tesla is currently valued at about $32 billion, and   Musk's privately held SpaceX's recent funding valued the company   at about $15 billion. So Musk is arguably lucky to be able to   represent his companies.And Musk apparently received some special attention. Notably,   Trump's transition team's communication director Jason Miller   said Apple's Cook and Musk were going to stick around after the   tech summit event for a private meeting with Trump, according to   AppleInsider.Musk has also been honored with a spot on Trump's Strategic   and Policy forum. A press release about the forum says it   includes ""some of America's most highly respected and successful   business leaders"" who ""will be called upon to meet with the   President frequently to share their specific experience and   knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda."" Musk,   as well as Uber's Travis Kalanick andPepsi's Indra Nooyi were added to the forum a few weeks after the   Trump administration announced 16 other names, including   influential business leaders likeJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon andWalt Disney's Bob Iger.What Musk and Trump have in commonIf the only remarks from Musk during the meeting at Trump   Tower were any indication of the foot the CEO plans to put   forward with the president, Musk seems like he wants to emphasize   Tesla's vision for manufacturing job growth in the U.S. -- an   area Trump has said he will focus on.Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Image source: The Motley   Fool.""Building rockets and cars and solar stuff in the U.S. --   actually really excited about expanding our manufacturing   footprint in the U.S.,"" Musk said when he introduced himself at   the meeting.Tesla alone has created about 30,000 jobs, most of which are   in the U.S. and are manufacturing related. And Tesla also   recently announced an expansion to its car factory in Fremont,   California, and said it plans toadd another 3,000 jobs there. Going further, the company plans to eventually employ about   9,000 people at its under-construction battery factory in Nevada   and 1,000 people at its solar-panel factory in Buffalo, New York.   Further, Tesla has inspired auto, defense, and solar companies   all over the world to step up their games.With Trump clearly willing to give Musk his ear, and   considering Musk's important role in U.S. manufacturing job   creation, Musk's companies are off to a good start with the   president-elect.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2 Risks Qualcomm Will Face After Acquiring NXP Semiconductors;12/16/2016;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) seems to have opened the door to automotive riches   with its pending acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . NXPcurrently holds14.5% share in the automotive semiconductor market, which is   expected to be worth $36 billion by 2019, and Qualcomm is buying   the lead in this fast-growing market with its pending $47 billion   purchase of NXP.However, Qualcomm's NXP acquisition does not ensure that the   former will become the dominant player in the automotive   semiconductor business, as it will face a stiff challenge fromInfineon Technologies(NASDAQOTH: IFNNY) . Additionally, Qualcomm might face   integration and margin challenges once the merger is   complete.makeArticleAd();Why Infineon could pose a strong challengeInfineon Technologies is the second-largest supplier of chips   to the automotive industry with an estimated market share of   10.4% to NXP's 14.5%. This means that Infineon does not lag NXP   by a huge margin. What's more, in 2015, Infineon led NXP in two   of the three subsegments in the automotive semiconductor   market.Image source: Infineon Technologies.Infineon led NXP in the market for power and sensor chips in   the automotive industry last year. These two markets were worth   $11.3 billion. In comparison, NXP led Infineon by a huge margin   in the microcontroller segment, which was alone worth $6.5   billion.In the long run, Infineon can close the gap on NXP as it is   the leading supplier of drivetrain solutions to electric   vehicles. Infineon supplied its drivetrain solutions to seven of   the top 10 electric vehicles in terms of sales last year. It   counts the likes ofTesla Motors,BMW, Chevrolet,Volkswagen, and BYD Tang as its customers. This puts Infineon in a strong   position in this market as it projects that sales of electric   vehicles will grow from just 400,000 units in 2015 to 10 million   units in 2025.Along with pending growth in the number of electric vehicles   -- which accounted for less than 1% of market share in 2015 --   the amount of semiconductor content is also expected to grow.   Infineon forecasts that the semiconductor bill of materials in an   EV will be as much as $705 per vehicle by 2025. In comparison,   the chip content in each vehicle last year was $332, according to   NXP.EVs will carry higher chip content as compared to   internal-combustion-engine-based vehicles becausethe electric drivetrain used in EVs contains a lot of electronics   for power switching. The electronic systems in a hybrid   drivetrain route power from the battery to the motor through an   inverter, while no such electronic systems are needed in an   internal-combustion engine.According to McKinsey, the average hybrid drivetrain contains   10 times the semiconductor content as compared to an   internal-combustion drivetrain. As a result, the demand for   insulated-gate bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, will continue   increasing as they play an important role in EV power   systems.Infineon enjoys a strong position in the IGBT market with a   market share of 27.6%. In 2015, the IGBT market was worth $3.94   billion, according to Infineon, and some estimates put it at $6   billion in revenue by 2018.So, Infineon could bridge the market share gap over NXP in the   long run on the back of EV growth.Integration challengesQualcomm's acquisition of NXP will have a negative margin   impact on the former. This is because Qualcomm's gross margin   profile is higher than that of NXP. For example, in the recently   reported third quarter, NXP posted a non-GAAP gross margin of   50.5%. In comparison, Qualcomm's gross profit margin in the third   quarter stood at 58% .Thus, as Qualcomm begins to integrate NXP after the merger is   complete in 2017, the gross margin might start deteriorating. The   higher gross margin profile of Qualcomm is a result of its   fabless manufacturing model as it outsources its chip   manufacturing to foundries such asSamsung.On the other hand, NXP has a foundry-based business model. It   has 14 chip manufacturing facilities, along with seven packaging   and testing facilities. However, these facilities can't   manufacture chips for Qualcomm as they are ""outdated,"" according   toMarket Realist. This reduces one potential synergy from the acquisition.Despite this hiccup, the NXP acquisition is expected to   deliver $500 million in annual cost synergies for Qualcomm within   two years after the closure of the transaction. However, 65% of   the savings will be on the operating expense side as Qualcomm   will be able to use NXP's existing relationships to sell its   automotive and Internet of Things products.Qualcomm will also reduce its cost of goods sold as the   combined companies can negotiate for lower raw material prices   from suppliers. The reduction in the cost of goods sold will   account for 35% of the cost-saving synergy from the acquisition.   The reason the cost of goods sold synergies will be significantly   lower than the operating expense reduction is because Qualcomm   will not make much gains on the manufacturing side of the   business due to the difference in the foundry business.Also, given the legacy nature of the foundries, it is likely   that NXP won't be getting Qualcomm's money to upgrade them. This   is because Qualcomm has a different business model of outsourcing   its manufacturing, and investing in NXP's foundries would lead to   an increase in costs.Although NXP will definitely add another dimension to   Qualcomm's business, we've seen that it will also have a negative   gross margin impact and pose integration issues. Additionally,   the threat from Infineon cannot be ignored.So even though Qualcomm is making a smart move by acquiring   NXP Semiconductors, it is not guaranteed a smooth journey toward   automotive riches.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is on My Buy Radar;12/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsShares ofTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), while still lower by close to 18% year-to-date, have shown   good absolute and relative strength over the past week and a   half. Although still not out of the woods just yet, TSLA stock is   increasingly coiling up for a potentially better move to the   upside.Earlier this week, I met with a few client investors. Among other   things, we discussed the importance of exercising patience in   trading and investing. Tesla stock was one of the example stocks   I discussed because although TSLA is beginning to look more   technically sound for a next leg higher, it has been a painful   equity for impatient traders expecting explosive moves (in either   direction).makeArticleAd();One of the best lessons I ever received from a former trading   mentor was that sometimes there are simply no   high-probability trades to be had in any given stock or index,   for an extended period of time. Patience is a virtue both in life   and in trading. The best traders I have met throughout my career   have an uncanny ability to simply sit on their hands until the   best probability trade flashes. Specifically, they let the   stock price come to them (i.e., to their price levels of interest   where they see a good risk/reward equation).They don't chase, and that would be my advice on TSLA   stock.TSLA Stock ChartsWith that in mind, on Tesla's multiyear weekly chart, note   that since early 2014, shares have largely been stuck in a   sideways (albeit sometimes volatile) trading range. TSLA has seen   some over- and under-shooting of this range here and there.But in the bigger picture, the stock is stuck in a wide   trading range where dips were to be bought and rallies to be   sold.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Over the past month or so, TSLA stock has once again found   support at the lower end of the trading range, which currently   also coincides with the red 200-week simple moving average. From   a momentum perspective, we see at the bottom of the chart that   the blue Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is slowly   starting to turn higher as well.Click to EnlargeWhile this all looks more promising, it's no cigar just yer. I   still need to see a better and stronger bullish reversal off the   horizontal support area around $185.When I last discussed Tesla stock onNov. 28, I highlighted the very early stages of selling exhaustion   and said that less risk-averse active investors could consider   taking initial long positions in the stock against the $180 area   as a stop-loss.So far, this support area is holding, and TSLA shares   have seen a new rally with a marginal high against the late   November highs.On the daily chart, we see that over the past couple of   trading days, Tesla Motors attempted to break past diagonal   resistance from the April highs.

Why Electric-Car Fans Should Watch Lucid Motors Closely;12/15/2016;"Electric-car start-up Lucid Motors unveiled its first product   in a media event in California on Wednesday. Lucid's Air is a   sleek high-performance sedan that will have specifications and   pricing calibrated to compete directly withTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .This is significant, and investors interested in electric and   self-driving cars should sit up and take note. The Lucid Air is   no flight of designer fancy. It's a serious product, and Lucid is   a serious company that stands an excellent chance of succeeding.   Read on.makeArticleAd();The Lucid Air is an electric luxury sports sedan that promises   long range, thrilling performance, and advanced self-driving   capabilities. Image source: Lucid Motors.About the carThe Lucid Air is a big luxury sedan that promises to combine   extreme high performance with a roomy, comfortable, and quiet   interior equipped with a lot of advanced technology.Like the top Tesla models, the Lucid Air should be very fast,   at least in a straight line. It might be even faster: Lucid   claims ""best-in-class energy density"" for the Air's 100   kilowatt-hour battery pack, which it says will give the Air ""in   excess"" of 300 miles of range.Once the Air is in production, a 130 kWh battery pack will be   available as an optional upgrade. That will offer ""up to"" 400   miles of range and ""up to"" 1,000 horsepower. Both figures are a   step ahead of what Tesla's current top-performing models can   deliver right now.Image source: Lucid Motors.Lucid's battery packs will use a new lithium-ion battery cell   developed by the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) that promises ""breakthrough battery life,""   according to Lucid's chief technology officer, Peter   Rawlinson.The Air's motor and transmission unit was developed entirely   in-house, Lucid said. It claims that it's ""smaller, more   efficient and more power-dense than competitors, while   potentially more reliable."" (The word ""potentially"" is doing a   lot of work in that sentence. But as we'll see, Lucid's engineers   are not new to the car business.)Inside, Lucid promises ""executive seating"" with cushy,   reclining rear seats that offer comfort and legroom comparable to   first-class airline seats. A 29-speaker audio system will provide   active noise cancellation to ensure that it's a quiet space.As you'd expect from a Silicon Valley automaker, self-driving   technology will be built in. Lucid will aim to have the Air   equipped with ""Level 4"" self-driving capability at launch,   pending approval by U.S. regulators. ""Level 4"" systems can take   full control of the vehicle under most (but not all) conditions,   with little to no involvement from the human driver.The Lucid Air's back seat is scaled for adult comfort. Image   source: Lucid Motors.Lucid hasn't finalized pricing for the Air. But it said that a   fully loaded ""launch edition"" will be priced around $160,000,   with standard versions starting around $85,000. Lucid hopes to   get the starting price down to around $65,000 in time.If all goes according to plan, production of the Air will   begin in late 2018. But some big things have to happen in order   for that plan to pan out.Is this vaporware, or is it for real?It's for real. This is not vaporware. It could turn out to be   a big deal. But there are some caveats that come with that   statement.For starters, Lucid is a real company, founded in 2007. It has   about 330 employees, many with past experience at Tesla or at   large global automakers. Its chief designer, Derek Jenkins, was   formerly the director of design atMazdaNorth America. And Peter Rawlinson, the chief technology   officer, came to Lucid with one of the greatest electric-car   resume credentials possible: He was chief engineer on the Tesla   Model S.In some ways, the Lucid Air can be thought of as the Model S   2.0. It's averyserious, advanced design that reads in many ways as a redesigned   Model S informed by experience. And it's clearly very close to   production-ready. It's not a show car.The shape of the Air's roof allows plenty of rear-seat   headroom. Image source: Lucid Motors.But that's where the caveats come in: Right now, Lucid doesn't   have a factory in which to build the Air or anything else.It has a site for a factory, in Casa Grande, Arizona, selected   for its proximity to key auto-industry suppliers in Mexico. It   has a package of subsidies promised by the Arizona state   government, and a detailed plan to start constructing the $700   million facility in the second quarter of 2017.But it will need to raise money to make the factory a fully   functional operation. Lucid has said that future fundraising   rounds are planned, but it hasn't yet given specifics.So should we take Lucid Motors seriously?I think we should. Lucid seems to be positioning itself as a   sober-minded (""lucid"") alternative to Tesla, in part by making a   point of being entirely focused on electric automobiles. It   doesn't have a whiz-bang CEO like Elon Musk -- but Lucid (which   employs a lot of Tesla veterans, remember) might argue that   Musk's outsized public image and futuristic visions take   attention away from Tesla's products in the here and now.If anything, Lucid seems quietly determined to learn from (and   not repeat) Tesla's missteps. It won't rush the Air into   production nor let itself get distracted by far-future visions.   That ""lucid"" attitude, the car itself, and the serious cash   already invested in the company make it worth close attention as   its plan unfolds.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Shrugs Off a Q4 Earnings Beat;12/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) said on Thursday that it registered 22% year-over-year growth in revenues for its fiscal fourth quarter. After digesting the number for a few minutes, the stock … well, people still weren't sure what to do with ADBE stock.Source:Marcin Wichary via FlickrAn initial negative reaction immediately after the bell might have represented confusion over GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, or it might have been a reaction to conservative estimates for 2017 growth from the company.makeArticleAd();Many analyst estimates use non-GAAP earnings, and estimates were for86 cents per shareon that front. The non-GAAP number came in at 90 cents, but the reported GAAP number was just 80 cents per share. What looked like a miss on expectations turned out to be a beat. Adobe has now beaten earnings estimates for 12 consecutive quarters.Net income for the quarter came in at $399.613 million, onrevenue of $1.608 billion.While Adobe pays no dividend, the company bought back 3.2 million shares during the quarter for $331 million, supporting the price of ADBE stock.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017Still, as after-hours trading went on, some investors saw the beat as a reason to split. The company's strong performance over the past few years has pushed the price-to-earnings ratio to 53. A few of those who enjoyed the ride decided to take profits.Adobe Stock: A Bargain Measured in MinutesThe initial negative reaction in ADBE shares caused analysts to call the numbers a good opportunity to buy the stock, which is up 15% over the last year and 275% over the last five years.As I wrote in previewing the numbers, Adobe is getting a payoff from its past investments in cloud computing, selling more of its graphics and marketing software via subscription instead of through physical media.All segments of the company showed growth. About two-thirds of revenue comes from digital media tools, and 30% from marketing, with just 3% now coming from the fading print and publishing segment that made Adobe famous in the 1980s.The Cloud, The Cloud, The CloudCloud creates a virtuous circle for software companies. Revenues come in regularly through subscription, past use of the software almost guarantees renewals, and costs for maintaining files on cloud goes down over time.Adobe entered the cloud era with a big lead in creative software, and has used its advantages to grow in marketing software. The one revenue problem remains the ""document cloud,"" essentially a storage service, where revenue is stagnant as customers take advantage of cloud economics.Still to come is revenuefrom Sensei- a set of intelligent services announced last month that are being built into its cloud platforms that can help marketing departments avoid mistakes like putting the wrong city background on an ad, using images for which the department does not have rights or edit facial expressions without switching models.Sensei also will combine imaging and marketing functions so that clients can tweak campaigns on-the-fly, changing tagged features so a night-sky will appear in an ad seen at night, while a day-sky will appear in one seen during the day.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

3 Growth Stocks You Should Avoid in 2017;12/15/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.There's no sugar-coating it: Growth stocks have been the   shining stars over value stocks since the Great Recession ended.   Although aBank of America/Merrill Lynch study found that value stocks have outperformed   growth stocks over the past 90 years with an average annual gain   of 17% versus 12.6%, the low-interest-rate environment over the   past eight years has allowed growth stocks access to cheap and   bountiful capital to rapidly grow their business.But just because low interest rates favor growth stocks, it   doesn't mean you can throw a dart and land a winner. Some growth   stocks are better off avoided in 2017. Here are three such growth   stocks that I'd suggest keeping you distance from next year.makeArticleAd();Tesla MotorsOne high-profile growth stock that I'd strongly suggest   investors leave parked on the sidelines in 2017 is electric   vehicle manufacturerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .This isn't to say Tesla isn't without its positives. Tesla   obliterated Wall Street's earnings estimates in its third-quarter   report, it wound up paying off about $600 million in debt, and   its Model S sedan continues to gain market share. Perhaps most   importantly, Tesla's production levels were a record of 25,185   vehicles, a 92% year-over-year increase and a 37% improvement   from the sequential second quarter. Yet, in spite of an expected   quadrupling in sales between 2015 and 2019, I'd advocate keeping   your distance from Tesla because of three major risks.Tesla Model S. Image source: Tesla Motors.The first risk involves increasing competition. Just a few   years ago, Tesla's Model S was the clear leader in mileage range   and luxury. However, other automakers have made a commitment to   bringing more efficient EVs to market. We're seeing improved   mileage ranges between charges, as well as more power and luxury   withBMW, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz offering new concepts that could   reach the market before the end of the decade. While Tesla's   market share dominance is likely to continue in the near term, it   could begin to be chipped away beyond 2017.Secondly, I'd be concerned about Tesla's ramp-up in spending   which is likely to keep it as a cash-flow negative company for   years to come. No one said building a Gigafactory was going to   cheap, or that expanding its annual production from 100,000   vehicles to 500,000 vehicles was going to go off without a hitch.   But Tesla has also racked up more than $3 billion in debt, even   after paying off $600 million. Its debt-to-equity of 118% further   confirms the weight on the company's shoulders.Lastly, the valuation remains something out of a horror film.   Tesla commands a $34 billion market cap despite only producing   about 100,000 vehicles a year and losing money. Conversely, a   company likeGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) produced 9.8 million vehicles in 2015 and made an   adjusted profit of more than $5 per share. Personally, Tesla   looks like a no-brainer growth stock to avoid in 2017.BioMarin PharmaceuticalAnother growth stock that I don't believe has what it takes to   excel in 2017 is rare-disease drug developerBioMarin Pharmaceutical(NASDAQ: BMRN) .On the surface, BioMarin has a lot to like for longer-term   investors. Its focus on rare-disease drugs means it'll face   minimal competition and that it'll probably have excellent   pricing power if its therapies are approved by the Food and Drug   Administration. BioMarin already has five rare-disease drugs   approved by at least one major regulatory agency around the   world, and all of its therapies focus on ultra-rare diseases.   Between 2015 and 2019, Wall Street is forecasting that BioMarin's   sales will essentially double from a reported $890 million to   approximately $1.8 billion.Image source: Getty Images.However, there are also two drawbacks to BioMarin. To begin   with, incoming president Donald Trump in his latest interview   withTimesuggested that he would lower drug prices in the United States,   which is a point he previously stated on the campaign trail.   Trump's only policy mention related to drug prices, thus far, was   outlined in his seven-point healthcare reform. Within his   proposal, Trump opines that consumers should be able to look   overseas for their medicines, since similar drugs in overseas   markets are typically priced lower than the U.S. It's unclear if   Trump's call for lower drug prices will have any traction in   Congress, but rare disease drugmakers like BioMarin that have   drugs exceeding the $300,000 annual cost barrier are clearly on   Trump's radar.An even more immediate issue could be BioMarin's ongoing   losses. To some extent the company's steep full-year losses can   be forgiven since it's reinvesting back into its pipeline. Then   again, waiting until 2019 to see a full-year profit doesn't seem   worthwhile for a company with a $14 billion market cap when you   can go out and open a position in a number of rare-disease   drugmakers that are already healthfully profitable, such asAlexion PharmaceuticalsorShire.There appear to be far better options in biotech in 2017 than   BioMarin Pharmaceutical.FitbitFinally, investors would probably be wise to step away from   fashionable growth storyFitbit(NYSE: FIT) as we head into 2017.Like the growth stocks above, Fitbit does have positives that   can be taken away. For example, Fitbit announced in its   third-quarter earnings report that new products accounted for an   amazing 79% of its quarterly revenue. Furthermore, total revenue   increased 23% year over year, 60% of its customers were new, and   20% of its customers reactivated after being inactive for 90 or   more days. This would imply strong new traffic to the brand.Image source: Fitbit.But I'll also admit that I was wrong advocating that Fitbitcould be poised for a reboundback in October. Despite heavily reinvesting in its new products,   the launches of those product, and marketing, all Fitbit got out   of it was significantly lower margins and a reduced profit   forecast. There's no denying that revenue rose 23% in Q3 2016   from Q3 2015, but just 11% of that was an increase in units sold.   The remainder was comprised of price increases on its products.   This would suggest that interest in Fitbit's products could be   ebbing, even with a lot of extra money being spent on innovation   and marketing. The company's lowered fourth-quarter guidance   could imply a year-over-year decline in units sold, with a higher   average selling price of those units leading to growth.Fitbit will also need to overcome the stigma of wearable   technology that it's nothing more than a fad. In other words, can   Fitbit get customers to continually upgrade their device in the   same fashion that consumers upgrade their smartphones every year   or two? Based on the data released during the third quarter, it   doesn't look as if Fitbit's products are resonating enough with   existing customers yet. That could change, but I wouldn't look   for 2017 to be the year we see this ramp up in upgrades.Though Fitbit is on track to see its sales climb by more than   50% between 2015 and 2019, I'd suggest keeping your distance from   this growth stock in 2017.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Will Win Big With Waymo;12/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Waymo becomes part of theAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) family of companies, most analysts are asking when or whether it will contribute to GOOG stock's bottom line.Source:Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)The launch event on Dec. 13 featured a blind man given a ride around Austin, Texas ina car without a steering wheel,and vague discussion of how the project's 2 million miles of self-driving experience could be put to work in ride sharing, trucking or public transport.makeArticleAd();While previous GOOG projects like Nest, the automated home company, and Google Fiber, the phone company competitor, quickly floundered as their teams tried to change the world, the car company Waymo seems interested in getting paid for helping others change the world.It's an important distinction. Google X, the unit into which CFO Ruth Porat put CEO Larry Page's ""moonshots"" in technology unrelated to the search engine, is now expected to turn into a real company or go away.A Real Market for GOOGThe new Waymo is being run by a car guy, former Hyundai USA President John Krafcik, leaving the experimental team under Chris Urmson by the side of the road. Urmson islaunching his own startup.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Krafcikis building a team of experienced auto executives, and representing the company in the press, dealing with the fallout from aTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) driver dying with the car in a self-driving mode, the opening of a Waymo design office in Detroit and initial questions of government regulation.These are practical questions previous Alphabet launches tended to ignore. They also tended to ignore whether the opportunity before them was real or in their heads.In the case of Waymo, it's clear there is a real market. Boston Consulting Group estimates it at $42 billion in software and services within 10 years, others say$560 billion in sales within 20.This has attracted real competition, not just from Tesla but from Uber,General Motors Company(NYSE:GM),Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F) and start-ups likenuTonomy.The question for Krafcik is not whether Waymo can knock off these other companies, but where Waymo's experience, software and hardware packages can fit into their plans.Deliberately UndefinedKrafcik is leaving that deliberately undefined. The company has soldFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE:FCAU) on a package that will make100 of its minivansself-driving members of the Waymo fleet.But there are other assets Krafcik can capitalize on, and technical hurdles to be overcome along the way. The lidar ""bucket"" on top of current Google cars costs too much, for instance. The problems of scaling the solution are real ones. Getting the public, politicians and the insurance industry to accept self-driving as a concept is going to be a huge job for the company.Waymo needs to bring in enough cash from what it has already done to fund research into these more specialized areas.Does Apple Inc. (AAPL) REALLY Have an Apple     Watch Problem?For now, Krafcik plans to make Waymo an enabling technology, leaving the heavy capital lifting to others, and making his own efforts self-sustaining.The Bottom Line on GOOG StockThis modest approach will free corporate assets to keep investing in software, in cloud data centers, and in device hardware, which is where CFO Ruth Porat wants the company to be.It should also satisfy shareholders. If Waymo can break even going forward, it will leave GOOG stock's 29.3 price-to-earnings multiple and $554 billion in market cap alone.Since Porat became CFO for what is now Alphabet in June, 2015, GOOG stock is up 49%, the bottom line growing 20% while the top line has grown 10%; it has kept its operating margins at about 25%, and the company will announce revenues of well over $80 billion for the year when it reports 2016 on Jan. 26.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

U.S. Solar Record Installations: The Future is Getting Brighter For Clean Energy;12/15/2016;"According to a new report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy   Industries Association, the third quarter of 2016 was a record   quarter for the U.S. solar industry. 4.14 GW of solar was   installed, nearly as much as all of the solar installed in 2013   (4.76 GW). For all of 2016, the researchers predict 14.1 GW of   solar will be installed, enough to power 2.3 million homes.This is an interesting finding considering the challenges   solar stocks have faced this year.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) have all seen their stocks plunge for a variety of   reasons. And it's those details within the report that are worth   examining.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The biggest solar segment by a long shot77% of all solar installed in the U.S. last quarter was   utility scale, which has helped First Solar and SunPower as two   of the country's largest installers. But we knew late 2016 was   going to be good as developers completed projects contracted to   go online by the end of the year.Image source: GTM Research and Solar Energy Industries   AssociationQ4 2016 Solar Market Insight.An interesting takeaway from the report is that 2017 is   shaping up to be a little better than expected. Corporate   customers are buying energy from solar projects, and a policy   known as PURPA that allows clean energy projects to be built if   they're lower cost than the avoided cost of fossil fuels is   driving adoption.The low cost of utility solar is starting to take hold, and   over the next few years it's the cost advantage that will drive   greater adoption. For now, it's good news that 2016's record year   may not be followed by a completely terrible 2017.Commercial solar is becoming a strengthOne major bright spot was commercial solar, which was up 15%   sequentially and 37% from a year ago. This report includes   community solar in the commercial, or non-residential, segment,   so that helped the growth figures.What's worth pointing out is that commercial customers are   finding solar attractive to purchase and developers are figuring   out ways to finance projects. That's a new trend in 2016, and as   costs come down and financing becomes available we could see a   boom in commercial projects in the same way we saw in residential   solar from 2010 to 2015.Residential solar is having a tough timeSpeaking of residential solar, it's becoming harder and harder   to sell incremental rooftop solar systems, a challenge that led   to a shrinking market in the third quarter. Installations were   down 10% sequentially and 2% from a year ago.There were strengths in new markets like Utah, Texas, and   South Carolina, but big markets like California are actually in   decline. National installers like SolarCity and Vivint Solar are   also dealing with a ""quicker than expected"" customer shift from   leases and power purchase agreements to loans.Despite the decline in residential solar last quarter, this   remains a segment with a lot of potential long-term. A relatively   small number of states -- including California, Massachusetts,   and Arizona -- have long accounted for most rooftop solar demand,   and as more states open up the segment will grow. But it could be   a choppy transition, particularly for companies without flexible   business models to adapt to customer preference.What we learned in Q3 2016Overall, the solar industry is hitting record levels primarily   because of its cost competitiveness in a growing number of   states. And investors should take some comfort in the fact that   demand for utility projects in 2017 is growing and commercial   demand is picking up steam.With that said, the next year or two will be challenging for   residential solar as well as utility demand in some states.   Investors will want to look at the industry cautiously, because   record high demand doesn't mean everyone in the solar industry is   seeing a bright future.10 stocks we like better than Vivint SolarWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Magna International May Soon Build a New Auto Factory;12/14/2016;"Auto-industry supplier and contract manufacturerMagna International(NYSE: MGA) may soon build a new auto factory, a key executive   said this week.Magna's primary business is focused on making components for   the big global automakers. But it also manufactures complete   vehicles: The company's Magna Steyr unit runs an auto factory in   Austria that has made vehicles for several different automakers   over many decades.Apparently, demand is growing for these services -- and that   has implications for all automakers, as well as some companies   that might be looking to enter the auto industry.makeArticleAd();Mercedes-Benz G-Series SUVs roll down the production line at   Magna's contract auto factory in Graz, Austria. Image source:   Magna International.What Magna saidThe head of Magna Steyr's European business, Guenther   Apfalter, told a German trade magazine this week that demand may   be strong enough to warrant construction of a factory near its   existing plant in Graz, Austria.Right now, the Graz plant builds Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUVs   forDaimler AG(NASDAQOTH: DDAIF) . It recently wrapped up production of the   Mini Countryman forBMW AG(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) , and will begin building BMW's 5 Series   starting next spring. Later in the year, it's expected to begin   building the battery-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUV forTata Motors(NYSE: TTM) . Another yet-to-be-announced model from Jaguar Land   Rover is also headed to Graz, possibly in 2018.Apparently, there's demand for even more, and one factory   might not be enough. In a German-languageinterviewwith Germany'sAutomobil Produktion, Apfalter said that the Graz factory is likely to hit its   maximum production capacity by the end of 2018, if not   before.""We are looking at potential locations in Europe, North   America, and China,"" for a new factory, Apfalter said. ""Should   Graz overflow, a new plant nearby would be an option,"" possibly   in Slovenia.He said a decision was likely sometime in the next few   months.Why this is important for the whole auto industryThere are huge contract manufacturers for many things (like   cellphones) in Asia. But auto manufacturing requires hugely   expensive specialized tooling, some of which is specific to a   given model. There are no contract manufacturers for cars --   aside from Magna Steyr.For decades, Magna Steyr has had a profitable business making   vehicles for the big automakers. Sometimes it's a small-volume   model like Mercedes' highly specialized G Series, and sometimes   (as with the BMW 5 Series) Magna provides extra production   capacity to help meet strong demand. The Graz facility can build   internal-combustion, hybrid, and fully electric vehicles.With companies fromAppletoAlphabetto a host of start-ups contemplating various ways to enter the   auto business, demand for contract auto manufacturing could   increase sharply in coming years.Magna's strong hint that it will add a second factory to its   contract-manufacturing operation suggests that it wants to   position itself as an option for those new industry entrants.   That could be very profitable for Magna -- and very helpful to   upstart would-be automakers.The upshot: Another area to watch as the auto industry   evolvesBuilding a new high-volume auto factory from scratch can be a   billion-dollar investment, out of the range of many start-ups and   emerging companies.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) has essentially bootstrapped its factory,   expanding from a small production line as its business (and   income) has grown. But that has been a slow process, and other   potential market entrants might not be willing to wait.For companies that want a high-quality contract manufacturer   for vehicles, Magna Steyr is (right now at least) the only game   in town. Its hints that it will soon invest the considerable sums   needed for a second factory suggest that it knows a lot of new   business is on the way. For those interested in the ongoing   transformation of the auto industry, this is something worth   watching.10 stocks we like better than Magna     InternationalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

General Motors' Chevy Bolt Just Officially Beat Tesla Motors to Market;12/14/2016;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) said that it delivered its first three Chevrolet Bolt   EVs to paying customers on Tuesday, fulfilling a promise made by   CEO Mary Barra that sales of the innovative electric car would   begin by the end of 2016.What GM said about the first Chevy Bolt salesGM said that the first Bolts to be sold at retail were   delivered to three customers at Fremont Chevrolet in Fremont,   California. All three customers had previously owned hybrid or   electric vehicles.makeArticleAd();Bobby Edmonds, William ""Bill"" Mattos, and Steve Henry became   the first three customers to take delivery of new Chevrolet Bolt   EVs in Fremont, California, on Tuesday. Image source: General   Motors.One customer, who purchased a Bolt to replace aBMWi3, said that he was attracted to the electric Chevy by its range   and technology, and by the fact that GM is an American   company.GM executives were understandably pleased. ""All of the hard   work that the Chevrolet team have put into designing, engineering   and building the Bolt EV brings us to this truly satisfying   moment of making the first deliveries to customers on time, as   planned,"" said Alan Batey, president of GM North America and   Chevrolet brand chief. ""Chevrolet is proud to offer a vehicle   like the Bolt EV, with ground-breaking technology wrapped in a   modern design that is also fun to drive at an affordable   price.""For now, GM is building and shipping only a small number of   Chevy BoltsGM is rolling its little electric crossover out slowly,   currently building about 100 Bolts a day, according to an   Automotive News report.GM's factory in Orion, Michigan is reportedly building about   100 Bolts a day. It has the capacity to ramp up significantly if   demand is strong. Image source: General Motors.Shipments are ramping up, too. GM said that more Bolts are   currently in transit to dealers in California and Oregon, set to   arrive before the end of December. Dealers in a few other   markets, including New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia, will   receive their first Bolts sometime this winter.More will be rolled out in the spring, and GM expects the Bolt   to be available at ""Bolt EV-certified"" Chevy dealers nationwide   by about the middle of 2017.GM has a window of opportunity to poach buyers from   TeslaThe Bolt's price tag ($37,495 before a $7,500 federal tax   credit) and range (EPA-estimated at 238 miles) have made it an   appealing alternative to a high-pricedTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S or Model X, at least on paper -- and put   it a big step ahead of mass-market-priced electric vehicles from   other automakers.But the Bolt -- by design -- is very different from the   high-performing and sleekly styled Teslas. The Teslas were   designed to compete head-to-head with German luxury cars, but the   Bolt was created with ride-hailing and car-sharing duties in   mind: It's essentially a 21st century taxicab.The Bolt is a fine choice for someone who wants an electric   commuter car with good acceleration and a roomy back seat, but   nobody will call it sexy like a Model S.That would put the Bolt at a disadvantage (at retail, at   least) if Tesla had a car in the Bolt's price range. That car,   the Tesla Model 3, is in development. Tesla hopes to have it in   production by the end of 2017, though many analysts think mid- to   late 2018 is more realistic. Either way, that gives GM a window   of opportunity.The Bolt isn't a Tesla -- but unlike Tesla's upcoming   ""affordable"" Model 3, it's available now. That gives GM a chance   to poach some buyers from the Silicon Valley automaker.One last thought: The location of the first Bolt EV sales was   no accidentBy the way, I don't think it was a coincidence that the first   Bolts were delivered in Fremont, California. Tesla's factory is   in Fremont, and I think GM enjoys giving its electric rival a   poke in the eye. After all, GM did beat Tesla to market with an   affordable long-range electric car.Don't get too offended, Tesla fans: GM has done this kind of   thing with its crosstown Detroit rivals (and vice-versa) for   decades. Extending it to Tesla is arguably a mark of respect.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Uber Missing the Mark In This Key Area?;12/14/2016;"After deploying some of its ""self-driving"" Uber vehicles in   Pittsburgh in September, the company is now deploying about five   autonomous Volvo XC90 SUVs in San Francisco, Uber announced on   Wednesday. Uber's aggressiveness in testing autonomous technology   highlights the company's vision for a self-driving ride-hailing   service.Uber's self-driving Volvo. Image source: Uber.makeArticleAd();""The promise of self-driving is core to our mission of   reliable transportation, everywhere for everyone,"" Uber   emphasized in a blog post on Wednesday. ""As demand for   ridesharing continues to skyrocket, the future of transportation   will be a mix of human drivers and self-driving cars.""But there are a couple catches to Uber's new ""self-driving""   cars in San Francisco.Are these vehicles really autonomous?""San Francisco, your Self-Driving Uber is arriving now,"" reads   an Uber's Wednesday morning blog post. This bold statement,   however, isn't quite accurate.Later in the same post Uber says, ""For us, it's still early   days and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person   monitoring them."" Like Uber's vehicles deployed in Pittsburgh,   these new ""self-driving"" vehicles require a driver to sit up   front to ensure the ride goes normally. If something goes wrong,   these operators need to take over the wheel.Furthermore, there's a debate about whether Uber even has   permission to operate vehicles like this in San Francisco. The   state of California requires companies testing self-driving   vehicles to obtain a permit to test these vehicles, and Uber   doesn't have one.Going into Uber's launch of its five self-driving vehicles in   San Francisco on Wednesday, the ride-hailing company is aware of   the controversy. Uber acknowledged the issue in its blog post:   ""Finally, we understand that there is a debate over whether or   not we need a testing permit to launch self-driving Ubers in San   Francisco. We have looked at this issue carefully and we don't   believe we do.""California rules don't apply to their situation since the   permit is intended for cars that drive without someone   controlling or monitoring them, according to Uber.But the California DMV disagrees,reportsThe Wall Street Journalon Wednesday. ""Twenty manufacturers have already obtained   permits to test hundreds of cars on California roads. Uber shall   do the same,"" said the DMV.Permit or not, Uber is clearly adamant about pushing the   envelope when it comes to deploying and testing autonomous   technologyTesla's advantage over UberInterestingly, Uber's questionable strategy for testing   autonomous driving technology in Pittsburgh and San Francisco   highlights a major advantage electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , which alsoplans to launch its own self-driving ride-hailing   service, has over Uber.Tesla demonstrated a self-driving Model S. Image source: Tesla   Motors.By beginning toinclude sensors for autonomous driving in every   vehiclein October, Tesla is able to operate its vehicles' new   sensors in ""shadow mode,"" collecting data from every new   vehicle's driving and determining how systems would have   performed in different situations. Not only will this shadow mode   data help Tesla refine its self-driving software before it is   released, but it will also help serve as a benchmark for   regulators to illustrate how the technology can increase safety,   Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said.Therefore, while Uber's San Francisco launch highlights a   debate about regulatory challenges with testing self-driving   technology, the more notable takeaway may be the weakness in   Uber's overall approach. Uber's small number of vehicles for   testing autonomous driving technology in Pittsburgh and San   Francisco pales in comparison to Tesla's current production rate   of 100,000 vehicles annually. Tesla's biggest advantage over Uber   in preparing to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service may be   its ability to generate far more data from self-driving   sensors.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Best Stocks for 2017: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Soaring;12/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsEditor's note: This column is part of our Best Stocks for     2017 contest. Louis Navellier's pick for the contest isNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Self-driving cars. Virtual reality headsets. Artificial   intelligence. The past year has brought incredible advances in   technologies that defied the imagination not too long ago. My   best stocks for 2017 pick is at the forefront of these   fast-growing technologies - and is profiting handsomely from   them.makeArticleAd();Nvidia Corporation(NASSDAQ:NVDA) is a leading computer graphics company, making graphic   processing units (GPUs) for consumers and businesses. From video   games to professional visualization, datacenter and automotive   applications, Nvidia's graphics cards enhance the processing   capability of its users' computers.The company has been in the computer graphics business for   more than two decades - it invented the GPU in 1999 - so it is a   well-established player. To date, Nvidia owns 7,300 patents   relating to computer graphics, the largest portfolio of its   kind.NVDA Stock Powering UpWhile NVDA stock got its start as a graphics card company that   catered to video game enthusiasts, it turns out that the GPU has   a wide range of powerful applications. Graphics cards can be used   to aid computers in applications like financial modeling, oil and   gas exploration, virtual reality and even in self-driving   cars.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017To that last point, Nvidia currently has partnerships with   many leading automakers, includingAudi,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Mercedes-Benz,Volvo,Honda Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:HMC) andBMW.

Alphabet Inc.'s Self-Driving Car Project Becomes a Company, Gets a Name;12/14/2016;"Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google self-driving car project   is no longer just a project. Starting today, the tech company's   self-driving car efforts have graduated from the Google X   research unit, as one of Alphabet's ""moonshots,"" to an official   Alphabet business called Waymo.Self-driving car. Image source: Waymo.makeArticleAd();""Waymo stands for a new way forward in mobility. We're a   self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe   and easy for people and things to move around,"" Waymo said in a   blog post on Tuesday.Alphabet's launch of Waymo comes nearly eight years after the   company began working on self-driving cars, but it enters what is   quickly turning into a fiercely competitive market asTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) asserts it isalready including self-driving sensors in every   vehicleand as other auto manufacturers, tech companies, and ride-hailing   services explore ways to monetize the nascent technology.Meet WaymoWaymo was careful to emphasize that this is not the beginning   of Alphabet's efforts in this important space, but rather the   culmination of years of work.""Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced   self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,""   said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in the company's blog   post.Waymo technology. Image source: Waymo.Alphabet knew it was time for Waymo to begin the process of   becoming its own company when the former Google X project   completed ""the world's first fully self driven car ride"" in late   2015, Krafcik said. Navigating through Austin's suburbs with   legally blind passenger Steve Mahan, Alphabet says the drive   reflected everyday driving situations.Mahan explained the importance of this milestone:The ability to complete a fully self-driven trip on everyday     public roads, with no test driver, was a big milestone for our     team and the history of this technology. It was the signal that     we could begin to shift our focus from foundational technical     work toward launching our own company so we can offer many more     rides, in more places, for more people.Self-driving technology -- not self-driving     carsInterestingly, in conjunction with the announcement of Waymo   today, Alphabet is reportedly backing off any plans to   manufacture and sell its own self-driving cars, opting instead to   partner with auto manufacturers in order to deploy the   technology, according toThe Information's Amir Efrati.Alphabet has backed off plans to develop a revolutionary car     without a steering wheel or pedals, at least for now, according     to people close to the closely watched project. Instead, the     self-driving car pioneer has settled on a more practical effort     to partner with automakers to make a vehicle that drives itself     but has traditional features for human drivers.And a comment from Waymo's Krafcik during a press conference   on Tuesday seems to confirm the new company's choice to abstain   from auto manufacturing for now. ""We've been really clear that   we're not a car company,"" Krafcik said (viaThe New York Times). ""We're not in the business of making better cars. We're in the   business of making better drivers.""Tesla recently released a video of a Model S driving itself.   Image source: Tesla Motors.Alphabet's decision to refrain from manufacturing its own   self-driving vehicles differs from Tesla's emphasis on both the   self-driving technology and the manufacturing of self-driving   vehicles and it means Tesla doesn't have to worry about the   technology giant becoming a direct competitor -- for now.   However, it's worth noting it was never certain Alphabet ever   intended on manufacturing its own vehicles in the first   place.Given how competitive and capital intensive the auto market   is, focusing solely on the self-driving technology may arguably   be the better move for software-centric Alphabet's Waymo. Indeed,   Waymo isn't the only major company to acknowledge the challenge   ambitious manufacturing plans could bring about. By focusing on   the autonomous driving software instead of building self-driving   cars, Alphabet's Waymo vision mimics a recent report thatApplehas also shifted its focus from building its own self-driving car   to emphasizing the development of the underlying technology for   autonomous driving.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Yellen, Trump and Tech: Will They Help Dow Hit 20K?;12/14/2016;"Wednesday, December 13, 2016makeArticleAd();Ahead of the opening bell this morning, the Producer Price Index (PPI) - a key inflation metric - for November looks to be running hot at +0.4%, both as the headline number and after stripping out (more volatile) food and energy costs. No revisions were made to the October headline, and year over year PPI ex-food & energy is +1.6%.Count this as another arrow in the quiver of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which announces interest rate policy later today, to raise interest rates 25 basis points. No surprise here; unless Fed Chair Janet Yellen announces a more than quarter-point hike at her press conference this afternoon, the market should be conducting business as usual - after parsing Yellen's language regarding FOMC policy into 2017.Retail Sales, on the other hand - another economic report issued ahead of today's market open - was light compared to expectations, only reaching +0.1%. This number rises to +0.2% ex-auto sales, but still light on this other key inflation metric.With the shakeup at Goldman SachsGS, where COO Gary Cohn is leaving to become President-elect Trump's chief economic advisor, David Solomon and Harvey Schwartz will step up to co-COO positions at the firm, which looks to have CEO Lloyd Blankfein in charge for the foreseeable future. Speaking of Trump organization, the President-elect's Strategic & Policy Forum now has three new members: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, TeslaTSLAand SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and PepsicoPEPCEO Indra Nooyi.Further, today is the day major tech leaders - Musk, GoogleGOOGLco-founder Larry Page, MicrosoftMSFTCEO Satya Nadella and AppleAAPLCEO Tim Cook among them - meet at Trump Tower with the President-elect to discuss policy shifts. This looks to be pretty juicy: with Trump's known animosity toward trade practices with China - both the U.S.'s biggest trade partner and biggest tech market - a fly on the wall at this meeting would be highly valuable.

Can Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Keep This Fire Burning?;12/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicroprocessor firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) has nearly tripled so far this year. Investors are growing increasingly enthusiastic that its transformation from a purely graphics chip firm to a purveyor of graphics processing units (GPUs) will send sales and cash flow - and as a result, NVDA stock - significantly higher in the coming years.makeArticleAd();Source:via NvidiaBased off the run in Nvidia shares, the company is already a bona fide success. But most of the run has come on an expansion of NVDA's earnings multiple. That said, earnings expectations have run 32% higher - from $1.84 per share to $2.42 per share - over the past 90 days. That's pretty solid earnings momentum.The key question for prospective investors: Will the momentum in fundamentals continue? Based off current valuations, significant growth already is priced into NVDA stock. That could leave a lot of room for disappointment.On the flip side, the markets that Nvidia is actively targeting are arguably in a revolutionary stage.A Look at Nvidia's Recent ResultsRevenue for Nvidia's third quarter jumped 53.5% to $2 billion. Management called it a ""breakout"" quarter where revenue and earnings hit records. Net income jumped to $570 million, or 94 cents per share of NVDA stock.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Growth was strongest in selling chips and related systems that power video games, datacenters run by the likes ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and a burgeoning automotive market.Nvidia's most important segment is gaming. Customers in this segment includeSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) and its PlayStation franchise. The company mentioned games including Battlefield 1, Call of Duty, and eSports for deploying its Pascal-based graphics processing units (GPUs). Annual gaming growth has been stellar at 30% annually over the last three years.Gaming sales increased 63% and exceeded $1 billion to account for more than half of total revenue. Professional visualization is the next largest unit but only saw a modest increase to $207 million in quarterly sales. This unit provides chips for a mix of industries, including media and entertainment.Automotive sales jumped 61%, but at $127 million are still a small percent of the total pie (6%). The auto segment has huge upside potential because of excitement surrounding development of self-driving cars.Nvidia's Growth DriversNvidia serves huge markets that continue to grow. It estimates the gaming market at $100 billion and its market share at only 3.5%.Automotive represents a total market over $10 trillion. Nvidia is fast positioning itself as the chip provider of choice to automotive companies. Its systems are already present in more than 10 million vehicles around the world. During its earnings conference call, it detailed thatTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)is powering its autonomous car system with its Nvidia Drive PX 2 that are more than 40 times faster than earlier technologies.The datacenter segment is another growth avenue. NVDA partners withVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW) and Citrix in this market. So far this year, growth is running at 121% to represent the fastest growth market for the company. Its datacenter GPU also happens to be known as Tesla, and it has been used in scientific applications to help improve heart surgery and mapping of the human genome.Artificial intelligence also is turning out to be a huge growth avenue. Nvidia defines AI as the use of computers to recreate human thinking and intelligence. This covers deep learning frameworks, such as big data applications that collect and track information on servers and cloud-based networks. It also covers self-driving cars where AI technology drives an automobile and helps steer it clear from accidents.Bottom Line for NVDA StockNvidia is ambitiously pursuing growth in gaming, automotive, as well as artificial intelligence applications. Based off total expected revenue growth of 37% to nearly $7 billion for this year, the potential appears to be great.Nothing Will Save Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock. Nothing.Unfortunately for prospective investors in NVDA stock, the share price has continued to move upward and may have run ahead of what is supported by the fundamentals. The profit expectation for this year is $2.42 per share. The stock is currently trading at 38X these estimates.This doesn't mean that investors should avoid the stock completely. Keep an eye on the earnings trend - if it continues to move upward, the stock should continue to move upward. The chip business is also cyclical - an overall downturn in the industry could knock Nvidia stock down too.Looking at Nvidia's past results could also deceive investors. Sales had been stuck in the $4 billion range for the better part of a decade. That ticked up slightly over the last couple of years, and appears to be building steam.Given the vastness and growth potential of the current markets being served, the upside  in NVDA stock is appealing.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in of the other aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017The 10 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The postCan Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Keep This Fire Burning?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

General Motors' All-Electric Chevrolet Bolt Deliveries Begin;12/13/2016;"Living up to its promise,General Motors(NYSE: GM) delivered the first affordable fully electric vehicle   with over 200 miles today. Perhaps in a move to rub it in, the   Chevrolet Bolt was delivered in the same city in which   electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) builds its vehicles: Fremont, California.Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors.makeArticleAd();Here they come""All of the hard work that the Chevrolet team have put into   designing, engineering and building the Bolt EV brings us to this   truly satisfying moment of making the first deliveries to   customers on-time, as planned,"" said GM North America president   Alan Batey in a company press release announcing the first three   deliveries of its Bolt, which boasts 238 miles or EPA-rated range   on a single charge and an impressive $37,500 price tag. ""Only   Chevrolet is able to offer a vehicle like the Bolt EV,"" Batey   boasted, ""with ground-breaking technology wrapped in a modern   design that is also fun-to-drive at an affordable price.""The first three deliveries went to customers in California   cities Fremont, Castro Valley, and Portola Valley.""The range and technology attracted me to the Bolt EV,"" said   Castro Valley's Bobby Edmonds. ""It's also a great-looking, roomy   vehicle, and I love the fact it's from an American brand. I look   forward to the longer drives I can make compared to the i3 that I   owned.""Though GM is living up to its promise by beginning Bolt   deliveries before the end of the year, investors should note that   the vehicle will only be available in limited quantities. Beyond   initial deliveries in California, Bolt deliveries will make their   way to ""a number of Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States including   New York, Massachusetts and Virginia"" this winter, General Motors   said. And the vehicle will hit ""additional major metro markets""   during the first half of next year, with nationwide availability   at ""Bolt EV-certified dealerships"" in mid-2017.General Motors' reportedly plans to producearound 20,000 to 50,000 Bolt units next year.An important milestoneWhile General Motors' Chevrolet Bolt is unlikely to have any   meaningful impact on the company's financial results in the near   future, investors still shouldn't underestimate the importance of   the first Bolt deliveries. The Bolt is a notable achievement for   a number of reasons, including:The Bolt's 238 miles range on a single charge makes it the     first electric vehicle to have comparable range to Tesla     vehicles. Further, the range is higher than the 215-plus miles     Tesla has promised for its upcoming $35,000 Model 3.The Bolt's price is even more noteworthy; at $37,500, the     vehicle has more range than the base Tesla Model S' 218 miles     of EPA-rated range and costs 45% less than the luxury     sedan.It signals General Motors' commitment to long-range     electric vehicles. With sales of long-range EVs growing at 50%     annually and expected to continue growing at this rate for     years to come, General Motors is dipping its toes in a     promising market.It shows General Motors won't let Tesla launch its Model 3     without a fight.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Setting apart its more ambitious vision for electric vehicle   production, Tesla plans to begin delivering Model 3 during the   second half of 2017 and expects to achieve volume deliveries   before 2017 is over. Further, Tesla expects Model 3 will help   take the company's annualized production from a build rate of   100,000 units today to 500,000 in 2018.Of course, investors shouldn't discount General Motors' Bolt   production just because the company isn't aiming for the same   delivery volume as Tesla is with its Model 3. Tesla's plans   remain targets while GM's Bolt is already in the hands of   customers.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Electric Minivan Could Be a Hit;12/13/2016;"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) plans to unveil a fully electric vehicle based on   the Chrysler Pacifica minivan at the Consumer Electronics Show   (CES) in Las Vegas next month, according to a Bloombergreport.FCA is also working on a battery-electric Maserati sports car   that will aim to compete with the premium electrics fromTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , the report said.makeArticleAd();The stylish Chrysler Pacifica Minivan is already available as   a plug-in hybrid. Is a fully electric version the next step?   Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.What do we know about the new electric Pacifica?We don't know much. Officially, FCA hasn't said anything at   all, and the Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed ""people   familiar with the plans,"" was short on details.But we can draw some conclusions from the fact that it will   reportedly be based on the Pacifica, rather than on a small car   or crossover. For starters, it seems likely that the choice of   the Pacifica, and the decision to unveil the new electric at CES,   are signals that this new electric model will be more than a   so-called ""compliance car.""What's a ""compliance car""?Battery-electric vehicles that were developed from models   originally designed for internal combustion, likeFord'sFocus Electric and FCA's own Fiat 500e, are often (and somewhat   derisively) referred to as ""compliance cars.""Vehicles like these tend to have ranges of around 100 miles   (or less) compromises in their packaging (batteries filling much   of the former trunk, for instance), and high prices. Enthusiasts   argue that they seem less about drawing eager customers and more   about satisfying a regulatory requirement as cheaply as   possible.Why should we think the electric Pacifica will be more than   that?Well, first of all, FCA already has a compliance car, the   aforementioned Fiat 500e. It doesn't need another.But there are other reasons why FCA might have chosen the   Pacifica as the basis for its first longer-range EV. The Pacifica   is a new design that is already available in a plug-in hybrid   version. That plug-in Pacifica is a technologically advanced   vehicle -- enough so that it waschosen as a test platformforAlphabet's Google Self-Driving Car Project.But more to the point, the plug-in hybrid drivetrain was part   of the Pacifica's engineering from the start, not tacked on   later. As you can see from the cutaway illustration below, the   hybrid battery pack is below the van's floor. It doesn't take too   much imagination to visualize a larger battery pack in the same   general location, especially if the gasoline engine is   replaced by a much smaller electric motor.Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.It's very possible that the Pacifica was engineered from the   start with the possibility of a larger battery pack in mind, one   that would give an electric Pacifica a range of 200 miles or   so.An electric minivan with good range and a mass-market price   would be an intriguing product. Fold in the Pacifica's unusually   (for a minivan) stylish good looks, and it could catch on as an   affordable alternative to Tesla's Model X for green-minded   families that need a big kid-hauler.What about that electric Maserati?Back in 2014, FCA's Maserati brand showed a prototype of a   sleek high-performance coupe called the Alfieri. A production   version is expected to arrive around 2019, and there have been   strong hints from the company that an all-electric Alfieri will   follow about a year later.A production version of 2014's Maserati Alfieri concept car is   expected to arrive in 2019. An electric version could arrive a   year or so later. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.As with everything having to do with FCA, particularly when it   comes to the Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, it's very possible   that schedules will slip and products will be delayed or changed.   But the industry rumor mill strongly suggests that the company's   current plan is to deliver an electric coupe that will probably   look very similar to the show car pictured above.What would this mean for Fiat Chrysler?It's a big shift for FCA. CEO Sergio Marchionne has said   repeatedly that he thinks it will be years before battery costs   fall to the point where electric cars make business sense.But despite that concern, he said in June that he wanted FCA   to experiment more with electric drivetrains. He has recently   pushed FCA to more aggressively embrace other advancing   technologies, including partnerships with potentially disruptive   Silicon Valley giants.In addition to partnering with Google on self-driving, FCA is   also working withAmazon.comon a pilot program tosell cars directly to customers online. It's possible that we will learn in January that FCA has found   one or more partners to help speed its electric-car development   as well.What's next for FCA's electric-vehicle effort?Again, it's hard to say until we have a better idea of what   the company is planning. We should know much more after FCA makes   its presentation at CES on Jan. 3.10 stocks we like better than Fiat Chrysler     AutomobilesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tech and Trump: Can They Find Common Ground in New York?;12/13/2016;"Tomorrow, all eyes will be on New York City's Trump Tower as President-Elect Donald Trump sits down with Silicon Valley's top tech leaders. While the meeting's agenda has yet to be disclosed, it is safe to assume themes like job creation, immigration, regulation, and encryption will all be likely discussion topics.It's been well documented that the vast majority of Silicon Valley leaders opposed Trump during the presidential election, with some helping and fund-raising for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during her campaign. The Obama administration has acted largely favorable towards large tech corporations over the years, from its ""net-neutrality"" policy-which requires internet providers to treat all web traffic equally-to its hands-off tactics to the tech industry's growing concentration of power.Joining Trump on his side of the table will be Reince Preibus, his chief of staff, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and key transition team member Peter Thiel, a tech investor who was one of the few Silicon Valley names to support Mr. Trump.Expected tech executives include:AppleAAPLChief Executive Tim CookFacebookFBChief Operating Officer andLean Inauthor Sheryl SandbergMicrosoftMSFTCEO Satya NadellaAmazonAMZNCEO andThe Washington Postowner Jeff BezosTesla MotorsTSLACEO Elon MuskAlphabetGOOGLCEO and Chairman Larry Page and Eric SchmidtIntelINTCCEO Brian KrzanichIBMIBMCEO Ginni RomettyOracleORCLco-CEO Safra CatzCiscoCSCOCEO Chuck RobbinsSurprisingly, TwitterTWTRCEO Jack Dorsey will not be present at the meeting, given how much Mr. Trump prefers the social networking platform over others.Many of these tech companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, saw theirshares slidethe day after the election on worries that a Trump presidency would negatively affect their manufacturing and product distribution methods here in the U.S. and especially abroad.One area of common ground, however, could be tax reform. According to theWall Street Journal, the president-elect is ""expected to promote corporate tax reform, which, depending on the details, could enable U.S. tech companies to bring home hundreds of billions of dollars they currently hold offshore.""The meeting is set for 2:00pm on Wednesday afternoon, and the world will be watching, waiting to learn all the minute details, hoping for, at least, some agreement on key issues, and realizing that the tech industry and Mr. Trump may need more from each other than either is willing to give.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Why Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) Stock Could Blast Off in 2017;12/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSirius XM Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ:SIRI) has had a pretty good year in terms of stock price. SIRI stock has improved by more than year-to-date and roughly 36% since its February low. Shares even hit a 10-year high in November.Source:Vinod Sankar via FlickrWith the 2016 remaining just a few weeks, it's almost certain that SIRI stock will record a positive year altogether, barring any late market fiasco, of course.makeArticleAd();The question now is if Sirius XM Radio shares can enjoy another (or an even more) stellar year in 2017.I think the answer is a resounding ""yes.""The State of SIRI StockSirius XM literally owns the satellite radio market. As of the end of the third quarter, SIRI had more than 31 million subscribers compared to just under 29 million a year ago. Impressively, the company has reported 28 consecutive profitable quarters as of the third quarter. Sirius XM also has been pretty consistent in growing revenues over the past decade.However, the investment community isn't particularly upbeat about the future of SIRI stock. The worry? That satellite radio is atransitory technologyat risk of becoming obsolete. The smartphone revolution as well as the growing popularity of connected cars instills the belief that internet radio - not satellite radio - is the future.Merger With PandoraCNBC reported that internet radio giantPandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) is open to an acquisition by Sirius XM. This is something of a reversal, asPandora reportedly rejected a $15-per-share offerfrom SIRI earlier in the year.5 Tech Stocks That Should Top Your 2016     Christmas Wish ListIf the two do pair up, it's likely to be announced in 2017. Such a merger will effectively reduce fears that Sirius XM is going away sometime soon, as it will address the oncoming force of Internet radio by … well, joining it.As RBC analystMark Mahaneysaid, this would allow Sirius XM to diversify its revenue streams as well as customer base. Sirius currently depends on subscription for its revenue; Pandora's sales come primarily on ad dollars.Moreover, having access to Pandora's customers would give SIRI stock an avenue for upsells. Not to mention, a Sirius XM-Pandora merger would likely increase the combined appeal of the joined companies to advertisers.The potential for revenue growth in this prospective deal is wide and considerable.Don't Count Out a Sirius XM Video App, EitherWhen Howard Stern signed a new contract with Sirius XM last year, the company also announced a possible video-as-a-platform initiative. While SIRI execs haven't been forthcoming regarding the details of the video service, Stern was upbeat.Sirius' James Meyer said during the third quarter earnings call that the company had signed an agreement withWhalerockto plot a path for how SIRI can use video to improve its services over the long-term. He hinted that the video service would launch next year.It's unclear whether Sirius is planning to monetize the video content based on its traditional subscription model. We'll have to wait until the service launches. If SIRI takes the route of making its video content available on subscription, it's difficult to see how it'll yield any significant growth for the company. The internet is littered with tons of free video services already. Not many folks will be willing to pay for it, except the service somehow comes bundled with the usual sat-rad subscription.The smarter route to take would be using the video content to simply grow Sirius XM's popularity, thereby, allowing for improved organic growth of its radio business. Again, we'll have to wait to see the path the company takes.The Latest Apple Inc. (AAPL) Delay: BeatsX     EarbudsSo SIRI stock holders should keep an eye out for developments on this front, too.Bottom Line on Sirius XMIf Sirius XM can pull off either of the above catalysts, expect 2017 to be another stellar year for SIRI stock.Also, I think the fear regarding the future of Sirius' satellite radio business is blown out of proportion. The company keeps growing its subscriber base too fast for a company that's at risk of obsolescence.A freshly minted dividend also should give shareholders more confidence in the company's financial standing.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceDoes Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Belong in     Your IRA?Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

The President-elect had threatened to force technology companies like Apple to bring their overseas manufacturing operations back to the U.S.Moreover, Trump's views over antitrust enforcement, trade protectionism, immigration policy (particularly issuance of H1B visas used to hire skilled foreigners) and net-neutrality (Donald Trump is known as a criticizer of this policy) are some of the major headwinds for the U.S. technology companies like IBM, Alphabet and NetflixNFLX.Another concern is Trump's determination to cut clean energy spending. Most of the big technology companies have been moving toward clean energy with the help of government tax breaks. Any spending cut will certainly be a dampener on these plans.Computer and Technology Sector Price IndexComputer and Technology Sector Price IndexTechnology Sector and Donald Trump - Common GroundDespite the verbal volleys and pre-election enmity, it is now quite clear that none of them - Donald Trump nor the Silicon Valley bigwigs - can ignore each other. For the sake of smooth running of their businesses as well as the U.S. economy, a ""common ground"" is necessary as observed by the Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant.Corporate tax reform that has been blatantly advocated by the President-elect since early days of his campaign is an issue that can bring technology leaders and Donald Trump to a truce.Per data from Moody's Investors Service Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle together made up almost 30% ($504 billion) of the $1.7 trillion in cash and cash equivalents held by U.S. non-financial companies in 2015. According to figures from the WSJ: ""Apple alone holds about 91% of its $237.6 billion in cash offshore.""Notably, the U.S. government currently levies a 35% tax rate on repatriated cash, which Trump has promised to lower to 15%. An ideal restructuring of tax rates will enable companies like Apple to bring back a major part of their offshore cash to the U.S.Will Technology Stocks Rebound?Since Donald Trump's selection (Nov 9), we note that the Zacks Computer & Technology industry has returned a modest 2.12% as compared with S&P 500 Composite's gain of 4.22%.

Tesla's Price Target Slashed: What You Need to Know;12/12/2016;"Monday is opening on a down note forTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) investors.This morning, analysts at Deutsche Bank announced they   are resuming coverage onTesla stock. That's the good news. The bad news is that Deutsche doesn't   really like what it sees. According to the analyst, the stock   that has lost 12% of its value over the past year might rebound   slightly in 2017 -- but not nearly so much as we once hoped.   Deutsche is reducing its price target on Tesla stock from $290 to   just $215. And while this new target is about 12% above where   Tesla shares sit today, Deutsche is only rating Tesla stock hold   -- not buy.makeArticleAd();Here are three things you need to know about why.Tesla is re-envisioning the electric car with its Model 3 sedan.   Image source: Getty Images.1. Challenging assumptionsTesla has famously boasted that it expects toramp vehicle production to 500,000 unitsannually -- most of them budget-model Model 3 sedans -- by 2018.   Previously, Deutsche took that promise on faith, and built a   valuation model on Tesla stock that assumed the company would hit   its 2018 goal, then go on to produce as many as 650,000 Model 3s   annually by 2020 -- but now, Deutsche's not so sure.According to a write-up onStreetInsider.comthis morning, Deutsche still believes that ""EV growth will   surprise as costs converge with ICEs."" But the analyst is pulling   back from its previous prediction of 650,000 units sold in 2020,   and now predicts Tesla will sell only 450,000 Model 3s that   year.2. Trust, but verifyMind you, Deutsche's new estimate doesn't necessarily mean   that Elon Musk's estimate is wrong. If Tesla were to produce   450,000 Model 3s in 2020 (as Deutsche now predicts), and produces   a few more Model S units, Model X units, and perhaps a handful of   redesigned Roadsters -- it could still reach Musk's goal of   500,000 total electric cars produced in 2018, 2019, and 2020, as   well. All Deutsche is saying is that it's decided to build   ""additional conservatism into our assumptions for the Model 3   ramp.""Even so, Deutsche's new estimate implies less free cash flow   being generated by Tesla. And based on this, the analyst is   cutting its ""discounted cash flow derived"" target on Tesla's cars   business, yielding an implied price target of $214 on this half   of the company, instead of the previous target of $290.3. What about the rest of Tesla?If you've noticed by now that $214 is not the same thing as   $215, then kudos for paying attention. Here's how Deutsche   explains that tiny disconnect: The final piece of the Tesla   puzzle is SolarCity, the solar power business that   Teslaacquiredlast month. Many investorsopposed this moveby Tesla when it was first announced. Surprisingly, Deutsche is   not one of them.As detailed in its report, Deutsche believes that   Tesla-qua-Tesla is worth $214 today, based on where the analyst   thinks it will be in 2020. The analyst proceeds to discount that   value by $14 based on an assumption that Tesla willdilute its stockholderswith additional share issuances to cover a $2.5 billion shortfall   in cash requirements between now and 2020. This brings the value   of Tesla's car business down to $200. What takes it up again to$215is the value of adding SolarCity to the mix.Albeit Deutsche doesn't think SolarCity is worth the $20.45   that its shares ended up selling for, it does admit that ""with   SCTY we derive a target of $215"" -- $200 for the cars business,   and another $15 for SolarCity.The most important thing: SkepticismEven after all this math and even after convincingitselfthat Tesla stock is worth 12% more than it currently costs,   Deutsche Bank still cannot bring itself to recommend that anyone   actually buy Tesla shares. I think that's a prudent call.As Deutsche's recommendation demonstrates, valuing Tesla today   requires a lot of assumptions -- about the rate at which Tesla   can ramp electric car production, about the car-buying public's   willingness to switch from gasoline-powered automobiles to   electrics, and about Tesla's need to dilute shareholders with   additional share issuances en route to an eventually profitable   future. Meanwhile, Tesla continues to lose money ($874 million   over the past 12 months, according to data fromS&P   Global Market Intelligence) and burn cash ($876 million in negative free cash flow).Until those facts change, Tesla remains a speculative   stock.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Does Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Belong in Your IRA?;12/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA couple of years ago I wrote an article forInvestorPlacethat pittedTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) againstApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) in the ultimate battle of tech darlings. Tesla stock or Apple stock? Which stock should investors entrust their hard-earned money to?Source: TeslaNot an easy decision,thenor now.makeArticleAd();In hindsight, the quick answer to that question is Apple, whose stock has appreciated 16.3% over the past 26 months compared to a 32.8% decline in the TSLA stock price. It's ironic, though, given that Tesla's recent quarters have seen some of its best financial numbers in the company's history, while Apple is mired in sales declines.Why is Tesla stock reversing its field? Why is the world round? There are so many reasons it has gone into a funk the closer it has gotten to actual profitability.A Few Reasons for CautionStill,InvestorPlacefeature writer James Brumley recently provided several reasonswhy it makes sense to wait and see what happens with Teslabefore investors pile on the next leg up to financial immortality.The Best Investments for 2017Specifically, Brumley mentioned three things to consider before buying TSLA stock:Has Elon Musk bitten off more than Tesla can chew with itsSolarCity Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY) acquisition? Does it really need this distraction as pushes   toward profitability? TSLA's downward trend says investors think   not.Can Tesla get the cost of producing a vehicle in the vicinity   of its gas-powered peers? Industry experts say it costs Tesla   $81,000 to produce a single vehicle. Hedge fund manager Mark   Spiegel reckons with economies of scale and the use of steel   instead of aluminum, Tesla could drop that number to $48,000, 27%   higher than the suggested price of its new, supposedly affordable   Model 3.Competitors likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) are purposely ramping up their electric carproductionso they can offset the great fuel consumption of the Chevy Bolt   and Volt against their bigger SUV gas guzzlers.If the market for electric vehicles expands beyond the 2% to 3% of total vehicles produced every year, the consensus is that Tesla won't be able to keep up.Look,I'm a fan of Elon Musk. It's not Donald Trump who will make America great. It's brilliantly passionate people like the Tesla CEO who will - hands down.""In keeping with a fast-growing technology company, all free cash flow is plowed back into R&D to drive down the costs and bring the following products to market as fast as possible,"" Elon Muskwrotein 2006. ""When someone buys the Tesla Roadster sports car, they are actually helping pay for the development of the low-cost family car.""Brilliant.That said, Tesla is probably not the best stock to have in your 401k or IRA - if you're retiring anytime soon.Tesla Stock Definitely Isn't a Retirement Pick NowHere's what I said in 2014:""I'd suggest you buy an ETF that holds Apple and/or Tesla stock if you're 10 years or less from retirement. If you're between 10 and 20 years to retirement, I'd go with AAPL stock. And if you're 20 or more away from hanging them up, I'd go with Tesla stock.""Nothing's changed in my opinion.Assuming an average retirement age of 65, I'm comfortable recommending that investors 45 or younger seriously consider TSLA stock for their retirement accounts. Of course, many 401k plans - which most people have - either don't allow individual stocks or make it cost prohibitive.If you have a 401k, where it makes sense, buy Tesla, and if it continues to go lower, you've got loads of time for it to recover. And if you can't put it in your 401k, consider putting it into an IRA instead.There's only one caveat.Chesapeake Energy (CHK) Stock Is the Right Way     to Play OPECMake sure TSLA stock represents no more than 5% of the overall market value of your plan, regardless of the type. Besides, your equity funds or ETFs held in the plan will likely own TSLA stock as well, so there's no need to overdo it.Is there risk investing in Tesla stock?Absolutely, there is. But if you diversify appropriately, in 20 years, it won't matter if Tesla ultimately goes broke.I say put TSLA in your retirement accounts, but only if you're prepared to wait.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Gold Stocks to Short Into the Dirt4 Energy Stocks to Gain from Trump's Preferred     EPA ChiefThe 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 2017The postDoes Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Belong in Your IRA?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

NVIDIA (NVDA) to Move Further into Autonomous Car Market;12/12/2016;"Over the last few years,NVIDIA CorporationNVDAhas been putting in a lot of effort to strengthen its position in several emerging industries. Apart from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning, the company is working hard to establish itself in the driverless cars industry, and yes, its efforts have been rather impressive.Most recently, NVIDIA achieved another milestone in this space after the California Department of Motor Vehicles (CDMV) granted it a permit for testing self-driving vehicle technology on public roads for the first time.It should be noted that California has been a hotbed for autonomous testing since 2014, as it was the first state that established regulations for self-driving vehicles on its public roads. Since then, various companies including Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand Tesla MotorsTSLAhave been cleared by CDMV to test their driverless cars.Notably, since 2015, NVIDIA has been providing various autonomous technologies such as digital instrument clusters, navigation, advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment under its partnerships with several automakers including HondaHMC, Tesla Motors, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.Therefore, we believe that the recent permit to test its driverless cars will encourage various other auto manufacturers to use NVIDIA's processing units in their autonomous driving systems.NVIDIA's Journey in the Driverless Cars SpaceNVIDIA forayed into autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronics space in 2015 by launching a computer vision system at the Consumer Electronics Show. It hasn't looked back since then and has been continuously bringing new and more advanced technologies in the space.At the beginning of this year, NVIDIA launched DRIVE PX 2 - the world's most powerful engine for in-vehicle AI. The company's Drive PX 2 computer chip for self-driving cars is considered to be as powerful as 150 MacBook Pros, and has the capacity to power 12 video camera inputs and sensor fusion. The chip, according to NVIDIA, can run about 24 trillion deep learning operations per second, thereby enabling driverless cars to determine the next move in a fraction of a second.In Sep 2016, the graphic chip behemoth unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Amsterdam. Xavier is a system-on-chip (SoC), which is built with an 8-core ARM64-based CPU and a next generation 512 core NVIDIA GPU. The chip also integrates a new computer vision accelerator.As per the company, the processor is capable of delivering 20 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance, while consuming just 20 watts of power. The company anticipates making the processor available to automakers and other groups developing self-driving cars during the fourth quarter of 2017.Huge Growth Potential of the IndustryAccording to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.These estimates encourage us about NVIDIA's growth prospects in the space. With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced technologies for self-diving cars, we believe that the company is well poised to capitalize on this opportunity.Bottom LineNVIDIA continues to be the world's biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs since the past several decades. The company's efforts toward autonomous vehicle segment indicate that it intends to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too. Furthermore, by expanding its business avenues, the company will be able to reduce its dependency on the PC industry, which is currently declining.It should be noted that during the last reported quarterly results, the company witnessed a 61% year-over-year jump in automotive segment revenues, mainly driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars.The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of 2016 and has gained approximately 179% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor-General industry return of just about 30%.The stock has grabbed the spotlight with striking performances on the back of solid earnings results and strong growth projections. Keeping this in mind, we believe investing in this stock would yield strong returns for your portfolio in the short term.Currently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Can Intel Challenge NVIDIA in the Self-Driving Car Space?;12/9/2016;"Intel Corporation'sINTCrecent deal wins is anticipated to strengthen its footprint and improve its competitive position against NVIDIANVDAin the self-driving car market. The company recently created a new division called Automated Driving Group (ADG), which focuses on this fast-emerging market.makeArticleAd();Per Intel, the company has already won self-driving car deals worth $1 billion this year. Most prominent among them is the partnership with German carmaker BMW and Mobileye for developing self-driving car technology.Auto parts maker Delphi and Mobileye have also chosen Intel chip to power their self-driving vehicles. Initially, they would be using Intel's Core i7 chip and later on upgrade to an even faster processor that is expected to be launched by the chip-maker in a few weeks time.Intel has said that it is currently involved in 30 vehicle programs, but that number would swell to 49 by 2020. Moreover, the company's venture capital division will invest $250 million over the next two years into autonomous driving technology. The fund will support the development of self driving and other technology (connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), safety and security) for cars globally.INTEL CORP Price and ConsensusINTEL CORP Price and Consensus|INTEL CORP QuoteSelf-driving Car ParticipantsAccording to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista estimates the market for the fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025, which will be around 12-13% of the total automotive market.Self-driving car market's rapid growth potential has attracted many technology players like NVIDIA, AlphabetGOOGL, Apple and Baidu. Car makers like TeslaTSLA, General Motors, Toyota, BMW, Volvo, Nissan, Ford, Daimler, Honda and Hyundai have also been in the fray.Notable collaborations include the Ford and Baidu's partnership to jointly invest $150 million in Veldyne Lidar, a maker of light sensor technology. Alphabet has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler under which Google will incorporate its self-driving technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to be used as test vehicles.Separately, Google and Ford Motor have partnered to lead a coalition of companies that will push for federal approval of autonomous cars in the near future. Uber, Lyft and Volvo are other members of this coalition.Further, we note the recent collaboration between Tesla and Microsoft. Under the terms of the partnership, Tesla will use Microsoft's Azure to develop AI technology for its self driving cars.Where Does Intel Stands Against NVIDIA?NVIDIA is already a dominant name in the self-driving car space based on its DRIVE Automotive Technology platform. Moreover, the company's Tegra brand of mobile processors is adaptable for in-car use. The company is also partnering with major car makers like Audi, Tesla, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz.On the other hand, Intel is a relatively new name in the self-driving car space. The company's recent endeavors into the space are a part of its diversification strategy, as its products face intensifying competition in the high performance computing (HPC) market. Moreover, declining PC sales is impacting its top-line growth.Intel expects autonomous vehicles to be a core component in the world of Internet of Things (IoT), due to massive amount of data they will generate. Per Intel's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Krzanich by 2020, average autonomous car will create about 40 gigabytes of data each minute.The company anticipates that its chips will be used by autonomous vehicles to process this massive data, which will improve the self-driving technology. Moreover, it has also made some strategic acquisitions like Yogitech, Arynga and Itseez that have expanded its capabilities in terms of security and machine learning technology.Although NVIDIA is still a dominant power in the self-driving car market, we believe that Intel is fast catching up as a formidable challenger.Stock Price MovementWe note that Intel's stock price has underperformed the broader Zacks Electronic Semiconductors industry over the last one year. While the stock generated a modest return of 2.16%, the sector generated a strong return of 30.17%.We also note that Intel's performance is less impressive compared with NVIDIA over the same period. However, Intel's investments in IoT, security and memory could pay off this year. We believe that these investments will help the stock rebound going ahead.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3 China Stocks to Buy Before They Make a BIG Comeback;12/9/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDonald Trump's election victory has proved to be a major shot in the arm for most American stocks, but it certainly hasn't helped China stocks. Trump's platform of deregulation and tax cuts may result in a significant boost to U.S. corporate earnings. On the other hand, Trump has had consistently harsh words for U.S. international trading partners, specifically China and Mexico.Source:Maher Najm via FlickrTrumphas accusedChina of ""robbing Americans of billions of dollars of capital and millions of jobs."" He has also threatened to impose a 45% tariff on imported Chinese goods. Is Trump more bark than bite when it comes to China?makeArticleAd();That remains to be seen.Understandably, many U.S.-listed Chinese stocks haven't participated in the post-election rally. Trump may prove to be an unpredictable complication for Chinese companies in the near-term. But long-term investors can take advantage of the rare opportunity to buy some quality stocks following significant pullbacks. There are plenty of Chinese stocks that make fine long-term investments, and investors should buy the Trump-fueled dip.5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberWith that as a backdrop, here are three china stocks to buy on this dip.China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU)After dropping more than 5% immediately following the U.S. election,Baidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) is now only down 0.4% since Nov. 8. Since Trump's victory, the ""Chinese Google"" has held up fairly well compared to the actual Google:Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is up only 0.3% since Election Day.BIDU is the top search engine in China, but there's a strong argument that the stock is a better investment than its American counterpart. Incredibly, the internet penetration ratein Chinais still only around 50%.  That leaves plenty of opportunity for future growth.In addition to its dominant position in the Chinese internet space, Baidu has a number of potential long-term growth sources. BIDU owns the second-largest video player in China, iQiyi. The company has also invested heavily in artificial intelligence technology as well.For Americans,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is the leading brand when it comes to driverless cars.Morgan Stanleynow expects the Tesla Model 3 to begin shipping in late 2018. In China, BIDU expects to have its owndriverless caron the market in 2018 as well.When it comes to large-cap China stocks, Baidu is certainly one of the best long-term investment options. Now's the time to buy the dip in BIDU.China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA)Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) has its finger on the pulse of two of the fastest-growing segments in technology: e-commerce and cloud services.Those segments are the reason why a company the size of BABA has somehow managed to accelerate its revenue growth in recent quarters. After three straight quarters of revenue growth in the 26% to 28% range, BABA has delivered revenue growth of 33%, 48% and 47% in the past three quarters.Much likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) in the U.S., e-commerce should provide steady long-term growth for BABA. However, the company'scloud servicessegment is growing faster than any other company's in the world, including AMZN.In many ways, Alibaba stock is a bet on the Chinese economy. Despite Trump's tariff threats,Societe Generalerecently upgraded Chinese stocks from ""Underweight"" to ""Overweight."" The firm believes all emerging market economies will benefit from U.S. economic growth under Trump.The 10 Best IPOs to Buy in 2017Boston Consulting Groupprojects China's economy will grow by $2.3 trillion from 2016 to 2020. BABA stock is the best way for U.S. investors to get exposure to that astounding growth.China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd (ADR) (MPEL)I will start off by saying thatMelco Crown Entertainment Ltd (ADR)(NASDAQ:MPEL) is much more of a wildcard than BABA stock or BIDU stock.MPEL is the only U.S.-listed Chinese company that is licensed to operate casinos in the world's largest gambling destination: Macau, China. Gambling is illegal in mainland China, but it is legal in Macau.In 2014, the Chinese government decided it was going to crack down on money laundering in Macau. Macau's VIP gaming revenue subsequently plummeted as Macau high-rollers opted to avoid Macau all-together. After more than two years of declining gaming revenues, Macau recently put together four consecutive months of positive gaming revenue growth.In that four-month stretch, MPEL stock was up 37%. However, justthis week, casino operators received bad news that the Chinese government is now ramping up its regulation of Macau by slashing daily ATM withdrawal limits by 50%. The new rule goes into effect immediately and is intended to reduce currency outflow.It seems as if there has been some nefarious activity in Macau in recent years in addition to gambling. However,Las Vegashad a long history of nefarious activity prior to the modern era of massive growth.MPEL stock sold off by more than 13% on the day that China announced the new ATM restrictions.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Is Gearing Up for Model 3;12/9/2016;"At about half the price of its Model S sedan, electric-car   makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) expects its upcoming Model 3 to turn the company   into a high-volume auto manufacturer. But it will need faster,   bigger production lines in order to pull it off. And its recent   approval to double the size of its car factory in Fremont, CA,   suggests the company isn't messing around.Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Tesla needs more spaceEarlier this week, the city of Fremont approved Tesla's plans   to boost the square footage of its factory from 5.3 million to   9.9 million, Electrekreports.The expansion, which will include 11 new buildings at Tesla's   Fremont property, reaffirms the company's commitment to continue   expanding in California, and it will give the company more space   to ramp up and optimize production.Already the state's largest auto-industry employer, following   the expansion, Tesla will be an even more formidable employer in   the Golden State. Reflecting the significant investments needed   to support higher volume Model 3 production, Tesla anticipates   hiring an additional 3,000 employees as part of its plan to grow   its production in Fremont, putting total Tesla Fremont employees   above 9,000.But the company isn't waiting for this expansion to start   building production capacity for Model 3. In its most recent   shareholder letter, Tesla said it had already completed its   production line layouts for Model 3 and will soon begin   installing new body welding and final assembly lines for the   vehicle.Beyond obtaining approval to expand its factory in         Fremont and preparing to begin tooling for Model 3, the         company also continues to rapidly expand its Gigafactory,         where it plans to build batteries for Model 3 and its         energy-storage business. Tesla's Gigafactory construction         remains on track to support volume Model 3 production in         the second half of 2017, according to the company's most         recent quarterly update.Building a mass-market electric carBig investments will likely be a major theme for Tesla in the   coming quarters, as the Model 3's planned launch for the second   half of 2017 draws closer. Tesla is aiming to achieve high-volume   production before 2017 ends.Tesla's plan to double the size of its Fremont factory, which   once supported production of 500,000 vehicles annually as part of   aGeneral MotorsandToyotapartnership, comes shortly after Tesla decided to double down on   production targets -- a decision that was spurred by a surprising   373,000 deposit-backed reservations for Model 3 within a month   and a half of the vehicle's unveiling.""[G]iven the demand for Model 3, we have decided to advance   our 500,000 total unit build plan (combined for Model S, Model X,   and Model 3) to 2018, two years earlier than previously planned,""   Tesla announced in its May 4 quarterly shareholder letter.This revised target marks an astounding fivefold increase in   the company's current annualized vehicle build rate in just two   years' time. With such ambitious plans on such a short timetable,   the company is obviously going to require some significant   investments -- and doubling the size of its car factory is   apparently one of them.Tesla factory in Fremont. Image source: The Motley Fool.Ahead of its Model 3 ramp up, Tesla expects its capital   expenditures (capex) to jump sharply, starting with this quarter.   In the first three quarters of 2016, Tesla's capex amounted to   $759 million, but the company expects to spend just over $1   billion on capex in the fourth quarter alone.Going into 2017, Tesla has said its annual capex will continue   to increase as the company makes payments on Model 3   investments.Investors should keep an eye on the company's investment   progress, with particular interest in whether Tesla is staying on   track with its goal to achieve volume Model 3 production in the   second half of 2017.10 stocks we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrances Inc (ULTA) the Amazon of Brick and Mortar?;12/9/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUlta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrances Inc(NASDAQ:ULTA) is continuing its stunning growth.Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrWithout a doubt, this is the preeminent retailer in the market today. The only one that even comes close isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), but AMZN doesn't have brick and mortar stores to impede its stunning growth. Meanwhile, ULTA has mega-stores that average 10,000 square feet, with many housing a 1,000-square-foot salon.makeArticleAd();As of August 2015, it had 815 of these stores spread from sea to shining sea. And it continues to open stores at stunning rates, up to 100 stores a year. Some of the newer stores are somewhat smaller than their traditional stores, but these are usually stores that are operating where there is a standard Ulta store nearby. The slimmed-down stores offer more premium products and services.For years, analysts have been saying that ULTA stock can't keep up this pace and that eventually we'll start to see a deterioration of its sales growth and margins.Well, Q3 numbers came out last week and they didn't disappoint. Same-store sales (the true measure of a retailers' strength) were up once again by double digits, and even outpaced the company's own raised guidance for the quarter.5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberRevenues were up 24% year over year. Net income was up 23%.These are impressive numbers. And it's hard to compare Ulta to other big-box retailers, since their product lines are entirely different. So, if we takeTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) as a big-box competitor and look at its recent numbers, you might get an idea of the difference in ULTA's growth versus TGT's.In the most recently reported quarter, Target actually raised its guidance on same-store sales range from -2% to 0, to -1% to 1%. And same-store sales were down 0.2% for the quarter. Ulta same-store sales were up 17% for the quarter.What about online? TGT is doing well online, where online sales growth grew 26% year over year. But TGT has declining same-store sales, so it's vital that TGT makes up some ground on its waning brick and mortar business.On the other hand, ULTA online sales are up almost 60% so far this fiscal year.The one concern you will hear about ULTA is that it can't keep growing at this pace. And once the growth stops, it will collapse. But the 'experts' have been saying that for the past decade. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.The Biggest Enemy to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)     Stock Right Now? Time.The fact is, ULTA stock has proven it can sustain this growth and make its brick-and-mortar stores as valuable as its growing online business. Right now, margins aren't growing as fast as they could, but that's because it is continually rolling money back into expansion plans.This is a good thing, but it's the same knock people use against Amazon. And that company has been on a growth tear for a very long time. I expect the same for Ulta.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

Market Fallout From the EPA's Rush Decision;12/8/2016;"With the sun setting on the Obama presidency, the   administration and government agencies are moving quickly to set   in stone as many regulations as possible before President-elect   Donald Trump takes office. With that in mind, the Environmental   Protection Agency recently announced that is moving to finalize   its 2025 corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) emission targets   well ahead of its 2018 deadline. While this would not be   impossible for a Trump administration to roll back, the auto   industry has no choice but to move forward as if this aggressive   target will be the law of the land.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The EPA will require automakers to have a fleet average of   54.5 miles per gallon. If that looks like a high number to you,   it's because it is. Official testing numbers are always higher   than real-world results -- theWall Street Journalexpects the actual number to be closer to 40 mpg, but even then   it's still a huge gap to bridge.Currently, vehicles average 24.8 mpg in real-world use. While   we have seen a huge, 28% improvement in efficiency over the last   decade -- thanks, in part, to forced induction, direct injection,   and stop-start technology -- that only equated to 5.5 miles per   gallon. A similar efficiency increase would leave us just over 30   mpg and well short of the EPA's mandate.There's only one way to meet this aggressive goal: a massive   increase in electric vehicle sales over the next decade.   Significant efforts to achieve this goal are already underway.   The implications of this have flown under the market's radar,   giving investors an opportunity to be ahead of the curve.One winnerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is poised to be a winner despite increased direct   competition from established luxury players and downward pricing   pressure from mass-market manufacturers. Unlike legacy   automakers, Tesla won't be burdened by attempting to juggle the   production, sales, and maintenance of two different propulsion   systems to meet these new stringent regulations.Tesla is also better positioned and further along its   transition from pure carmaker to mobility provider. Investors   should not underestimate the significance of the automaker's   Gigafactory -- its massive scale lowers costs and enables the   company to become a battery supplier to the rest of the   industry.Volkswagenis planning to build its own battery production facility in   Germany, but smaller automakers may decline the huge up-front   costs of a vertically integrated supply chain. Given its   execution risk and premium valuation, Tesla may not be the safest   play for investors, but I anticipate it will remain a leader in   the space.One loserSuppliers who derive a large portion of their revenue from   powertrain systems, likeDelphiAutomotive(NYSE: DLPH) , will face stagnation, if not erosion of that   business over the coming decades. Delphi's largest unit is still   electrical/electronic architecture, but 28% of its net sales in   2015 were tied to the internal combustion engine.The rise of electrification and advanced driving technology   has also given rise to new competitors. Take, for instance,General Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt, a $37,500 mass-market EV with a   200-mile range. The Bolt's battery pack, motors, and infotainment   system are supplied by South Korean consumer-electronics giantLG.This is not simply an anecdotal point. As cars transition   toward becoming giant self-driving smartphones, the OEMs will   require a set of solutions more easily supplied by large tech   companies. Current suppliers need forward-thinking management,   plus a commitment to innovation, and even then they still may   come up short.The Foolish bottom lineWhile auto industry insiders may be grumbling about the EPA's   aggressive move to finalize without further debate, the   requirements itself are not a surprise -- the industry agreed to   these terms in 2012. Given the long lead time of auto development   and the giant step up in requirements, it's only a matter of time   before consumers have a variety of electric options at different   price points from most automakers.We can't afford to think of this as just a typical cyclical   industrial industry anymore. Major upheaval is on the cusp of   happening, and a forward-looking view of the new automotive   landscape will reward investors.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Facebook Inc (FB), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (GOOG);12/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsNewer technology names continue to struggle during this sector   migration as investors continue to eye the new bull market   sectors like materials, industrials and transportation stocks.   The result is that a large number of the traditional technology   leaders are under pressure from their charts.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all in the position of lagging broader indices. It has   become time for a make-or-break situation as each are currently   facing short-term chart resistance.makeArticleAd();Facebook Inc (FB)Shares of Facebook had struggled since the election for a few   reasons. The drop in price transitioned the 50-day moving average   for FB stock into a bearish trend, indicating a higher   probability of lower prices over the next 4 to 6 weeks if the   trend remains in place.The fact that the stock recently moved below its heavily   monitored 200-day trendline and is now finding resistance at the   $120-price where it resides has put Facebook shares into this   must-win situation. This is FB's current ""must-win"" price as a   break above will open some room overhead for the stock to move   higher.The 10 Biggest Stock Market Successes of       2016Facebook shares recently benefited from an oversold technical   bounce, but volume has dried after that rally, indicating that   the bounce may be more of the ""dead cat"" variety.For now, traders should steer clear of FB as a rejection   at $120 is likely to target another wave of selling and the   potential for Facebook to test its June lows of $108.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)Another technology company struggling in a downward trend is   Tesla Motors. Since peaking in April, TSLA shares have shed over   25% as the stock charts a pattern of lower highs and lower   lows.  The pattern suggests that Tesla stock is   suffering as traders and investors are taking any rally as   an opportunity to reduce holdings.From a long-term perspective, TSLA is trading in a bear market   as the stock is well below its 20-month moving average, which is   also trending lower. Some traders may see Tesla stock as a   ""value"", but the technical trend suggests otherwise.Looking at the chart, TSLA's ""must win"" price is at $195; the   spot where its 50-day moving average currently sits. This   trendline has been staunch resistance for Tesla stock since it   rolled over in August and began to trend lower.From there, TSLA stock gets into a technical pinch as   support is immediately below at $180. This means that we're   likely to see an increase in volatility in Tesla shares as one of   these key levels is going to give way for the next big move in   the stock.Alphabet Inc (GOOG)Alphabet is the last of the stocks in the technical must-win   situation today. While GOOG shares have been lagging the   broader market, they are performing better than a large number of   technology stocks.As early as last week, Alphabet shares found key support at   their 200-day moving average. From there, GOOG stock shot back to   the $800-level where it is going to find some resistance impeding   its move higher.International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)       Stock: 2 Reasons to BuyThe proposed resistance comes in the form of a confluence of   technical trendlines, namely the 50- and 100-day moving averages   of Alphabet's price. Both trendlines intersect just below $800   and they will certainly start to tip technical traders to sell   unless GOOG stock breaks cleanly higher.Volume on Alphabet shares is lightening up a bit as the   traders are taking a wait and see attitude towards the $200   price. This makes this level the ""must win"" target for   GOOG over the next few trading days.Failure to break higher will likely result in another trip to   the $760 price, where the 200-day trendline resides. This has   supported the stock twice in the last month. Given the inversion   of the 50-day moving average, the risk of the 200-day moving   average giving way to lower prices is now higher.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy for DecemberThe 10 Best IPOs to Buy in 2017The post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Facebook Inc   (FB), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (GOOG)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Rising Oil Prices Are Good for EVs and Renewable Energy;12/8/2016;"If you're a fan of wind power, solar power, electric vehicles,   or any other form of alternative energy or transportation, you   should be cheering OPEC's recently announced agreement to cut 1.8   million barrels per day in production from both OPEC and non-OPEC   countries' supply. Most of the reaction on the stock market   related to oil stocks surging, but this is really great news for   alternative energy as well.The reason comes down to the other half of the energy equation   we often don't talk about. The simple fact of the matter is that   many in the industry are beginning to talk regularly about how   quickly the cost of solar energy is falling or how cheap   batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming. But the other   side is the fossil fuel energy they're competing against. Higheroil   pricesmake EVs more attractive on a cost basis and will make   corporations, consumers, and governments think twice about where   they're spending energy dollars in the future. Rising oil prices   is the push alternatives need.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.The dollar drives everythingIf you look at the growing adoption of solar energy, wind   energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles -- the four biggest   cogs in a renewable energy future -- they've all been driven   primarily by economics over the past decade.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity subsidiary grew on the back of a $0   down solar lease and wind and solar energy are winning   competitive bids for electricity contracts around the world. New   technologies like energy storage are helping commercial customers   lower electricity bills and costs are improving constantly. To   top it off, EVs are starting to take off just as cars priced   around $35,000 are hitting the market.Subsidies get a lot of coverage in the media, but non-fossil   fuel forms of energy are competing with fossil fuels because   they're a lower-cost option and that cost advantage is improving   by the day. Higher oil prices only improves the competitive   advantage of alternative energy, which makes it more attractive   to buyers like utilities and corporations making choices about   where they're going to get energy in the future.The perception battle in energyOne of the strange dynamics in energy is that oil dominates   perception of what sources of energy are competitive. Even in   solar energy, where the competition is really with coal and   natural gas, when oil is high people love the idea of solar   energy, and when oil is low investors just don't believe in the   solar future.This can be seen on the stock market, where solar   manufacturers and developersFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) have long been impacted directly by the price of   oil. Look below at their performance as oil prices dropped in   2014. As oil fell, so did their stocks, even though they're not   really related businesses.WTI Crude Oil Spot Pricedata byYCharts.Whether you're thinking about putting solar on your roof or   buying your next vehicle, the perception of energy prices is just   as important as the real price you pay for energy. And increasing   oil and gasoline prices are maybe the best reminder of what   energy costs, whether or not they directly compete with   alternative sources of energy.Where we can expect to see winnersIf oil prices do rise, I would expect that to have a major   impact on the adoption rate of electric vehicles. Tesla is   clearly leading the charge there led by the Model S and upcoming   Model 3, butGeneral Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevy Bolt hitting the market later this year will be   worth watching if gasoline heads toward $4 per gallon again. EVs   can justify themselves on economics alone if gas prices rise. It   costs about $12 to fill a Model S with over 300 miles of range,   compared to $40 or more if gas is $4 per gallon. So, rising gas   prices will make EVs more competitive just as low cost EVs hit   the market.Solar and wind energy will also be winners, particularly on   the utility side. When wind and solar projects are built, they   come with long-term power purchase agreements, setting the price   of electricity for a utility. Rising oil prices will be another   hard reminder that commodity risk falls on consumers, and with   the cost of renewable energy now competitive with fossil fuel   across the country, it'll be a risk regulators won't want to ask   customers to take.On the consumer end of things, we could see another big solar   push as well. What better way to break free of foreign oil than   by putting solar on your roof and using it to charge your   electric vehicle?Surging oil prices may be just what alternative fuels and   renewable energy need heading into a Trump administration. And it   looks like they'll be here just in time.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

The companylaid off a few dozen employeeswho had been working on the project, nicknamed Titan, just a few months after naming Apple veteran Bob Mansfield as chief of the Apple car project. The sudden (and mostly unexpected) changes suggested to current and would-be owners of AAPL stock that things were not going swimmingly on the autonomous vehicle front.makeArticleAd();Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashAs it turns out, the market may have read a little too much into the restructuring.Though Apple may well be backing off on its plans to develop its own car, as a letter recently submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) suggests the company has put the pedal to the metal with its plans to build an artificial intelligence system that can drive a car.Apple ""Investing Heavily In Machine Learning""In aletter written by Apple's VP of Product Integrity, Steve Kenner, to the NHSTA on Nov. 22, Apple noted:""Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year … It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation.Apple affirms that, in order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHSTA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking. NHTSA and Congress should also continue to explore new tools and authorities like those outlines in Section IV of the Policy - including expanded exemption authority - with the goal of fostering innovation, improving regulatory flexibility, and encouraging the development of life-saving technology.""Translation: Apple is very much behind the eight-ball in terms of developing self-driving systems, and unless the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration helps the company out in a big way, AAPL shareholders are going to be severely disappointed that Apple didn't capitalize on the opportunity when it could have done so several years ago.7 A-Rated Tech Stocks That Power the IndustryRivals already working on machine-learning for the purpose of autonomous cars are, of course,Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), just to name a few. GM already has a fleet ofabout 30 autonomous vehiclesin testing, and the technology now comesstandard on all Teslas. Alphabet - Google - has already put2 million miles on its fleet of autonomous cars.It's not clear where the development of the self-driving Apple car technology is. It is clear, though, it's not nearly as far along as the platform created by others in the space. It has got a lot of catching up to do. The letter to the NHTSA was meant to be a means of keeping that door open.Bottom Line for AAPL StockApple spokesman Tom Neumayradded to the discussion on Friday of last week:""We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. … There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.""It's Neumayr's thoughts that really add some much-needed color to the matter … that,and the notion that""established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.""In short, Apple knows it's behind its competition, but after spending an untold amount of money on the development of self-driving automobile technology, it can't walk away empty-handed now.Perhaps the most noteworthy thing owners of AAPL stock may want to digest is that Kenner's letter was neither solicited nor required. The NHTSA is simply open to hearing suggestions about how it can most effectively shape its guidelines for the advent of autonomous cars. Apple's suggestions just so happen to be favorable to Apple's present situation on the R&D front; the agency isn't required to take them.Expedia Inc (EXPE) Spinoff Trivago Nears IPO TakeoffIn a bigger sense, the fact that a five-page plea was submitted at all at this stage of the game could be an indirect sign that Apple is simply too far behind in this race to ever meaningfully catch up.That's OK. Such a platform was never entirely in the company's wheelhouse anyway. Unless its work-to-date is close to being a finished project though - something Apple could plug into a car in the very near future with little additional cost - AAPL shareholders may find the autonomous car project is a little too fruitless to continue supporting.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Best Investments for 2017The 10 Biggest Stock Market Successes of 2016The postApple Inc.

3 Stocks That Could Make You Rich;12/1/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.If someone tells you that they have stock picks that they   guarantee will make you rich -- run the other way. However, an   investment style of looking for rule-breaking companies with   incredible management teams, ones that are investing in   exponential growth rather than meeting short-term expectations,   is a good way to earn long-term portfolio growth. Here's why   these three stocks are those kinds of holdings, along with other   companies that fall within the same investing style, that could   make investors rich.Under ArmourUnder Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UA-C) was a market darling for the last few   years -- until it wasn't in the most recent quarter. Shares were   hammered around 20% the day of its recent Q3 earnings release   when management said that it no longer expected to reach a 2018   profit goal of $800 million.makeArticleAd();Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said the reason that the company   would not meet its previous goal is that it is investing more   heavily in future growth, including building out its   international business and increasing its focus on footwear. The   company is also making other investments in things likeoverhauling its manufacturing processesand starting new lines of clothing such as the recently launched   Under Armour Sportswear.From Under Armour's manufacturing innovation lab in Baltimore.   Image source: Under Armour.This is the perfect example of a company that the market has   punished for taking a long-term growth strategy. To be fair,   Under Armour certainly faces risks from intense competition and   other hurdles to future growth, but so far the company has   continued to innovate and grow in incredible ways, and its future   prospects still look solid. Sales are still on track to reach   their previously set goal of $7.5 billion by 2018, so for   investors willing to look past 2018 earnings, this recent drop   could be a very attractive entry point for longer-term gains.ShopifyAnother stock with massive long-term potential isShopify(NYSE: SHOP) , the online shopping and payment portal that has   partnered with some of the biggest names in business as well as   hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs to provide e-commerce   solutions. Now with more than 325,000 merchants as of the most   recent quarter, a 62% jump year over year, Shopify is beginning   to reach a scale at which it will start to become very   interesting. The total value of sales processed through Shopify's   platform was almost $4 billion during the quarter, double from a   year ago.Image source: Shopify.To attract merchants, Shopify just recently began offering   payment solutions throughFacebookMessenger, released a Shopify mobile app to make it easier for   merchants to do business on the go, and addedApplePay to its website. Sales for the most recent quarter grew   89% year over year, and they look to have plenty of room to keep   surging.Shopify is still reporting a loss, as it's using money to   invest in making its platform better, and also spending more   heavily on marketing and other ways to bring on more merchants.   However, Shopify recently closed a successful new stock offering,   meaning that it has plenty of cash for the year ahead, and   expects to break even in 2017. For all of those reasons,Shopify stock looks like a growth gem.Image source: NvidiaNVIDIALast but certainly not least,NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA)  continues to prove why it deserves a place   on this list. This chipmaker is one of the most dynamic and   connected companies in its industry, working withthe biggest namesin autonomous cars, video games, virtual reality development, and   artificial intelligence. The company recently announced   that its Drive PX2 platform will officially be used for   Tesla's future self-driving cars.In the most recent quarter, NVIDIA blew analyst expectations   out of the water by reporting $2 billion in sales, ahead of the   $1.68 billion guidance. GAAP earnings per share grew an   impressive 89% year over year.NVIDIA is by far the leader in many of the most exciting   categories it's going after, and its technology looks to be   leading in those areas. The stock has risen substantially already   this year, so its price-to-earnings ratio looks relatively   expensive now at 48. Still, with earnings growing quickly, the   stock is trading at 35 times next year's earnings estimate, and   looking further out into the future, this stock looks even more   attractive.Find out why Nvidiais one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

International Business Machine Corp.’s (IBM) Not-So-Secret Weapon: Watson;12/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) has been a frequent member of theDow Jones Composite Averageand one of the most followed stocks on Wall Street. IBM stock sports a market capitalization of $150 billion and has to explore new areas to continue its growth. Luckily for IBM, the company has an ace up its sleeve in the form of Watson.Source:Atomic Taco via FlickrThe Jeopardy-winning super computer is pushing International Business Machines into new areas, including its latest launch in autonomous cars. Boosted by Watson, IBM stock looks like a buy.makeArticleAd();Watson is most famous for defeating two Jeopardy champions in a televised three-day event back in 2011. During the competition, Watson beat Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a win of $77,147 to $24,000 (Jennings) and $21,600 (Rutter). International Business Machines won $1 million from Watson's performance, which went to charity. The bigger win for the company was showing off just how powerful its supercomputer was at learning anything fed at it.Watson and Autonomous CarsIBM stock could get a boost if the company's latest push into autonomous cars pays off. The company is starting small by going after the bus market, but its technology could soon find its way into autonomous cars through partnerships with major automobile manufacturers.TheOlli driverless transit vehiclewas shown off at the Los Angeles Auto Show with full demonstrations. Designed by Local Motors, this is the first product to use Watson in its automotive technology. This autonomous car can transport 12 passengers along pre-determined or on-demand routes at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour. Local Motors calls the vehicle perfect for current bus routes, airports, theme parks or college campuses.10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy in     2017IBM stock won't see a huge boost from this early Watson-powered device. The possibilities here are what investors should be excited about when International Business Machines finally lands inside other autonomous cars.Perhaps the coolest feature from IBM's Watson is theabilityfor passengers to talk to their autonomous car Olli and ask questions about the route, the technology used or recommendations for places to go. Watson acts similar toApple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri orAmazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa.The difference here is that International Business Machines' Watson doesn't just provide facts, it is able to familiarize itself with the person inside the vehicle and learn patterns that could lead to better feedback and recommendations.Earlier this year, Watson software was also used byGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) for its new OnStar Go platform. The service, which will be available to more than 12 million automobiles, is a ""cognitive mobility platform"".Like Olli, passengers will be able to ask for recommendations and see tailored settings to their habits. This OnStar platform will also use IBM to help launch advertisers and partners, likeMastercard Inc(NYSE:MA), iHeartRadio andExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM). This partnership could be the first of several between GM and International Business Machines.IBM has been pushing its internet of things business and is listing automotive as one of the areas on its site. Olli is being rolled out in Washington D.C. and has deals in place with Miami and Las Vegas. This puts autonomous cars on the road using International Business Machines' Watson as the brains.The internet of things market remains a huge opportunity for IBM stock. The companyseesthe IOT market hitting $11 trillion by 2025 and 250 million connected vehicles on the road by 2020. That's why International Business Machines is pushing Watson and its other businesses into connected areas like homes, buildings, retailers and vehicles.IBM pushed Watson into the healthcare field shortly after its Jeopardy win. Watson has gone on to be aforce in the healthcare fieldin areas like medical imaging, cancer treatment, diabetes treatment and diagnostics. A 2013 article hit on the fact thatusing Watson was helping doctors better diagnose patients' conditions. In lung cancer diagnosis, International Business Machines' Watson had a success rate of 90% versus doctors' 50% rate.Bottom Line on IBM StockThe push of IOT and Watson is starting to benefit the company's financials and should soon boost IBM stock. International Business Machines reported a strong third quarter, powered by growth in its cloud businesses.Cloud revenue hit $12.7 billion over the last reported twelve months; Cloud-as-a-Service has an annual run rate of $7.5 billion. And the company's Technology Services & Cloud Platforms segment led the way in the quarter with $8.7 billion in revenue.Can Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Use Solar Roofs to     Sell More Cars?IBM continues to be one of the most promising technology companies for the future. The company is pushing further into the internet of things, a major growth area for years to come. And Watson is a great tool that is being used by the company to expand into new areas. Its entry into autonomous cars may seem small, but with the name recognition of Watson and the demonstration at the Los Angeles Auto Show, I would expect more deals to come soon.IBM stock trades close to a 52-week high and has seen a nice increase of 16% in 2016. The stock has declined 9% over a five-year period and remains far off from the $200-level it saw just a few years ago. Look for Watson and new growth areas to rev up International Business Machines stock over the short- and long-term.As of this writing, Chris Katje did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend     Stocks to Buy NowThe Top 10 Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017The postInternational Business Machine Corp.'s (IBM) Not-So-Secret Weapon: Watsonappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Can Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Use Solar Roofs to Sell More Cars?;12/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter the successful completion of the deal to acquireSolarCity Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY), Elon Musk announced thatTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is officially entering the home building arena. According to Bloomberg, TSLA stock will begin offering revolutionary new solar-powered residential roofs sometime in 2017.Source:Windell Oskay via Flickr (Modified)In avideo presentationon the Tesla website, Musk stated that his company's new roofs are expected to cost less than traditional roofs, and that ""electricity is just a bonus.""makeArticleAd();Fortune reported that much of the projected cost savings for homeowners is tied to the expectation that a new Tesla solar roof will be""lighter and easier to ship, thus reducing costs on breakage and transportation.""Bloomberg called the roofs ""stunning"" and described them as ""a range of four solar roofing materials that lookvirtually indistinguishable from high-end terracotta, slate or slick modern asphalt shingles.""Musk Will Incorporate Panasonic Solar TechnologyThrough a partnership withPanasonic Corporation (ADR)(OTCMKTS:PCRFY), a company that has struggled to generate profit in the solar industry, TSLA and SCTY plan to manufacture the solar roof tiles in SolarCity's Buffalo, New York, factory when construction is completed.The 3 Best Mega-Cap Tech Stocks to Buy on a     DipAccording to Musk, the Tesla solar roof tiles could incorporate""a lot of techniques from the automotive glass business,""and that glass is ""very cheap and very resilient."" Ideally, combining TSLA's financial resources with expertise in the creation of increasingly efficient solar panels from SCTY and PCRFY has the potential to yield some extremely impressive residential roofing options.Some analysts are concerned about TSLA's ability to actually manufacture these revolutionary new roofing tiles in the large-scale quantities that might be necessary if Musk's endeavor takes off. Additionally, there has been concern about theinternal technology Musk will be usingto generate electricity from a Tesla solar roof; two years ago, SCTY acquired a small startup calledSilevo, which had been developing new technology that apparently exceeded the efficiency of existing solar panels.However, the Silevo panels hadn't reached production stage, yet, and SCTY has not announced any advancements in their development. But, according to Fortune, SCTY stated that the Tesla solar roof will incorporate several components from all three companies - Tesla, SolarCity and Panasonic - and""integrate them into the new solar module that will be produced in Buffalo, NY.""Can a Tesla Solar Roof Sell More Cars?While it wasn't something directly mentioned or discussed by Musk, it's hard to ignore the connection between TSLA's dominant electric vehicle line and the creation of high-end residential solar roofs.With more businesses and consumers looking to ""go green"" and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Tesla and SolarCity are both in solid positions to excel in the years ahead.That being said, it's not a giant leap to imagine TSLA offering to add the proper electrical interface and infrastructure required to house a Tesla vehicle into a home being outfitted with a new solar roof.On the east coast, for example, one of the largest obstacles to owning a Model S is a lack of charging stations. Owners mustmodify existing electrical systems in their homesto allow for proper charging of such a vehicle.Considering that the Tesla solar roof currently resembles modern high-end roofing materials, the demographic that would most likely be in a position to afford such a purchase might also likely be amenable to purchasing a high-end electric car. This possibility could be increased if incentives were added to solar roof purchases, making a new TSLA vehicle even more affordable.What This Means for TSLA and SCTY InvestorsIn the short term, there isn't likely to be much in the way of an impact on SCTY or TSLA stock, as Musk's recent announcement was just that - an announcement. There is, indeed, rather significant potential for shareholders if Musk can successfully manufacture his solar roof tiles in sufficient quantities and at affordable prices. However, none of this will happen until the construction of SolarCity's new factory in Buffalo is finally completed.Considering only the new solar roof project, shareholders of both SolarCity andTesla stockshould continue to hold their current positions.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Surface Studio     Upgradability Is HorridBut, once construction of the Buffalo factory is finished and manufacturing of the solar roof tiles begins, investors should keep a close eye on the sales and production numbers.Bottom Line on Tesla and SolarCityA partnership between Tesla, the undisputed king of the electric automobile market, and SolarCity, the largest residential and commercial solar energy provider in the U.S., has the potential to be a match made in heaven, ultimately benefiting both companies and their respective shareholders - if Musk's bold jump into the residential solar arena pays off.Even considering the fact that the solar roof technology Musk intends to use hasn't been as extensively tested as traditional solar cell materials and techniques, the companies involved - Tesla, SolarCity, and Panasonic - are an impressive force with extensive resources and experience in this industry.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the WorldThe postCan Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Use Solar Roofs to Sell More Cars?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Finally, Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Gets Some Love!;12/1/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares inFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) were on fire to start December, as both saw strong gains in November sales and investors suddenly saw how cheap GM and Ford stock are.Source:Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)The big U.S. brands rose rather than their international competitors because U.S. demand again was dominated by light trucks, with both Ford and GMbeating analyst estimates on sales growth.Ford alone sold over 197,000 vehicles during November, with pickup sales growing 14% to 72,000.makeArticleAd();Even with gains of nearly 7% in Ford stock and 5% in GM stock, these picks are still incredibly cheap. Ford trades at just 7 times earnings, it's covering its dividend of 15 cents per share easily with profits, and the yield of 4.7% is higher than any government bond. GM boasts a P/E of slightly more than 4, and a yield of 4.2% is covered four times over by net income.Can the Love Last?What everyone asks when there are good auto sales is, can it last?It is now assumed that, in a world of Trump, which is dedicated to protecting manufacturing and energy jobs, the answer at least for now is that it can. If it can, your investment in General Motors stock today will be covered by earnings before the new President's term expires in early 2021.10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy in     2017The question becomes whether these companies deserve a higher multiple, and more stock market respect, than they are currently getting.WhileTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is marginally profitable and is worth more than half its big auto rivals, and over 7 times its annual sales, Ford is consistently profitable, yet F stock sells for just one-third of its annual sales volume.Ford and GM also retain the financial strength to go after the heart of Tesla's strategic advantages,autonomous drivingandalternative fuel vehicles.Ford's work in alternative fuels was spurred by Obama administration CAFE standards mandating that cars get 60 miles to the gallon by 2025, and light trucks get50 miles to the gallon. Electric vehicles, which don't use gasoline, are included in the calculations, making the numbers manageable.Will Institutions Buy GM and Ford Stock?While there was more institutional selling of Ford stock than buying during the third quarter, several hedge funds jumped in.If the balance between buying and selling adjusts to the buy side this quarter, it could cause a run on the stock which, even if it leads to a P/E of just 10, would bring a 40% gain to both Ford and GM stock holders.When last reported on the companies' 13-F reports, just 56% of Ford stock was held by institutions, while more than 70% of GM stock was institutionally owned. By way of contrast, over 80% of stock in Google parentAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is held by institutions.Institutions have been reluctant to invest in the automakers because they have seen it as a no-growth area with outdated technology. But autonomous, self-driving cars should be a high-growth market opportunity, and if the automakers continue to seize it as they are presently doing the view of both stocks could shift dramatically in 2017.Fitbit Inc (FIT) In Talks to Acquire Smartwatch     Pioneer PebbleOn the other hand, this could be a one-off, a knee-jerk reaction to better-than-expected sales news, and the gains could be short-lived if institutional buyers decide that incentives merely stole volume from later sales, and that profitability will be reduced by those incentives, which often include knocked-down prices and interest-free loans. Higher interest rates also could have a dramatic impact on the sector, making such deals unavailable to next year's buyers.For now, the automakers are enjoying the one-day stand and hoping it becomes a more permanent relationship.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Why GM Is Willing to Lose 9K on Each Green Vehicle Sold;12/1/2016;"General Motors CompanyGMis expected to incur a loss of around $9,000 on every Chevrolet Bolt it will be selling in the U.S. The automaker is willing to bear the expenses as it believes that the strategy will pay off in the long run.makeArticleAd();Other automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.FCAUand Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.NSANYare also incurring losses in order to sell zero emission vehicles (ZEV). Fiat Chrysler is losing $14,000 per vehicle while Nisan Leaf has advertised low lease deals for $149.The reasons behind this strategy include:State GuidelinesThe state of California requires automakers to sell some environment-friendly vehicles in order to do business there. Nine other states have also adopted this strategy, including New York and New Jersey. Together, these states make up around 30% of the total U.S. market. This forces automakers to boost sales of ZEV in these markets.Stricter state laws are expected to require ZEVs to contribute 15.4% of vehicle sales by 2025, which is five times the current level. To meet this target, sales of ZEVs, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars will rise.Moreover, after the development of charging-station infrastructure and decline in battery costs, global demand for ZEV is poised to rise significantly. There will also be huge demand for ZEVs in China as it is taking note of the climate change threats.Tax BenefitsU.S. offers incentives for the productions of ZEVs. The government provides $7,500 of tax credits to buyers. In addition, the government gives credits to automakers for fulfilling the greenhouse gas reduction target set by Obama administration.Appeal to Younger CustomersChevrolet Bolt will appeal more to young, technologically savvy customers. Bolt offers 238-mileage, which is better than the other mass-market electric vehicles. It will be available to customers in California and Oregon starting this month. General Motors also plans to launch the Bolt in China and Europe. This will give it an advantage over electric automaker Tesla Motors, Inc.'sTSLAmass vehicle Model 3, which will be available from next year.ZEV CreditsGeneral Motors will earn more credits if it sells more ZEVs. It can also sell the surplus credits to its competitors. This will have a positive impact on the results of the company.Price PerformanceIn the last three months, General Motors' share price increased 7.37% while the auto tire truck market share price declined over 1.09%. The company benefitted from better results recorded in the last quarter and its initiatives including expansion of Maven and investment in facilities.

Thanks to Tesla Motors' Brilliance, Some Auto Suppliers Face Rapidly Approaching Challenges;12/1/2016;"Tesla's Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , one of the few electric vehicle start-ups to   survive the financial crisis and the Great Recession, has done an   incredible job of rebranding the electric vehicle. At a time when   many consumers pictured an electric vehicle as a small,   awkward-looking car that struggled to reach 50 miles per hour on   the highway, Tesla was designing the Model S, which would leave   those stereotypes in the dust. While major automakers' EV   programs remained in their infancy, or neglected, Tesla was   establishing its Supercharger network to alleviate range anxiety   and was breaking ground on its Gigafactory.Tesla, despite its manufacturing flaws and unpredictable   strategy (cough,SolarCityacquisition,cough), has lit a fire under major automakers to accelerate their own   EV programs. And that spells bad news for a cluster of auto   supplier stocks.makeArticleAd();What's the big deal?Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas explained the issue in a   note to investors, while cutting his price target onDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH)  from $74 down to $59:Roughly 25% of Delphi's global profit comes from its     powertrain division, a collection of businesses that optimize     the combustion of diesel and gasoline through highly engineered     pumps, injection systems, fuel delivery, exhaust flow, emission     canisters, throttle controls, and sophisticated control     modules. We're not suggesting these products will be replaced     immediately, but we do see scope for diminished economic     returns given changing OEM priorities that create material risk     to the company's earnings trajectory.To make matters worse for auto supplier stocks, that's far   from the only risk. Their margins would be squeezed if the prices   of steel, copper, aluminum, and other raw material move higher   after years of weakness. Combine that with the fact that major   automakers have begun to consolidate vehicle platforms and parts   in an effort to increase their scale and reduce the number of   suppliers -- that means less pricing power for suppliers, year   after year. In fact,General Motorsplans to move from 14 core and 12 regional vehicle architectures   in 2015 down to 4 vehicle sets by 2025. And that's leaving out   the obvious risk that auto suppliers are tied to a highly   cyclical auto industry, and that a key global market, America,   appears to be plateauing after years of consistent growth. Not to   mention, we're not sure how President-elect Donald Trump's NAFTA   threats will play out for the auto industry.Now, it's not as if the executives at auto suppliers don't see   the looming risks, but so far, they haven't been quick to adapt.   Also, it appears that Tesla, approaching the release of its   mass-affordable Model 3, is looking past traditional suppliers.   ""Tesla is turning to South Korean parts makers, which are more   cost-competitive than Japanese rivals, as the electric car   start-up plans to drastically cut costs for the cheaper Model 3,""   said Eim Eun-young, an auto analyst at Samsung Securities,   according toAutomotive News.All is not lostDespite looming headwinds, there are auto suppliers better   suited to survive, and there will be ways for others to evolve,   as none of this will happen overnight. For instance,Lear Corp(NYSE: LEA) is focused on vehicle trends that would be less   impacted by electric vehicles, such as automotive electronics,   higher-quality interiors, and parts in the luxury segment.Magna International Inc.(NYSE: MGA) , as another example, has a massive global footprint   that is extremely important to major automakers and generates   almost half of its sales from Detroit automakers, which will   continue to produce a plethora of trucks and SUVs for the   foreseeable future.Delphi even has ambitious plans beyond electric vehicles.
