(AAPL) Stock Fall If the iPhone 8 Flops?;3/24/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsCal a spade a spade,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most recogniz name in the world. By extension, AAPL stock remain one of the market' most sought-aft picks.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigit via FlickrBoth platitud are well deserved. The compani ha earn it way to the top, make a piec of hardwar - the iPhon - not onli a technic marvel, but a statu symbol and lifestyl centerpiec like no other. The devic keep million of consum rang from tween to geriatr with their nose buri in their smartphon in all four corner of the earth.Nevertheless …While Appl ha been larg deserv of it spot on so mani investors' pedestals, that sort of collect homag is alway dangerous. Noth last forever, and as unpopular as the premis may be, it would be wise to at least entertain the possibl that the next-gener iPhon (refer to the iPhon 8 so far) could the unveil that start expos Apple' cracks.iPhon 8 Flop? Never!Befor you pull out your pitchfork, start heat up the tar and gather your feathers, dial it back just a bit. Thi isn't to say that even a mediocr Appl still isn't better than most ani other stock on the planet.10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market CrashStill, there are three key reason the iPhon 8 could end up not beingth panaceait ha been made out to be. Yes, they'r rather obvious, but concern all the same:1. Peopl Realli Are Grow Tire of the Constant ConnectivityIt wa fun for a few years, but some smartphon owner - an increas number of them - are start to realiz their unhealthi addict to their devices. A survey perform last year indic that42% of Americansconstantli check their phone for new messages. It' a statist be notic by imparti observ like CTV technolog analyst Carmi Levy.Levi commentedlast year:""Th promis of technolog is that it'll improv our lives, but sometim we becom enslav to the technolog becaus there' so much go on. A certain part of our brain is alway look for someth that is perhap simpler … and deliv as promis with fewer frustrations.""Enough consum are start to move the notion out of their subconsci into their conscious.2. $1,000 for a Phone? Really?Yep, somebodi out there won't think twice about pay it. A lot of peopl won't think twice about pay it. For a wide swath of iPhon fan who will sooner or later realiz that' more than one month' rent or mortgag payment, though, they'r due a ""get real"" moment.3. Strong CompetitionFor the longest time, Appl had littl to no competition. That' chang though. Yes,th explod batteri debacleSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) face with it Galaxi 7 phone wa damning, and it' not like the Googl Pixel fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)wa a smash successthat threaten Appl either.Both compani are still overhaul their hardwar and improv their design though, and consum are take notice, for about a third to half the cost of an iPhone.Potenti Impact on AAPL StockA for the impact a lacklust iPhon 8 respons might have on AAPL stock, one can onli guess. But, one can still make an educ guess.For it most recent complet quarter, Applesold 78.29 million iPhones, gener $54.38 billion worth of revenue. That' not necessarili a full pictur of the then-new iPhon 7' success, however. The devic wa actual unveil a few day prior to the begin of the quarter, and saw tremend sale immedi after it launch. For the iPhon 7' inaugur quarter, the compani producediPhon revenu of $28.16 billion, sell 45.51 million units. Between both quarters, the bulk of the iPhon sold were the 7 model.It wa record-break success, by the way, with the78.29 million iPhon sold last quarteredg out sale of the second edit of the iPhon 6 in the compar quarter a year earlier. The averag sell price for the most recent quarter come out to $695 apiece.That price tag doe present someth of a quandari for ani estim regard the impend success of the iPhon 8. It could sell 30% fewer phones, but inasmuch as the cost of the 8 is more than 40% greater than the 7, Appl could conceiv do just as well (and possibl post wider margins).Thi is where put AAPL stock on a pedest becom a bit of a problem though.Bottom Line for AppleFor better or worse, Appl sharehold have larg been train to expect beat not just of revenu and earn estimates, but also beat of sale as measur by units. Ani weak on ani front pose a risk to a usual frothi AAPL valuation.Mi prediction? I firmli believ the iPhon 8 will be an unexpect disappointment, though that' distinctli differ than a flop. Some - though not all - will balk at a four-figur sticker price, forc peopl to final ask themselv ""What are we doing, pay a thousand buck to keep in touch onFacebookand to play mobil video game on a five inch screen?""Again, don't misunderstand. I fulli acknowledg there are some utilitarian featur on the iPhon 8 that will be view as a must-hav for some consumers.Wireless chargingi convenient, and the built-in touch ID is go to be critic to some busi user concern about security.Bi and larg though, I have to believ the averag consum just want a phone they can use to stay connected, via the web and voice. An edge-to-edg screen or a lack of a home button isn't the game-chang it' be made it to be, especi at $1,000 a pop … even for peopl who onli own the iPhon as a statu symbol.Krog Co (KR) Stock Look Veri Attract Right NowTo quantifi my pessimism, I'm guess Appl sell 70 million unit of the iPhon 8 in it first full quarter start in October. That translat into more year-over-year revenue, but is still a letdown for what' suppos to be ""the best iPhon ever."" Such a result could easili send AAPL sock careening, though odd are good the market would figur it out befor the offici number were releas by the company. AAPL stock could lose as much as 20% of it valu on that kind of worry.Perhap wors than the number themselv would be the sudden realiz that Appl is inde fallible. A bad quarter is forgivable. A flaw busi model isn't as easili forgotten.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9 a Share10 Clobber Stock to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotTh postHow Much Will Appl Inc.

Why the Apple Inc. A9 is Cheaper to Build than the A8X;3/24/2017;"In a previou column, I offer upmi thoughtsonApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) latest low-cost iPad (market simpli as iPad). In a nutshell, Appl built a much more cost-effect version of it iPad Air 2 to allow it to attack the $329 price point, while at the same time keep a reason margin structure.In that article, discuss how Appl manag to cut cost in go from the iPad Air 2 to the new iPad, I made the follow claim:For example, it use the A9 chip, which is certainli cheaper to produc than the A9X found in the iPad Pro and isalmost certainli cheaper to produc than the older A8X found insid of the iPad Air 2.makeArticleAd();Th former statement (vis-a-vi the A9 and A9X) need littl justification, as the A9X is simpli a more complex version of the A9. However, I feel that the comparison of the A9 and A8X cost structur is someth that' probabl worth justifying, and below, I intend to do just that.Apple' iPad Pro lineup. Imag source: Apple.Understand what drive chip costsIn veri basic terms, there are a few major factor that drive chip costs. The first is the cost of silicon wafer -- thi larg depend on their manufactur costs, and the profit margin that the contract chipmak sell the wafer is hope for. Typically, the more advanc a manufactur technology, the more expens the underli silicon wafer are.Th next is chip size: All other thing be equal, a larger chip is more expens to build than a smaller chip. Thi is becaus in such a scenario, silicon-waf size and cost are fixed, mean that for a given wafer cost, a chipmak can produc fewer total chips. Not onli that, but yield rate of larger chip -- again, all els be equal -- are lower than yield rate of smaller chip (here' a discuss of theeconom of silicon wafers).Appli thi to A8X vs. A9Th Appl A8X is manufactur usingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company's(NYSE: TSM) 20-nanomet manufactur technology. The A9 is sourc from both TSMC andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) and is built use their respect 16-nanomet and 14-nanomet technologies.Th A8X chip measur in at 128 squar millimeters; the Samsung-built A9 come in at 96 squar millimeters, and the TSMC-built A10 measur 104.5 squar millimeters.Th 14/16-nanomet technolog upon which the A9 is built should be a bit more expens than the one use to build the A8X (the ""16-nanometer"" technolog use here can be thought of as simpli a more advanc variant of the 20-nanometer, rather than an all-new technology), but the much larger die size of the A8X, rel to either A9, more than like offset the slight extra cost associ with the 14/16-nanomet technologies.Th A9 is cheaper and betterTh nice thing about Apple' choic of the A9 for the low-cost iPad is that it' not onli probabl cheaper to manufactur than the A8X, but it' also a genuin better processor. The A9 ha faster processor core than the A8X doe (though the A9 ha two and the A8X ha three) and, per the3DMark Ice Storm graphic perform test, a faster graphic processor than the A8X offers.I believ that the perform and user experi that the new iPad should deliv with the A9 will be superior to what a hypothet low-cost iPad with an A8X could have delivered.Talk about a win-win!10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. Samsung;3/23/2017;"Welcom to the consum electron equival of an Ali-Frazi fight. To consid just one area where they compete,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) so domin the smartphon and tablet busi that between them, the two tech giant regularli account for more than 90% of smartphon industri profit in ani given quarter. Clearly, these are powerhouses.A to which is the better buy today, the answer is far less clear. Thi articl will run Samsung and Appl through a three-part analysi to gaug which tech company' share look like the better invest right now.Imag Source: SamsungmakeArticleAd();Financi fortitudeTh Ali-Frazi analog certainli hold true in the financi analysi of these two famous profit companies. To give thi discuss some color, here a quick review of some of the most import solvenc and liquid metric for Appl and Samsung.CompanyCash & InvestmentsDebtsCash from OperationsCurr RatioApple$246.1 billion$87.5 billion$65.4 billion1.2Samsung$76.8 billion$13.3 billion$41.3 billion2.6Data source: Appl investor relat , Yahoo! FinanceA you can see, both compani are paragon of financi stability. However, as ha receiv plenti of attent in recent years, the bulk of Apple' current cash and invest resid in oversea accounts; it report have $230 billion oversea in it most recent Form 10-Q. Appl ha adeptlyborrow againstthat debt to fund it variou capit return efforts, but Samsung doe not face such an issue. Regardless, Appl enjoy substanti more net cash and produc over $20 billion more cash from it oper than Samsung. So while neither compani is a pauper, Appl earn a win in thi first category.Winner:AppleDur competit advantagesGiven that they are two of the largest and most power compani in the world, it take no grand insight to see that both Appl and Samsung enjoy competit advantag to vari degrees.Apple' cash hoard is it owncompetit advantage, give it unparallel flexibl to pursu whatev potenti strateg goal it desires. Apple' largest sourc of stay power, though, is it closed-loop ecosystem, which is buttress in equal degre by it lead hardwar design, iO software, app ecosystem, and prize brand. In combination, these factor allow Appl to command far higher price for it devic than most other consum electron manufactur do for similar equipment.Thes higher per-unit price translat into above-averag margin for Apple. As just one example, the Mac maker produc a net incom margin of 20.7% over the past 12 months, more than twice theS&P 500' averag profit margin accord toFactSetdata. However, Apple' success also rest on it abil to consist creat and market sleek devic that consum love. Though it ha yet to have a stumbl on that front in the iPhon era, failur to execut it well-worn playbook in ani given year could advers affect the company' financi perform and stock price.A one of the largest electron maker in the world, Samsung should be abl to maintain it place atop of the global tech industri over the long term. The compani oper three main report segments: consum electron (TVs, appliances, etc.), IT & mobil commun (smartphones), and devic solut (semiconductor and displays). Consum electron and IT & mobil produc oper margin of roughli 5% and 10% respect in 2016; call them averag to below-averag busi base on the FactSet profit margin number cite earlier. However, Samsung' semiconductor unit, which design and manufactur a host of chip for itself and other electron firms, is the financi engin that power it performance; the unit produc 20% oper margin in 2016.In the categori of near-term risks, Samsung' place in South Korea' grow polit corrupt scandal creat someth of an overhang for thechaebol, the Korean word for the hand of larg conglomer that domin the busi landscap in the East Asian country. Last month, Samsung CEO Jay Y. Lee wa arrest and will be indict on charg includ ""bribery, embezzlement, hide asset oversea and perjury"" as part of the investig that lead to South Korean presid Park Geun-hye' impeachment. In all likelihood, thi shouldn't damag Samsung' long-term busi outlook, though it certainli could creat issu for the compani and it manag structur in the come quarters.Winner:AppleImag source: AppleValuationTurn the final segment of our analysis, let' take a look at three of the most popular valuat metric for the two companies.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAApple16.913.910.9Samsung13.59.54.6Data source: Yahoo Financ , S&P Global Market IntelligenceImportantly, Apple' massiv hoard of cash and investmentsartifici inflatesit valuation. As I recent point out, subtract Apple' net cash and invest from it market capit actual lower Apple' current P/E ratio to around 12.5, depend on Apple' current stock price. Know that Appl is cheaper than Samsung and enjoy superior econom to the South Korean powerhous -- see the durabl competit advantag section abov -- total refram thi discuss in Apple' favor.Befor wrap up thi section, it' also worth mention that both Appl and Samsung are materi undervalu compar to the market averages; the S&P 500 current trade at a pricey 26-time earnings. So though Appl earn a win in thi section, both compani appear at least somewhat under-priced.Winner:AppleAnd the winner is... AppleBi virtu of win all three segments, Appl earn itself an easi win in comparison to Samsung. That isn't to say Samsung isn't an interest invest as one of the strongest compani in all of tech, especi when take it rock-bottom valuat into consideration.

Why Apple Inc. Is So Profitable;3/23/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the world' most profit compani and certainli the most profit smartphon maker. Per Strategi Analyt (bi way ofMacRumors), Appl captur 79% of all smartphon industri profit in 2016, while rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) took in 14.6% (leav veri littl for the mani remain industri players).What isn't often talk about -- even in the financi media -- iswhyApple' iPhon franchis (and, indeed, Appl itself) is so incred profitable.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();I think thi is an import topic for investors, and even simpli individu interest in the smartphon business, to understand. To that end, I'd like to explain.How are profit calculated?Ther are sever type of profit, or income, that you should be awar of. There' gross profit, oper profit, and net profit.Gross profit refer to the amount of money that the compani get to keep from the sale of each product after cost of good sold -- think of that as the per unit product cost -- is subtract from the sell price of the product.A concret example: if I sell a smartphon for $150 that cost me $100 to make, then my gross profit is $50. My gross profit margin percentag in thi case is the ratio of gross profit ($50) to sell price ($150), or 33%.You'll notic that while gross profit is an interest metric, it doesn't consid anoth critic financi factor: oper expenses. A compani like Appl must constantli invest in research and develop to bring new product into the world and there are other expens such as product marketing, administr functions, and so on.Oper profit, then, can be thought of as gross profit less oper expenses.Finally, there' net profit. You can think of thi as oper profit with some other factor bake in includ tax liabilities, losses/gain from investments, one-tim account charges, and so on.With that background in mind, we can now understand whi Appl is so profitable.High revenue, solid gross profit margins, and rel low oper expensesIn it last fiscal year, Appl report net revenu of $215.64 billion -- a substanti sum. On that revenue, it gener gross profit of $84.26 billion. It oper expenses, split between research and develop (R&D) and sales, general, and administr (SG&A), total $24.24 billion.A a simpl calcul shows, Appl gener $60 billion in oper incom and, less tax and includ in ""other income,"" it net incom work out to $45.69 billion.From these numbers, the key to Apple' profit is clear: extrem high revenues, a robust gross profit margin percentag on that revenue, and rel low oper expens as a percentag of revenu (enabl in no small part by the fact that it revenu base is so huge).What' particularli impress is that the compani is abl to move north of $200 billion in product with an SG&A budget of just shi of $14.2 billion.In contrast, Appl rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) gener roughli $179 billion in total revenu last year (it' worth note that Samsung' busi is more diversifi than Apple's) but it need to spend roughli $47 billion in SG&A to get to that level of revenue.In other words, Apple' sale and market organ iseffectiveand it brand so power that Appl can spend a fraction of what it fiercest competitor doe and still gener more revenue.Apple' a well-run businessOn thing is crystal clear: Appl is a phenomen run busi that get a lot of mileag from it oper expenses. It abil to build desir product and effect market them in such an effici manner is highli impress and, should Appl keep it up, could serv to gener addit sharehold valu in the future.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Chipmaker Could Benefit From Qualcomm, Inc.'s Data Center Assault;3/17/2017;"Wireless chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is make a pretti big push into the market for data center chips. Data center chip aren't sold in anywher near the volum that Qualcomm' bread-and-butt smartphon processor are, but the potenti averag sell price as well as gross profit margin potenti per chip are quit a bit better than a typic smartphon processor.Qualcomm ha said that it Centriq 2400 server chip, which pack 48 of the company' Falkor processor cores, is manufactur on a foundri 10-nanomet processor. Qualcomm hasn't specifi which of the two compani current in product on 10-nanomet technolog --Taiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) -- is build the chip, but thank to a report from DigiTimes, we know who the winner is.Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();And the winner is...PerDigiTimes, cite a report from Commerci Times, say that it' Taiwan Semi that' build the Centriq 2400 for Qualcomm. In fact, not onli is TSMCsetto build the Centriq 2400 for Qualcomm, but the report say that the chip are in mass product now.Thi might come as a bit of a surpris to some consid that Qualcomm is have Samsung build it 10-nanomet Snapdragon 835 smartphon chips, but perhap the fact that Qualcomm isn't tri to sell these chip to Samsung may have given it a bit more liberti when decid which manufactur to work with on the Centriq 2400.Near-term and longer-term implicationsIn the near term, I don't see the Centriq 2400 drive game-chang level of chip volum or, ultimately, revenu into TSMC' coffers, although increment leading-edg technolog revenu and wafer shipment are alway good. As Iwrot previously, I expect that it'll take time for Qualcomm to take signific share in the data center market, if it ultim doe so.Ov the longer term, TSMC could be one of the prime beneficiari should the ARM server ecosystem -- of which Qualcomm is a veri promin member -- take the kind of server share that ARM had told it investor (back when it wa a publicli trade company) it aspir to take (roughli 25% of the market).Indeed, TSMC ha been consist highlight ""high-perform computing"" (HPC) applic as attract long-term growth opportun beyond the core mobil chip market. Such market demand perform and features, which mean that potenti custom are like to be more will to pay up to use TSMC' most advanc manufactur technologies.TSMC will, of course, face indirect competit from microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , the incumb player in the data center processor market and a compani that manufactur it own chip, and it will need to deal with rival contract chip manufacturerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) for chip order from the design of these chip for HPC applications.However, TSMC' success in the high end of the mobil applic processor market, it strong technolog execution, as well as it histori as the key manufactur of FPGA, graphics, and network processor chip for other client, should posit it well to captur ARM server processor business.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Cypress Semiconductor Could Benefit From the Next iPhone;3/17/2017;"Imag source: Cypress Semiconductor.makeArticleAd();Cypress Semiconductor(NASDAQ: CY) share have gain more than 17% thi year thank mostli to strong fourth-quarterresultsreleas in earli February, with the semiconductor specialist trade close to it 52-week high as of thi writing.Cypress, however, is not done yet, as recent rumor regardingApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) next iPhon suggest that it busi could get a big shot in the arm.A design win would be a big dealTh Wall Street Journalha report that insid said Appl is go to ditch the Lightn connector for a USB-C port in the next iPhone. Though there is a preced for the compani use USB-C in the MacBook line, well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believ otherwise. The KGI Secur analyst reportedli said in a research note obtain byAppleInsiderthat Appl could use ""Type-C power delivery"" for all the upcom iPhon thi year instead of ditch the Lightn port altogeth in favor of USB-C.It make sens for Appl to use Type-C power deliveri through the exist Lightn port instead of move to the USB-C standard, as the former is good enough to enabl fast-charg on the iPhone. The addit advantag of use USB-C is high-spe data transmission, but Kuo point out that thi is a nich applic for iPhon users, so he think Appl will stick to the exist standard.Additionally, Kuo' comment seem credibl becaus Appl ha a whole line of Lightn accessori under the MFi program on which it make money. The compani reportedli get a fee of around 10% of the wholesal cost of an accessori made under thi program. For example, an Apple-certifi Lightn to USB cabl cost around $6 at the minimum, so, that would give Appl 60 cent on the sale of each unit.But whatev the case may be, the next iPhon look to be a catalyst for Cypress. Invest research provid Needham & Compani estim that the semiconductor specialist' earn could increas by $0.11 to $0.19 per share on revenu gain of $87.5 million to $157.5 million dure the next iPhon cycl if Appl ditch Lightn for a USB-C port. By comparison, Cypress' adjust earn last quarter were $0.15 per share on revenu of $530 million.Even if Appl decid to continu use the Lightn port with Type-C power delivery, Kuo believ that Cypress will win a spot to suppli power deliveri chip to enabl thi technology. Cypress is a lead provid of Type-C control with $295 million worth of design win in thi market, so it could be on it way to take advantag of the next iPhone' upgrad charg technology.Cypress previou suppli onli compon for Appl accessories, such as a programm chip for the AirPods. Therefore, a spot in the next iPhon would be a big win for it as the Cupertino-bas smartphon giant is expect to make 250 million to 350 million unit of the device.Moreover, a closer look at the company' fourth-quart confer call transcript (viaSeek Alpha) reveal that Cypress might be gear up for the iPhon product ramp-up in the second half of the year. In respons to a question, Cypress CEO Hassan El-Khouri said:But if you look at the market for Type-C, the expect from my side is, that ramp is go to happen in the second half of 2017, and that' realli a typic design-in behavior. So we will see slight growth in the March quarter, but primarili would expect us to grow much harder in the second half.A potenti Galaxi S8 bonusAppl might not be the onli one drive growth in Cypress' Type-C controllers. Needham expect theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi S8 to come equip with USB-C charg capabilities. Thi isn't surpris as thi charg standard is fast replac the micro USB in Android smartphones.Leak imag of the Galaxi S8 indic that the Korean smartphon will inde come with a USB-C port and Cypress ha been a longtim compon supplier to Samsung, so a USB-C port win in the next flagship devic is quit likely.A thing stand, Needham expect Samsung to sell somewher between 30 million and 60 million Galaxi S8 devices, with Cypress get dollar content of $1 to $1.50 in each phone. Thi put it potenti revenu from the next Samsung flagship in the rang of $30 million to $90 million, with earn come in between $0.04 and $0.10 per share.Cypress Semiconductor seem on track for two big smartphon design win thi year that could substanti enhanc it financi performance.10 stock we like better than Cypress SemiconductorWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If it can maintain thi rate, it will easili pull a repeat of 2016' incred run.Of course, that' a bigif, but the fundament are supportive.

Unlik old western movies, thi town is more than big enough for all of them, at least for now.Th question now is, when the next big headwind come storm in, will Micron stock be ready? More pointedly, will investor stay patient enough to find out?Ling Doubt Exist for Micron stockA great as the MU stock ralli wa last year, it doesn't complet eras the miseri of 2015. A 59% loss in the market requir a 144% profit to breakeven. The quick math work out like this: 100% ÷ (100% - 59%).7 Dividend Stock With Yield That Grow Like WeedsA mention before, Micron stock manag 53% in 2016, which is obvious well off the breakeven point.

Now the averag haul is a veri encourag 32%. Still, investor have had to go on a ride to get their share of the glory. What bull and bear can agre on is that MU stock is not a stock for the squeamish.Finally, a split dynam in thederiv marketha left semiconductor trader on tenuou ground.

However, that doesn't mean it will stay that way.MU Stock Will Look More ConvincingFirst, I think potenti buyer should take a small bit of encourag from the option traders. Yes, big semiconductor are split evenli in term of sentiment. However, they collect chose Micron as belong to the better half of the equation. Sinc option trader typic have their finger on the trigger, it' safe to assum that they absorb the latest news with aggress vigor.Do the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacl Signal Doom for These Unicorns?On the other hand, trader can be wrong, and sometimes, pain so. That' whi I like to see if there are confirm fundamentals. In MU' last earn report, the compani return to profit after three consecut quarter of droughts. More importantly, Micron stock receiv an upgrad by Zack Invest Research to a ""strong buy."" Thi shift wa due to a sizabl lift in earnings-per-shar expectations.But the biggest draw for MU stock is it technic trend line. Sinc Novemb of last year, share have chart a distinct pattern of higher high and higher lows. Thi pattern ha also occur abov Micron stock' 50- and 200-day move averages. No sign of weak exists, apart from the daili ebb and flow of market trading.Th real test for Micron will come when it releas it second-quart result next week. But given the technic enthusiasm for MU, as well as the company' own expectations, I think anyth other than a long play is a riski one.

Those chip are expect to be manufactur in TSMC' new 10-nanomet manufactur technology.However, a new report from Korean public ETNew claim that Samsung is ""expect that it can recov Apple' foundri suppli that were taken by Taiwan' TSMC by oper 7-nano product lines.""Samsung' appar hunger to win back busi from TSMC is a clear risk to the latter.A12 probabl isn't at risk, but what about A13?Samsung went into mass product on it 10-nanomet LPE in the fourth quarter of 2016 and ha publicli said that it expect to begin volum product of the follow-on to thi technology, known as 10-nanomet LPP, in the fourth quarter of 2017.Samsung ha said that it aim to begin mass product of it 7-nanomet technolog in 2018, and given the schedul around 10-nanomet LPE/LPP, I'd guess that Samsung is aim forlate2018 product start for it 7-nanomet technology.What thi suggest is this: TSMC is unlik to be at risk of lose A12 busi to Samsung as the latter' 7-nanomet technolog will be too late to market to support the A12, while TSMC ha indic that it plan to begin mass product on it 7-nanomet technolog in the first half of 2018.It' the potenti A13 busi that could be at risk from an aggress push from Samsung.Don't count TSMC out, thoughSamsung seem to be plan some aggress technic move with it 7-nanomet technolog -- it'sreportedli planningto move to a new transistor structur call a Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor that promis to allow chipmak to continu to make transistor smaller.However, TSMC ha indic that in 2019 it intend to roll out a performance-enhanc variant of it 7-nanomet technology.Ther are a lot of factor that will drive Apple' decis of where it plan to manufactur it next-gener A-seri processor -- both busi and technic -- so tri to guess where Appl will build it next-gener processor is difficult.It' worth noting, though, that TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu said on the company' Q3 2016 earn call that he expect TSMC' market share dure the 7-nanomet technolog gener will be ""higher than 10-nanometer"" and that TSMC' aim is for each new manufactur technolog to enjoy higher market share than the prior-gener technology.It'd be hard for TSMC to achiev higher market share in the 7-nanomet gener rel to the 10-nanomet gener if it end up lose a signific portion of Apple' busi to Samsung. Thi lead me to believ that TSMC is confid that it can maintain it sole-sourc posit at Apple, but onli time will tell if that confid is deserved.10 stock we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Apple Should Be Scared of This Company;3/12/2017;"Imag source: Getti Images.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) reign at the top of the smartphon market is under threat. Slowli but steadily, Chines telecom giant Huawei ha been spread it wing across key global markets, in a bid to displac Appl and Samsung from the top of the smartphon heap.makeArticleAd();Huawei' ambit of becom the second-largest smartphon compani in the world receiv a shot in the arm in 2016, as it smartphon sale increas close to 27% from the year before. In stark contrast, both Apple' and Samsung' shipment fell 4.3% over the same period, accord toGartner. The strong growth in shipment gave Huawei 8.9% of the smartphon market in 2016 compar to 7.3% a year ago.Bi comparison, the market share of both Appl and Samsung took a beating. The Cupertino-bas smartphon giant' share of the market fell by 1.5 percentag point to 14.4%, while Samsung' market share fell by two percentag point to 20.5%. Huawei, however, ha manag to consist increas it smartphon shipments, lead to market-shar gains:Data sources: Strategi Analyt and Counterpoint Technolog Market Research. Chart by author.Hav alreadi occupi the third place in the smartphon race, the Chines vendor will now go all out to achiev it lofti ambitions. In Novemb 2016, the chief execut of Huawei' consum busi group told Reuter that it want to becom the second-largest smartphon compani in two years. But will it be abl to meet thi aggress target?China and India will be tailwind for HuaweiTh Chines compani ha been seek growth in it home market. Last year, Huawei ship 76.6 million phone in China and sat in the second place with a market share of 16.4%. Meanwhile, Apple' Chines shipment drop an alarm 23% to 44.9 million units, give it a single-digit market share of just 9.6%.Thi mean that Huawei ha open a huge gap over Appl in China, as it smartphon shipment there are up almost 22% in 2016. China will be the key to Huawei' global smartphon dominance, sinc it is the world' biggest smartphon market and account for 21% of global shipment last year.What' more, the grow adopt of LTE connect in China mean that smartphon demand in the countri will remain strong. GSMA Intellig forecast that China will have 1 billion 4G connect by 2020, compar to 762 million at the end of 2016. The increas adopt of 4G mean that custom will need toupgrad to smartphonesfrom featur phone as they move away from legaci technolog such as 2G and 3G.On the other hand, Huawei is also look to make inroad into the Indian market. Last year, it said that it aim to have 10% of the Indian smartphon market by the end of 2017. In fact, Huawei' Indian consum oper report directli to the Chines headquarters, show the compani recogn the import of thi market.Thi is not surpris as annual smartphon sale in India are expect to top 200 million unit in 2020 (rise from 102 million unit last year), make it the world' second-largest market. If Huawei manag to carv out a 10% share for itself in India, it can add 20 million unit in smartphon sales.Thi look like an uphil task sinc it had just 0.5% of the Indian market in the first half of 2016. But in Septemb 2016, Huawei began it smartphon manufactur oper in India, and it plan to manufactur 3 million unit by the end of 2017. If it is abl to convert all these unit into sale thi year, the company' Indian market share will gain respectability.Bi comparison, Appl is yet to get it manufactur oper in India into full swing. Though it manufactur partner Wistron ha set up a plant in the southern part of the country, it will onli produc around 300,000 to 400,000 unit of the iPhon SE initially. Thi is a far cri from Huawei' manufactur capacity.Th secret behind Huawei' growthHuawei ha a smart formula to win over custom in big smartphon market -- offlin sales. In China, Huawei plan to set up 1,000 store across all counties, apart from strike partnership with distributor and retailers. It also plan to deploy 460 servic store in 45 nations.Meanwhile, Huawei ha partner with more than 50,000 retail outlet in India and is go to set up more than 200 servic centers. The company' offline-stor strategi for emerg market is a smart one, allow it to gain more eyebal and eventu increas sales.In fact, offlin sale in market such as India have been the key to the success of Chines smartphon companies, sinc custom have been abl to touch and feel their phone befor buying. And, just 35% of the Indian popul had access to the internet last year, which could be anoth reason that Huawei ha been busi open retail outlet in smaller cities.A similar scenario is unfold in China, where offlin smartphon sale are gain momentum. The grow shift toward offlin smartphon sale ha encourag Huawei to drastic ramp up it company-own stores.Huawei had bump it global store count by 116% to 35,000 toward the end of May 2016. The compani ha further strengthen it retail presenc as it plan to open anoth 15,000 store in 2016 itself. Around half of it store are on the Chines mainland and across the rest of Asia, with the next-largest fraction in Europe.Bi comparison, Appl ha 491 store spread across the globe, and over half of them are in the U.S. What' more, it store presenc in market such as India and China is neglig compar to Huawei's. Appl reportedli had 40 store in China by the end of June 2016, when Huawei had over 11,000 store on the mainland. On the other hand, Apple' plan to open store in India have been slow by regulations, though it might open up three of them thi year.Huawei' strong retail presenc is complement by the company' strategi of offer both budget and premium smartphones. The Honor 5C, which some review count among the top budget phones, cost less than $170 in India at current exchang rates, place it way below the global-averag smartphon price of $256.In fact, Huawei also sell featur phone in emerg market that cost less than $100. These budget phone help bring custom to it store and improv brand awareness. The compani is now gradual move into the higher segment of the market by launch more mid-rang and premium phones, which should eventu improv the averag sell price of it phones.Imag source: Huawei.Th takeawayA strong retail presenc and an extens product portfolio that cover all segment of the smartphon market have been the catalyst behind Huawei' growth. In fact, the company' two-prong strategi ha put it in the limelight, as the valu of it brand grew 28% in 2016 on the back of high-end devic and market campaigns.Appl and Samsung, therefore, have a fierc competitor that look capabl of break into the top two in the smartphon market.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Hewlett-Packard Company;3/12/2017;"WhenHP(NYSE: HPQ) split withHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) in late 2015, the former seem more like a slower-growth incom play than the latter. But over the past 12 months, HP share ralli 55%, outperform HPE' 46% growth and the S&P 500' 18% gain.In aprevi article, I highlight the way HP evolv it age PC busi while scale up and diversifi it print one. Today, we'll look at the key growth driver for HP, and see whi the 78-year-old company' best day could still be ahead.HP' Spectr laptop. Imag source: HP.makeArticleAd();1. PC declin have like bottomedIn January,Gartnerannounc that worldwid PC shipment fell for the fifth consecut year in 2016. That wa sour news for PC vendor like HP, but Gartner expect sale to be nearli flat thi year and rise in 2018 -- indic that the market ha final bottom out.That' becaus sale of premium ""ultramobile"" devic -- like Ultrabooks, Macbooks, and 2-in-1 devic -- are expect to rise and offset declin in ""traditional"" PC like desktop and regular notebooks. HP' most recent quarterli report, which show Person System (PC) revenu rise 10% annual to $8.2 billion, reflect that shift -- desktop sale stay flat, but notebook sale rose 16% on strong demand for higher-end convertibles, detachables, and thinner devices. Look further ahead,th busi could gain anoth tailwind from rise demand for VR-readi desktop and notebooks.2. It' scale up it print businessLast November, HP announc that it would acquireSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) print business. That move will help HP use economi of scale to lower product costs, and is expect to becom accret in the first full year after the deal closes. HP also believ that combin the two companies' technolog will ""reinvent and replac service-intens copi with superior multi-funct printing.""HP' print busi didn't look great last quarter. Total print revenu fell 3% annual to $4.5 billion, due to an 8% declin in commerci hardwar (exacerb by some product be shift to the consum business) and a 3% drop in suppli sales. However, consum hardwar sale improv 2% -- thank to healthi demand for it Sprocket mobil printer.HP' Sprocket mobil printer. Imag source: HP.HP' commerci print busi could also perk up onc it instal more high-end 3D printer for enterpris customers. It ship it first Multi Jet Fusion printer to Jabil, Materialise, and Shapeway dure the quarter, and CEO Dion Weisler note dure the confer call that HP wa track that progress ""to disrupt the $12 trillion tradit manufactur market."" Those new investments, along with the Samsung acquisition, could consider strengthen HP' print busi over the next few years.3. It' all about the bundlesOn of HP' biggest advantag in the enterpris market is it abil to bundl product togeth at competit prices. Last quarter, HP form new partnership with glass and ceram makerCorningand pharmaceut giantRoche, both of which now use ""comprehensive"" packag of HP' notebooks, desktops, and workstations. HP could eventu add 3D printer to those bundl for custom across the manufactur industry.A enterpris spend warm up again, HP could sell more bundl to big enterpris custom -- which would strengthen both it PC and print businesses.4. The stock is cheap, and the compani reward it shareholdersHP trade at 12 time earnings, which is well below it industri averag of 20. It also trade at 0.6 time sales, which is also much lower than the industri averag of 0.9. HP also pay a forward dividend yield of 3.1%, which is comfort support by a payout ratio of 33%. That combin of a stabl business, low multiple, and high yield make HP veri appeal in a market fill with overvalueddividend stocks.HP also clearli intend to return most of it free cash flow to shareholders. Last quarter, it gener over $700 million in FCF and spent more than $600 million on buyback and dividends. Those move can boost it earnings, keep valuat low, and attract addit incom investors.Th key takeawayTh ""new"" HP is definit leaner and more focus than the old one, which includ too mani move part which frequent cancel out each others' gains. Therefore, I believ that HP' renew effort in the PC and print market could make it a great long-term play at current prices. The stock probabl won't soar anytim soon, but it low valuat and solid dividend make it a sound invest for conserv investors.10 stock we like better than HPWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

They have ask us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""Th WikiLeak Vault 7 releas made it clear that iO wasn't as secur as Appl had thought.How Appl Could Come Out AheadWikiLeak is bad news for Appl in the short term.

Appl quickli went on record as say mani of the vulner identifi in the WikiLeak Vault 7 documentswer alreadi address with iO 10.

Appl control everi aspect of iO - it mobil oper system - as well as the hardware. It push out new major new iO version yearli and updat releas (the kind that fix bug or secur issues) on demand. As a result,nearli 80% of all iPhon are current run iO 10.Googl also releas new version of Android yearly, but larg reli on smartphon manufactur and wireless carrier to approv and push updates. They have littl incent to do so, sinc lack the latest Android featur could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildli vari assort of smartphones, updat can often be problematic, lead to support issues.

Most iPhon users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assur that Apple' consist program of releas will address ani outstand issues.Appl ha a similar approach with macOS.

Qualcomm could leverag that technology, coupl with architectur enhancements, to build a compel next-gener premium Snapdragon chip.At the same time, though, TSMC' upcom 7-nanomet offer -- which is expect to go into risk product soon (if it hasn't gone into it already) -- should go into product in the first half of 2018. Thi 7-nanomet technolog promis a perform bump from TSMC' 10-nanomet technolog (and potenti Samsung's, assum TSMC' and Samsung' 10-nanomet technolog offer compar performance) as well as an area reduction.If Qualcomm break for TSMC for the 7-nanomet technolog generation, then that could mean a nice revenu boost for the latter as Qualcomm' premium smartphon chip volum are quit significant. However, I wouldn't be surpris to see Qualcomm stick with Samsung' manufactur technolog given that Samsung is a signific buyer of Qualcomm' premium chips.In the case that Qualcomm doe opt to stay with Samsung in come premium smartphon chip generations, TSMC might view MediaTek as an import strateg partner with whom it can regain premium Android smartphon chip share.Aft all, if Qualcomm' flagship Snapdragon chip are all manufactur by Samsung, and sinc Qualcomm domin the premium smartphon chip market, TSMC' onli way to regain share in that segment are the following:Collabor with smartphon vendor that design their own chip for premium flagship devic that compet with Qualcomm power flagship (i.e. iPhone) and,Shar gain on the part of merchant chip competitor that work with TSMC to manufactur their chips.TSMC ha done a good job with the first (it build chip for the iPhone, Huawei' premium smartphones, and even Xiaomi' first in-hous chip), but it ha limit control over the second.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Winners From the Nintendo Switch Teardown;3/8/2017;"Struggl game giantNintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) recent releas it next-gen game platform, known as the Nintendo Switch.

However, should the product ultim perform well, here are three supplier -- reveal in iFixit' recent teardown of a Nintendo Switch -- that could potenti benefit.Imag source: Nintendo.makeArticleAd();Th brain of the Nintendo Switch come from...Th biggest potenti winner from the Switch is graphic specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) . NVIDIA ha done extrem well for itself in the lucr market for stand-alon graphic processor target at game person computers, but it ha been larg absent from the game consol market for quit some time.Insid of the Nintendo Switch is an applic processor develop by NVIDIA. Not too much is known about the chip itself (though it is said to be a deriv of the company' Tegra X1 processor), but for everi Nintendo Switch that get sold, NVIDIA will gener some revenu and, presumably, a reason amount of gross profit.Though a more extens teardown will be requir to verifi the following,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Companymay also be a winner here as it is like the contract chip manufactur for the NVIDIA chip design (sinc the Tegra X1 is manufactur by TSMC). A teardown of the chip itself by the like of Chipwork will be requir to confirm this, though.Memori sourc from South KoreaTh iFixit teardown show that the Nintendo Switch includ DRAM -- that is, the main system memori -- built by South Korean memori giantSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Now, the Switch appar come with two 2-gigabyt memori chip for a total of 4 gigabyt of modern LPDDR4 memory. LPDDR4 is the memori type current in use in premium smartphones, and high-end smartphon these day have between 2 and 6 gigabytes, so the memori content insid of the Nintendo Switch is essenti equival to that of a reason high-end smartphone.Thi is by no mean a game-chang win for Samsung, which gener 34.29 trillion Korean won (equival to about $30 billion in U.S. dollars) in memori revenu (thi includ both DRAM and NAND flash), but everi bit helps.Would the real Wi-Fi supplier stand up?Th iFixit teardown show that the Wi-Fi chip is a chip known as the BCM4356. The chip' part number indic that it' aBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) chip design, but iFixit list it as a Broadcom/Cypress Semiconductor(NASDAQ: CY) part.A it turn out, the BCM4356 wa part of Broadcom' Internet of Thing (IoT) lineup. Broadcom sold it IoT busi to Cypress Semiconductor in the middl of last year, so it' not Broadcom that get the win here -- it' Cypress Semiconductor.Bi way of reference, though the chip wa call the BCM4356 by Broadcom, it ha been rebrand as the CYW4356 by Cypress.When the transact to sell Broadcom' IoT busi to Cypress wa announced, the compani said that thi busi unit ""gener $189 million in revenu dure the last twelv months.""If Cypress is sell these chip to Nintendo for perhap $5-$10 a piece, then signific Nintendo Switch unit shipment could translat into real revenu growth for thi business.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock market took note of Cirru Logic' weak outlook and it sharesdrop 14% the next day.makeArticleAd();Th problem is that Cirrus' revenu is highli depend on the iPhon product cycle, which is like put all your egg in one basket. If Appl doe not increas Cirrus' content in it phone or cut it product volumes, the latter' financi perform get sever impacted. Appl is not expect to bring ani new Cirru technolog into it next iPhone.No increas in chip content at Appl is go to hurt Cirrus' revenu growth. Consensu estim indic that it revenu will grow onli 6.5% in fiscal year 2018 as compar to estim gain of 31% in the current fiscal year.Cirru need the power of diversif in order to sustain it strong revenu growth and avoid Apple-rel fluctuations. The good news for Cirru investor is that there are two key technolog that could help it diversifi not just in smartphon but into other industri as well.Voic biometr will be a big dealCirrus' research in voic biometr will play a major role in it push to diversifi itself as thi technology, which allow peopl to interact with their devic via voice, will find applic in a varieti of fields. Voic biometr ha sever use cases, rang from connect car to smart home to the Internet of Things. The technolog is also gain traction in the field of bank and financi servic for user authentication.Infin Research forecast that the voic recognit biometr market will grow at an annual pace of almost 19.4% from 2017 to 2021. Thi is close to the 22.9% annual growth expect by Tractica in the overal biometr market, which includ other sub-seg such as facial, fingerprint, and iri recognition.In all, the total biometr market is expect to be worth $15.1 billion by 2025, accord to Tractica, and voic recognit stand to be an import pillar of it growth due to it applic across industries. Banks, for instance, are increasingli deploy voic biometrics. BothBarclaysandHSBCstart use voic recognit to secur identifi custom last year.What' more, the adopt of voic biometr in mobil devic is also expect to pick up pace go forward. Appl itself file a patent last Februari relat to voice-recognition-bas authentication. Apple' patent file say that:A devic can be configur to receiv speech input from a user. The speech input can includ a command for access a restrict featur of the device. The speech input can be compar to a voiceprint (e.g., text-independ voiceprint) of the user' voic to authent the user to the device.Cirru can capit on the possibl of Appl deploy voic biometr in it futur phone as it is all set to ""tape out"" it first compon in 2017. Cirru manag say that the compani will start sampl it voice-biometrics-en compon in the quarter that run Juli Septemb of 2017.Cirru believ that it could start gener revenu from thi technolog after the next fiscal year ends. Therefore, it won't be surpris if Cirrus' growth get back on track after a weak fiscal 2018 onc it launch it voic biometrics-en chips.Act nois cancel is a more immedi catalystTechSci Research forecast that the market for earphon and headphon could surpass $19 billion in revenu over the next five year as smartphon maker tri to deliv a superior audio experi to customers. The use of activ nois cancel (ANC) technolog is one way to deliv an immers audio experience.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , for instance, is expect to sell ANC-en wireless headphon alongsid the upcom Galaxi S8. Samsung believ that the use of ANC will allow it to cut out ambient nois by a maximum of 20 decibel and result in a better audio experience, which will give it a differenti factor against rivals.An immers audio experience, however, will not come cheap as Samsung is expect to charg 130 euro (or $138 approximately) for the headphones. Now, Cirrus' first headset with ANC technolog is expect to be launch soon. As Samsung is one of it customers, it is like that a Cirru chip is power the Korean giant' ANC-en headphone.What' more, Cirru is alreadi in talk with more custom for it ANC headset and seem to have land a few design win already. As the design win materi and the adopt of voic biometr and ANC gain traction, Cirru Logic will find new avenu to augment it growth. Therefore, despit a year of slow growth in fiscal 2018, Cirru Logic' long-term prospect appear to be bright base on the possibl present by these two technologies.10 stock we like better than Cirru LogicWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Potenti iPhon Edit buyer could also shrug and order the iPhon 7s instead, not wish to wait a few month for their new smartphone.

Should Qualcomm Inc. Worry About Xiaomi's New Chips?;3/6/2017;"Mobil chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) and Chines smartphon giantXiaomiar often consid close partners. Qualcomm becam one of Xiaomi' earliest investor in 2011, and all of Xiaomi' flagship devic use Qualcomm chips. When regulatori troubl in China forc Qualcomm to renegoti it licens term with OEMs, Xiaomi wa one of the first compani tosign a new dealwith the chipmaker.However, that allianc gradual weakened. Xiaomi eventu start use moreMediaTek(NASDAQOTH: MDTKF) chip in it cheaper devices, and ongo rumor indic that the compani wa develop first-parti chips. Those rumor were final confirm in late February, when Xiaomi unveil the Surg S1 chip for it new mid-rang Mi 5c smartphone.Xiaomi' Mi5c. Imag source: Xiaomi.makeArticleAd();Th Surg S1 is a 28nm chip with eight cores, four of which run at 2.2GHz with anoth four run at 1.4GHz. It Mali T-860 MP4 GPU is capabl of play 4K videos. Those spec make it slightli more power than Qualcomm' Snapdragon 625, a popular octa-cor processor which power mid-rang devic like the intern variant of Xiaomi' Mi Note 4. The S1 wa produc by Xiaomi' subsidiari Pinecon Electron via a partnership with Chines chipmakerLeadcore.Whi Xiaomi need to make it own chipsBack in 2014, Xiaomi becam the biggest smartphon maker in China. But by the end of 2016, it had drop to fifth place afterOppo,Huawei,Vivo, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in that order. That declin wa caus by competitor flood the market with compar price phones, a shift in consum tast toward pricier devices, and an overal slowdown across the Chines smartphon market.Last November, Xiaomi admit that it core phone busi wasn't profitable. In January, it stop disclos annual shipment figur and abruptli announc that it would skip thi year' Mobil World Congress. Those move all indic that the compani wa struggl to stay afloat in the crowd Chines market.However, Xiaomi also notic that it could follow Apple, Huawei, andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) lead and develop first-parti ARM chips. Produc first-parti chip is a pricey investment, but it' a smart long-term play becaus it reduc Xiaomi' depend on chipmak like Qualcomm, cut product costs, tighten up the suppli chain, and give it full control over the hardwar and the softwar -- which could better optim it devic for Xiaomi' MIUI custom Android OS.Xiaomi' Mi Air Purifier. Imag source: Xiaomi.In addit to lower cost and boost performance, IDC analyst Bryan Ma also note that Xiaomi' first-parti chip could work better with it smart home ecosystem, which alreadi includ air purifiers, bathroom scales, lights, and even rice cookers. Xiaomi could also use it first-parti chip to bypass a ban on MediaTek chip in India, which occur due to a patent disput withEricsson.What thi mean for QualcommXiaomi' introduct of first-parti chip isn't good news for Qualcomm, but there' no indic that Xiaomi will stop use Qualcomm chip altogether. The Mi 5c mere repres the budget devic of it flagship Mi 5 famili -- which includ the origin Mi 5, the Mi 5S, and the Mi 5S Plus. All three of the other Mi 5 devic use Qualcomm chips.Therefore, the Surg S1 could actual hurt MediaTek -- which suppli Xiaomi with chip for variant of it low and mid-rang devic -- instead of Qualcomm. If the Surg S1 becom Xiaomi' offici mid-rang chipset, it could stop use MediaTek chip as Qualcomm chip remain in high-end devices.Qualcomm' Snapdragon could lose it spot in mid-rang devic like the Mi Note 4, but the overal impact on it chipmak busi might be minimal. Xiaomi' global market share is alreadi like below 5%, base on IDC estimates, and could continu fade as Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo launch new devices. SincesomeOppo, Huawei, and Vivo devic use Qualcomm chips, higher sale at those lead brand could easili offset ani design loss at Xiaomi.So should Qualcomm investor be worried?If Xiaomi had reveal the Surg S1 back in 2014, then swap out all Qualcomm chip with it own silicon, I think investor would have been worried. But Xiaomi is mere aim it new chip at the mid-rang market today, and ani loss from Xiaomi could probabl be offset by higher sale of other rival Android devices.Therefore, investor shouldn't consid Xiaomi' announc to be a major blow to Qualcomm on it own. Nonetheless, the overal trend is worrisome, becaus it indic that Qualcomm' chipmak busi -- which post flat year-over-year sale growth last quarter -- will like continu cede market share to first-parti ARM chip for the forese future.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh collaps ofBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) ha been stunning. But in the tech world, such thing do happen with regularity.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrYet BBRi stock is still far from dead. Hey, if anything, it' amaz that the compani ha been abl to recov from have to deal with the onslaught of mega oper likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Let' face it, evenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) couldn't put up success fight. Thi wa certainli a major reason whi CEO Steve Ballmer step aside.But surviv is not enough, of course. So it should be no surpris that - for the past five year - BBRi stock is off about 50%.OK then, what about the future? Might there be a turnaround? Well, right now, it may seem kind of tough to imagine. But then again, thi wa the sentiment for say,Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), a year ago, right?Definitely.7 Telecom Stock That Are High-Yield Money TrapsSo to gaug the potenti opportun of BlackBerri stock, let' take a look at three pro and cons:3 Pro On BBRi StockLeadership: The CEO of BBRY, John Chen, is a proven veteran in the tech industry. Back in 1997, he took the helm ofSybase, which wa struggl againstOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL). But he restructur the oper and redirect the compani toward enterpris mobil and commerce. He would ultim sell Sybas toSAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) for a hefti $5.8 billion.Yet Chen also ha strongtechn chops. Consid that he ha a master' in electr engin from California Institut of Technology. He also got hi first job as an engin withBurroughsin 1979.Reinvention: Transit a compani from hardwar to softwar is no easi feat. But Chen ha definit made lot of progress with thi strategy. In the latest quarter, the revenu from Softwar & Servic came to roughly55% of the total. Oh, and about 80% wa recurring. In all, there were over 3,000 enterpris custom order in the quarter.For Chen, he ha made some savvi acquisitions, such as forEncription,Good TechnologyandAtHoc. And anoth import part of the strategi ha been to outsourc phone development. Thi ha meant fewer distract as well as the opportun to pick-up high-margin licens revenues.Someth else: Chen ha done a good job in leverag some of the long-tim core technolog assets. An exampl of thi is BlackBerri Secure, which is a full-blown suit of mobil enterpris apps.Long-Term Opportunities: BBRi is tri to posit itself to get a share of the embed technolog market, which is see tremend growth from the auto sector. Note that the compani ha BlackBerri QNX, which is a softwar develop platform that provid top-notch secur featur and ha been award the ISO 26262 ASIL D certif for cars. The system is optim to support lead vendor likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD.A a testament to the advantag of QNX, BBRi recent sign an agreement withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) to cover more car models.3 Con On BBRi StockBrand Issues: Back in 2007, BBRi wa the global leader in the fast-grow smartphon market. But the iPhon would quickli end thi dominance. What' more, BBRi made plenti of blunders, such as in term of aw launches.Th result is that the BlackBerri brand is fairli tarnished. Granted, thi mani not seem to matter as much sinc the compani ha move away from the consum market. However, the brand could still be a problem with busi custom as well. Whi use technolog from a compani that seem to have a dicey future?Competition: It' intense. When it come to the secur market, there are mani player that have great offer likeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW) andCheck Point Softwar Technolog Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP).But of course, the market for enterpris mobil solut also ha mani tough operators. Just some includeVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW), MSFT,Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and SAP.And finally, BBRY' offer in the messag categori also must fight against stiff competition, such as withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp, MSFT' Skype, AAPL' iMessag and even Snap Inc's(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat.M&A: For the most part, BBRi seem to be good buyout bait. The company' cost structur ha been streamlined, there are strong technolog asset and a larg custom base.Yet Accord toInvestorPlace.com' Richard Saintvilus: ""It ha becom clear that Chen - who wa brought in to build BlackBerri into an M&A target - ha taken thi compani as far as he can take it. Despit all of the boast the compani ha done about it superior secur capabilities, BBRi stock ha had no M&A suitors, suggest compani likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracl Corpor and other enterprise-focus compani with which BlackBerri ha often been linked, don't care.""Bottom Line On BBRi StockAgain, Chen ha done a great job. Let' face it, BBRi wa a complet mess when he came on board in late 2013.Use Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock to Unlock Free ProfitsH wast littl time with cost cut and outsourc of the phone business. More importantly, he ha invest in area like security, embed system and even the Internet of Thing (IoT).However, despit all this, the fact remain that progress ha been grudging. If anything, it will probabl still take some time - say a year or so - for the chang to have a real impact. In other words, for those look at BBRi stock, it' probabl best not to rush to buy it right now.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand is the author of variou books, includingTax 2017: Save A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Report: Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. and Samsung Facing 10-Nano Yield Issues;3/3/2017;"Contract chip manufacturersTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co.

Let' go over the implic of those yield challenges.Whi are low manufactur yield bad?Manufactur yield refer to the percentag of manufactur chip that both work and meet the perform and power specif mandat by the design. It gener cost a fix amount of money to manufactur a wafer of chips, so the higher the yield rate, the greater the number of chip are produc for a given cost, which mean lower effect per-chip cost.Conversely, low yield rate mean higher costs. Such cost can either be pass on to the customer, the chip manufactur compani itself could eat the costs, or the respons could be shared.Additionally, chipmak put in a certain amount of manufactur capac in anticip of custom demand. If manufactur yield rate are too far below plan, then a custom use the low-yield technolog may not be abl to get ahold of suffici suppli of products.So, low manufactur yield are gener bad for business.Specif impact on TSMC' and Samsung' customersTh lead custom for TSMC' 10-nanomet technolog appear to be MediaTek, which is use thi technolog to manufactur it Helio X30 line of premium smartphon chips. In a statement to Nikkei Asian Review, a MediaTek executivesaidthat the X30 wa ""delay becaus the yield rate of 10 [nanometer] process technolog [from TSMC] ha not yet reach a satisfactori level... and we are a bit stuck on that.""A silver line here is that MediaTek doesn't expect signific adopt of the X30 in premium smartphon (say that it expect the X30 to be use in ""less than 10 smartphon models""), so these yield challeng are unlik to significantli disrupt MediaTek' busi or the busi of it customers.For Samsung and it lead customer, mobil chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , the struggl is more significant. The Samsung Galaxi S8-seri devic that are set to be formal announc later thi month are expect to Samsung' Exyno 8895 for some variant and Qualcomm' Snapdragon 835 in other variants. Both chip are believ to be manufactur by Samsung use it 10-nanomet LPE technology. DigiTim say that Samsung delay the rollout of the Galaxi S8-seri devic due ""unsatisfactori yield rates.""How about the iPhone?Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expect to tap TSMC to manufactur the former' upcom A11 applic processor on the latter' 10-nanomet technology. The bad news is that the yield challeng describ by DigiTim could impact Apple' abil to meet demand for it next-gener iPhones.Th good news is that Apple' next iPhon model aren't expect to launch until the fall, which give both Appl and TSMC addit time to work out the kink on the 10-nanomet technology.Furthermore, some of the yield issu that MediaTek may be see could be relat to it underli chip design rather than onli due to TSMC' technology. In that case, there' a reason chanc that Appl won't face quit the yield problem that MediaTek is appar cope with.10 stock we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

He is certain all 2017 iPhones, includ the iPhon 8, will keep their Lightn port. However, he predict that AAPL is investig the adopt of the USB-C Power Deliveri standard in that Lightn port. Do so would retain compat with Lightn accessories, but with the advantag of much faster wire charg for the new iPhones.5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in MarchKuo also note sever reason whi AAPL would not choos to implement USB-C instead of stay with it proprietari Lightn port, beyond the potenti consum backlash. The compani would be give up revenu from it MFi program that certifi Lightn accessories. And USB-C port are physic larger than Lightn - given AAPL' obsess with make iPhon thinner, switch to a larger port seem unlikely.Whi Ha USB-C Been Such a Flashpoint Issue?Th meresuggestionthat AAPL would ditch the Lightn port in favor of USB-C ha gener a huge number of articl and editori and fill Appl forums. Whi the fanfar over a simpl charg port?Ther are actual two issu at play here.Th first is a sensit to Appl elimin legaci ports. After the compani got rid of the decades-old standard 3.5mm jack on the iPhon 7, there were accus AAPL had done so arbitrarili - mayb to sell more Beat wireless headphones.

Karma….In the fall, Appl releas a new MacBook Pro that had all legaci connect port replac with USB-C. Thi infuri mani long-tim Mac user becaus it meant have to buy adapt and dongl for all their current accessori and peripherals. A switch from Lightn to USB-C would be seen by mani as anoth Appl move done more or less arbitrarily, without consider for the impact it may have on customers.On the other side of the equation, there are also mani Appl fan who would love to see the compani ditch the proprietari Lightn port for USB-C, which is becom an industri standard.Snap Inc.

These peopl were excit to see theWal Street Journal'spredictionthat AAPL would make the big move.So Where Are We Now on the iPhon 8 Lightn Port?A usual, no one know for certain what AAPL' plan are. I tend to side with the analyst who are suggest that Appl isn't about to court controversi with such a critic iPhon release, and will keep the Lightn port but mayb pack in a USB-C cabl or adapt thi time around.Th one thing youcanbet on is that AAPL is watch the convers and evalu reaction - if not for the iPhon 8, then for a littl further down the line.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 20177 Stock to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buy RangeTh postAppl Inc.

Even if the compani manag to book half the retail price on each phone as revenue, it' go to take 120 million of them to add 10% to the top line.That' the real lesson of scale here. NOK never went away; it' still a big company, built on the chassi of the old Alcatel and Lucent network businesses. Now that it ha it phone back from MSFT, manag need to deploy them to embrac the futur and expand on the role the compani want to play in the Internet of Thing (IoT).To me, that mean develop phone that don't compet withAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) or Samsung for consum pocket space, but one that instead let smart devic commun with each other.

Is It Finally Time to Buy HP Inc. Stock?;3/2/2017;"Share ofHP(NYSE: HPQ) jump 9% on Feb. 23, after the PC and printer vendor post a solid first quarter report. Revenu rose 4% annual to $12.7 billion, beat expect by $850 million. Non-GAAP earn grew 6% to $0.38 per share, top estim by a penny.That mark HP' second straight quarter of year-over-year revenu growth, and repres it best top line growth sinc it split fromHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) in late 2015. Doe that rebound indic that it' final safe to buy HP again? Let' take a closer look at the bull and bear case to decide.HP' Envi curv all-in-on PC. Imag source: HP.makeArticleAd();Th bull case for HPWhen HP and HPE first split, it seem like the former would be burden by fade legaci busi as the latter expand into higher growth enterpris markets. PC shipment have declin for five straight years, accord toGartner, and printer sale growth remain anem due to the longev of exist hardwar and the grow use of digit documents.That' whi HP' growth in the first quarter wa so surprising. Person System (PC) revenu rose 10% annual to $8.2 billion, fuel by 7% growth from commerci custom and 15% growth from mainstream consumers. Desktop sale stay flat, but notebook sale surg 16%. In comparison, HP' rivalLenovo(NASDAQOTH: LNVGY) post just 2% sale growth in it PC and tablet divis last quarter. Gartner also note that HP' market share grew from 18.8% to 20.4% between the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016 -- and it remain the second biggest PC maker after Lenovo.Dur the confer call, CFO Catherin Lesjak attribut that growth to a better ""mix shift"" toward ""premium"" convertibles, detachables, and thinner devic with longer-last batteries. Thi wa an encourag revers from the earlier notion that PC had to becom dirt cheap to counter Chromebooks. Look further ahead, higher demand for ""VR ready"" PC could also get it desktop growth back on track.HP' high-end Spectr laptop. Imag source: HP.Last quarter, HP gener over $700 million in free cash flow and spent over $600 million on buyback and dividends. Those move keep HP' multipl low at 12 time earn with a forward yield of 3% -- which is support by a low payout ratio of 32%. Analyst expect for the current year (1% sale growth and flat earn growth) are also low that so upsid surpris are more like than downsid ones.Th bear case against HPHowever, HP' printer busi remain weak. Total print revenu drop 3% annual to $4.5 billion, as 2% growth in consum hardwar fail to offset an 8% declin in commerci hardwar and 3% drop in suppli sales. HP believ that scale up through it acquisit ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) print busi could boost the unit' sale and margin after the deal close in the second half of 2017. However, that move will also boost the weight of the sluggish print busi rel to Person System -- which could eventu hurt HP' overal top line growth.HP also believ that sale of larg format 3D printer for industri custom will offset softer sale of tradit printers, but that market remain a small one compar to it core inkjet and laser products. New subscript servic for suppli may boost it higher-margin revenues, but that strategi face ongo legal challeng from maker of gener cartridges.It' also tough for HP to sell commodit product like PC and printer oversea due to higher compon cost and currenc headwinds. Dure the confer call, Lesjak warn that HP had "" increas price global in respons to unfavor currenc movement and the increas cost of components, which could have a more signific impact on demand than we'v assumed."" Thi indic that the Person System unit' oper margin of 3.8% could drift lower thi year.Lastly, much of HP' earn growth come from layoff and buyback instead of gross margin expansion. Last October, HP announc that it slash up to 4,000 job (about 8% of it workforce) over the follow three year to gener up to $300 million in annual save by the begin of fiscal 2020. Streamlin the busi can be a wise move, but downsiz in the face of tough competit could also dull it competit edge.Th verdict: HP is a safe buySplit with HPE initi seem like a riski move, but HP ha done a solid job evolv it age PC busi while scale up and diversifi it print one. HP isn't a sexi high-growth stock, but it' fundament cheap, ha a respect dividend, and is a market leader in the recov PC market.

What Is Apple Inc.

The primari focu of the piec wa on the expect curv AOML display -similar to the oneSamsung Electron Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) offer with the Galaxi S7 Edge.But there wa also a more controversi claim. Cite sourc said to be familiar with AAPL' iPhon 8 releas plans, there wa this:""They said Appl would introduc other updat includ a USB-C port for the power cord and other peripher devic instead of the company' origin Lightn connector.""If true, the implic of such a move are considerable.Uh Oh: Will Appl Inc. (AAPL) Ditch Lightn Port on iPhon 8?Appl is look to it 10th anniversari iPhon to be a smash hit. The controversi surround the elimin of the port - which ha been use on all Appl iO devic sinc 2012 - could neg impact that launch.Last year' 's iPhon 7 launch wa cloud by complaint when the compani chose to elimin the standard 3.5mm headphon jack. In 2012, when AAPL ditch the 30-pin connector it had use for nearli a decade, the move meant buyer of the iPhon 5 couldn't use their new iPhon with exist speaker docks, cabl and other accessories.Mov from Lightn to USB-C wouldn't beasdisrupt sinc mani accessori now use wireless connectivity, but the move would still undoubtedli gener some bad PR.One Mobil Phone Charg for AllA I point out thi morning, one benefit for Appl would besynergi among it products. Currently, MacBook and the new MacBook Pro have onli USB-C ports, so iPhon 7 buyer can't physic connect to them without buy a cable. Switch to USB-C on the iPhon 8 would elimin that problem.However, Barclay manag director Blayn Curti ha a theori that AAPL may not actual ditch the Lightn port.H toldMacRumorsh believ the USB-C issu isti to a European campaign to elimin proprietari smartphon chargers.Th European Commission' ""One Mobil Phone Charg For All"" campaign ha a goal of have all manufactur adopt a singl charger standard. With more than 30 differ phone charger in use, it wa estim they gener over 51,000 ton of electron wast per year in the EU. Sinc USB-C is the new standard that mani smartphones, tablet and comput are move toward, it would make sens to adopt USB-C as the singl smartphon charger standard.Accord to Curtis, Appl is react to that EU goal, but to achiev the objective, it would offer a Lighting-to-USB-C adapt instead of elimin the Lightn port altogether.I Appl Inc. (AAPL) a Whale of a Trade? Go Long Buffett!Do so would mean one more dongl for European iPhon 8 owners, but wouldn't disrupt everyon else.Wil iPhon 8 Be USB-C or Not?TheWal Street Journalha an impress record of predict Apple' move with new iPhones. And USB-C would make Apple' life simpler when it come to connect with it latest laptops.But the Barclay theori make sense. A Lightning-to-USB-C adapt isn't the most eleg solution, but it would achiev the European Commission' goal, without caus unwant drama that could impact the critic 10th anniversari iPhon launch.Appl may yet ditch it proprietari Lightn port in favor of USB-C, but the iPhon 8 probabl isn't the right time to do so.Of course, we won't find out for certain until September, so stay tuned.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceMobil World Congress: Appl Inc.

The number tend to slow in the lead-up to the fall, when the new iPhon model is due to be released. However, thi year, a confluenc of factor could make that slowdown much more pronounced.Th biggest factor is the iPhon 8. With the current iPhon 7, AAPL is wind down it first three-year product develop cycle. That mean the iPhon it' tri to convinc peopl to buy for the next six month look virtual ident to the iPhon 6 and iPhon 6s.5 High-Tech Cash Cow Yield Up To 6%That can alreadi be a tough sell, but the iPhon 8 isn't onli the start of a new cycl - mean it will look differ and offer somecompel new features- it' the10th anniversari iPhone. Everyon is look to Appl to make a splash. Whi would you buy a plain Jane iPhon 7 now if the complet new (and possiblyradicallynew) iPhon 8 is just month away?Then there' the Galaxi S8. Samsung is Apple' tradit rival for sell premium, flagship smartphones.

Should I Buy Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsA few year ago,Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) seem like a sure bet. Hey, with it CDMA platform, the compani wa at the heart of the fast-grow mobil market. QCOM stock wa essenti a cash machine.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet late the compani ha been in a slump. Sinc the summer of 2014, QCOM stock ha lost about a third of it value. Of course, the tech industri is chock-ful of exampl of darl that fell on hard times.And yes, it can take time to get back into growth mode again. Although, when thi happens, the gain can certainli be standout. Just look at the comeback ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is up about 90% dure the past coupl years.So in the case of Qualcomm stock, is there much upsid or should investor remain wary? Let' take a look at three pro and three con and find out:QCOM Stock ProsMobil Powerhouse:Th root of QCOM go back to the mid-1980s, when seven engin team up to capit on the mobil industry. At first they focus on technolog to provid location-bas servic and messag for the truck industry. Then after a few years, QCOM would go big - that is, develop a standard, call CDMA, which would allow for better cellular communications.Th busi model wa to licens the technology, which would mean get aggress with patents. While success wa not immediate, QCOM wa determin to make CDMA a critic part of the mobil industry. And of course, thi wager ultim paid off handsomely. For example, just some of QCOM' marque custom includeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),XiaomiandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteMegatrends:Th mobil market is expect to grow at a nice pace, which should mean continu demand for Qualcomm offerings. There are current about 4 billion 3G/4G connect use CMDA system and thi is expect to increas to6.4 billion by 2020. But there should also be substanti benefit from the emerg of 5G technologies. These will allow for better perform for the Internet of Thing (IoT), wearables, autonom vehicles, virtual realiti and even remot medic procedures. While QCOM' R&D invest will be vital for capit on these trends, the compani ha also ramp up it deal-making. No doubt, the most notabl exampl of thi isth propos $38 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductor NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). Note that the compani is one of the top player in the fast-grow market for self-driv cars.Financials:Granted, QCOM' revenu are not grow at a fast clip. In the latest quarter, there wa a4% increase. But then again, the compani is fairli mature, so it can be tough to churn out strong growth. Yet QCOM remain a highli profit business, with fiscal 2016 net incom come to$6.7 billion. The compani ha also been sharehold friendly. Keep in mind that the current yield is at an attract 4%.QCOM Stock ConsLitigation:Becaus of the extens patent portfolio, QCOM collect a hefti royalti from most sale of smartphon across the globe - even for those devic that do not even includ ani of the technology! So as should be no surprise, there is much concern about this. The Chines governmentchalleng QCOM' practices, and the case wa eventu settled.But there are other major case that are in the earli stages, such as in South Korea, Europ and the U.S. Oh, and Appl ha also launchedsever major lawsuit against QCOM. The compani certainli ha tremend resourc to wage a brutal fight. Now as with ani legal dispute, it is tough to predict the outcome. But if QCOM ultim loses, then it core busi model will be in jeopardi and thi could certainli have horrend consequences. Keep in mind that the compani get about80% of it pretax profit from licensing.Trump Factor:A key part of the president' agenda is to get tough against China, which Trump consid a currenc manipulator. He ha also call for stiff tariff and sanctions. So if there is a trade war, the impact is like to be advers to U.S.-bas compani that deriv substanti revenu from China. Let' face it, the govern is crack down, favor domestic-bas oper over foreign ones. All in all, thi pose materi risk for QCOM. After all, about57% of revenuescom from China and Hong Kong.Competition:It is intense. Some of the tough rival includeBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) andTexa Instrument Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). There are also a varieti of startup that are gun for the mobil market. YetIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) may ultim be the biggest threat to Qualcomm. Last year, Intel enter an agreement with Appl to suppli chips. Befor this, QCOM wa thesol supplier.In other words, if the legal battl go against the company, Intel may be in a better posit to snag more and more business.Bottom Line on QCOM StockWith the recent slide in Qualcomm stock, the valuat is definit attractive. Consid that the forward price-to-earn multipl is onli about 11.5X.3 Reason Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Stock Is Head to ZeroBut thi may not matter much. For the most part, the impact of the litig is far from clear - and of course, legal disput often move at a glacial pace.

If not for it auto segment (it largest by revenue), which saw a 17% declin year over year to $656.0 million, 2016 ha been a winner.Ov at Fitbit, the top line ha been outstanding, with revenu grow 39.3% through the first nine month of the year to $1.6 billion. However, it' the bottom line that get a littl wonky.In the quarter end Oct. 1, 2016, Fitbit' oper profit declin 33.1% to $44.4 million; for the nine month end Octob 1, 2016, oper incom declin 69.3% to $72.9 million. R&D, sale and marketing, and G&A expens all have seen huge increas in 2016 as Fitbit struggl to remain on top of a wearabl market that' slow faster than anyon expected.InvestorPlacecontributor Aaron Levitt recent discuss Fitbit stock in relat to aslow wearabl market; he wa pretti blunt in hi assess of the job CEO Jame Park is do guid the compani through a rough patch that' seen FIT stock declin by 65% over the past year.""Both eMarket and IDC both cite smartwatch as the big reason for the declines,"" wrote Levitt. ""Consum just can't see the need for them as they overlap on featur alreadi found in smartphones. And when ad their heftier price tags, smartwatch are a fade fad.""So, what doe Fitbit do to counter the fact that wearables' 2016 growth will be less than half the 60% project at the start of the year? It buy not one, but two compani that make smartwatches.Bottom Line on Fitbit and GarminIf Fitbit continu to wast money on bad acquisit and wast overhead that doesn't move the needle, you can bet that Fitbit' comfi cash posit - $672 million in cash and market secur as of Q3 - will be gone faster than you can shake a stick at.So, should you go long on Garmin? Absolutely. With$1.1 billionin cash and market securities, no debt, and an oper margin of almost 21%, GRMN stock is a long-term hold.3 Stock to Buy for Better Deal Than the Great RecessionA for short FIT stock, I'm of two mind on this.Yes, theshort repres almost 36% of it floatand it margin are about one-third Garmin's, but with $3 in cash it' got to be attract to somebodi in the industri - mayb even Garmin. That should keep Fitbit stock from drop much farther.So, I wouldn't recommend investor buy or short Fitbit stock. Neither proposit look like it will be a winner ani time soon.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 5 Best Stock to Buy for Big Emerg Market ProfitsHere' How Appl Inc.

In one sense, a huge instal user base - which AAPL has, withmor than 1 billion iO devic in activ use- work against the company. When the iPhon first began to take off, AAPL wa sell to peopl who'd never own one before. Now, that pool of easi sale is dwindling. And Appl is left in the tougher posit of convinc it instal user base to upgrade.Thu the hand-wring about slow iPhon sales.Apple' Servic divis larg benefit from that huge instal user base, though. True, AAPL onli get one shot at sell these custom AppleCare. But onc they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Appl Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explor Apple' other services. They are increasingli adopt Appl Pay. They are in a prime posit to buy movi on their Appl TV. They are perfect candid to subscrib to Appl Music. There are plenti of hook for store data on iCloud. And of course, there is the App Store and the lure of it million of apps.Apple' Servic revenu doesn't come in big chunk like sell an iPhone.

But it add up, especi when over a billion custom are gener it.Mor importantly, that revenu doesn't drop off the same way hardwar revenu doe when peopl stop buy new iPhones.Som servic - like iCloud and Appl Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keep automat bill the customer' card everi month regardless of whether their iPhon is brand new or five year old. Appl Pay revenu are increas as more countri and busi accept it and iPhon owner grow more accustom to use it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeopl never stop buy apps. They may slow down after the initi rush of a new device, but develop keep bring entic new game and other app to the App Store. That mean the 1 billion user continu to download.Trad of the Day: Appl Inc.

Why Isn't Qualcomm's Pain Intel's Gain?;1/30/2017;"Share ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recent plung to a multi-month low after the chipmak wa hit by an FTCantitrust lawsuitin the U.S. andaddit lawsuitsfrom it longtim customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Apple, which exclus use Qualcomm' baseband modem in it iPhon between 2011 and 2016, claim that Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebat payment (compens for that deal) after it cooper with Korean FTC regulators, which were probe Qualcomm.Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Thi strain relationship between the two tech giant sound like great news forIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which start suppli Appl with modem for the iPhon 7 after it exclus deal with Qualcomm ended. The reason is simpl -- Appl could potenti buy all of it modem from Intel if it sever it relationship with Qualcomm.But Intel share bare budg after Appl su Qualcomm, and onli recent ralli follow it fourth quarter earn beat. Let' take a closer look at whi investor don't seem convinc that Qualcomm' pain can gener signific gain for Intel.Understand Intel' mobil strategyIntel doesn't report it modem sale separately. They'r includ in it massiv Client Comput Group, which includ PC and mobil chips. The group wa creat in 2015 to divert attent from the ongo loss at it mobil division, which previous report it result separately. Those loss were caus by it gener subsid of OEMs, with co-market agreements, steep discounts, and financi aid for use it mobil Atom chipsets.Bi the timeIntel kill offmost of it mobil Atom chip last year, the unit had spent billion of dollar to captur just 1% of the market. Intel' fatal mistak are easi to see in retrospect -- it sold off it ARM-bas Xscale unit in 2006 to focu on x86 chip in 2006, then reject Apple' offer to produc applic processor for the first iPhone.Sinc much of the Android market use Qualcomm SoCs, which bundl baseband modem togeth with ARM-bas processors, Intel realiz that the Atom couldn't gain much ground in the mobil market. Instead, it had to develop modem for OEM like Apple, which develop their own ARM-bas processor without integr modems.Imag source: Apple.Whi Intel investor aren't excitedTh problem with Intel is that it wa like negoti term with Appl from a posit of weakness, due to it need to stay relev in the mobil market. Sinc Intel ha a long record of take loss to gain market share in the mobil market, it' reason to assum that Intel sold it modem to Appl at veri favor price for the hardwar maker.Last year, Cowen & Co. analyst estim that the deal could gener $1.5 billion in revenu for Intel -- which would onli equal 2.5% of it project revenu thi year. Even if Appl drop Qualcomm and doubl it order from Intel, that growth wouldn't significantli offset Intel' sluggish growth in PC and data center chips. Moreover, those modem would like onli gener low-margin revenues, which wouldn't significantli boost it bottom line growth.To make matter worse, Appl throttl the speed of Qualcomm modem in the iPhon 7 to match the slower speed of the Intel modems. Thi indic that Appl didn't choos Intel chip becaus they could match Qualcomm' -- it like onli did so to reduc Qualcomm' negoti power. Thi mean that other OEM that use stand-alon Qualcomm modem won't like switch over to Intel modem anytim soon. Thi misstep mirror Intel' failur in mobil applic processor -- sever OEM initi gave the Atom a chance, but it wa doom by it inabl to match the power effici of ARM-bas designs.What Intel investor should expectIntel investor shouldn't assum that Apple' battl with Qualcomm indic that the two longtim partner will part way anytim soon. Appl andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been su each other for years, yet the Korean tech giant is still one of it top suppliers. Therefore, Appl is like tri to get Qualcomm to lower it chip price and licens fee instead of complet part way with the chipmaker.Even if Appl abandon Qualcomm, investor shouldn't assum that Intel will inherit the entir modem business. Appl often split compon order from multipl manufacturers, and it ha enough resourc to develop it own modem -- which would cut both Intel and Qualcomm out of the loop.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It wa also veri popular in Asian markets, where phablets, which can take the place of both smartphon and tablet, are often preferred. However, overal the bigger and more expens iPhon 6 Plu onli account foraround 20% of overal iPhon salesglobally.10 Stock to Buy That Alreadi Make America GreatIn 2015, AAPL ad a littl more appeal to the bigger iPhone, ad increas RAM to the optic imag stabil camera for the iPhon 6 Plus. However, that saw just a small uptick in sale of the bigger model.Last year, Appl roll the dice: It decid to releas a dual camera smartphone, a premium upgrad that it heavili promot as a must-hav feature. With thi advanc camera system, user could take DSLR-like portrait and optic zoom in on subjects. AAPL made thi key featur an iPhon 7 Plu exclusive, at the same time boost the price of it larger iPhone. Previously, it had charg $649 and $749 respect for the two sizes.

New iPad Might Be Late to the Parti (AAPL)It' like that the iPhon 7 Plu cost Appl more to manufactur than previou Plu version - it doe have more RAM, a larger batteri and that dual camera system - but at least some of the addit cost is offset by the boost from $749 to $769.The profit margin for Appl on the iPhon 7 and 7 Plu probabl remain roughli the same. However, with a base price that' $120 higher, have more Plu model in the mix mean that even if overal iPhon 7 sale are soft, the averag sell price of a new iPhon goe up. As a result, iPhon revenu could get a boost, despit sale that may not meet expectations.And, as theWSJarticl point out, there' anoth posit point for AAPL in the iPhon 7 Plu numbers. The fact that price the iPhon 7 Plu so high still result in big gain for the premium smartphon bode well for later thi year when the compani will releas the10th anniversari iPhon 8.

Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions Inc. vs. Infinera;1/28/2017;"Invest in the tech sector can be tricky. Competit tend to be fierce, which make it difficult to stay one step ahead. Two compani that have a strong histori of maintain their edg areSkywork Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andInfinera(NASDAQ: INFN) . Both of these busi have been take market share in their industri for years, which is impressive. But which of these two tech compani is the better invest today? Let' review the bull thesi for each compani so we can make an inform decision.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th case for Skywork SolutionsSkywork design and build chip that allow devic to connect to each other. The company' semiconductor are found in a wide rang of product such as routers, tablets, cars, and smartphones.Whil thi industri is quit competitive, Skyworks' uniqu abil to creat custom and complex solut for it custom ha given it a big edg over rivals. In fact, Skywork chip can current be found in nearli all of the top-sel smartphon in the world, includ those made bySamsung, Xiaomi, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .The massiv boom in smartphon sale over the last few year ha been a godsend for Skyworks. The company' revenue, margins, and profit have all soared, which ha taken long-term investor on a lucr ride.SWKSdata byYChartsWith the Internet of Thing ramp up and 5G technolog set to deploy, Skywork look well posit to continu deliv for investor from here. However, Skywork doe have an Achil heel that investor should be awar of. Appl is respons for more than 40% of Skyworks' total revenue, which is a bless and a curse. When iPhon sale are booming, Skyworks' result soar. However, when the Mac maker decid to reduc it channel inventory, Skywork reallyfeel the pain.Whil Skywork ha been sign deal in recent year to help reduc it custom concentration, Appl is such a huge compon of Skywork revenu that these two compani will remain attach at the hip -- for better or wors -- for the forese future.Th case for InfineraInfinera is a fast grow player in the optic network equip market. The company' product make internet provid live easier by allow them to easili (and cheaply) move vast quantiti of data around the globe.Lik Skyworks, Infinera ha also benefit from a number of tech trends. The rise of cloud comput and stream high-def video is make it difficult for provid to keep up with demand. That' forc them to invest huge sum of money to expand their networks, which ha been a boon to Infinera' business.Imag source: Getti Images.That' a wonder backdrop, but Infinera hasstruggledov the last few quarter to translat that bandwidth demand growth into financi success. While there are sever factor to blame, one of the biggest problem is competition.Ciena-- a much larger rival -- ha caught up to Infinera' technolog edg and ha been eat the company' lunch as of late. While Infinera' manag is awar of the problem and is invest heavili to recaptur it edge, it might be a long-haul until the compani return to top-lin growth.Of course, those worri have now beenpric into the company' stock, so investor could be in a posit to win big if the compani can grow faster than market watcher expect.Th better buyWhil I'm hope that Infinera can right it ship, there are never ani guarante of success. For that reason, I think that the better choic for investor today is Skyworks. Not onli doe Skywork promis high growth rate ahead, but it is alreadi so profit that it pay out a fast-grow dividend and still ha enough cash left over tobuy back boatload of stock. As long as the compani can continu to make progress at fix it custom concentr issues, then it futur is look quit bright.10 stock we like better than Skywork SolutionsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And thatbod wellfor MSFT stock.Th Nadella EffectNew CEO Satya Nadella deserv much of the credit for the turnaround in Microsoft and MSFT stock. Sinc Nadella wa wa appoint as CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, Microsoft share have skyrocket as much as 75%, when factor it 52-week high of $64.10 reach on Dec. 23.That come out to 25% annual returns.

Microsoft didn't reveal how much it paid for Simplygon, not that it price is important.

If I Could Buy Only 1 Stock, This Would Be It;1/25/2017;"Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();If I could onli buy one stock right now, then there are a few box that stock need to check. I'd like the hold to be rel safe in a tumultu time but still look like to gener modest short-term growth, while have the potenti for except long-term growth. I also want the stock to have a robust balanc sheet and be rel cheap in thi expens market -- and is a littl dividend too much to ask?For all of that, look no further thanApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Short-term growth prospect look goodApple' financ are massiv in almost everi way, with sale in the fiscal Q4 end Sept. 24 of $47 billion. Sale and earn actual slow dure the dure quarter, down 9% and 19%, respectively, but the compani ha guid for a return to sale growth in fiscal Q1.Some Appl bear have point to the company' relianc on it iPhon -- which made up about two-third of sale in the most recent quarter -- and that those sale are start to slow as the phone seem to be satur the address market. The averag sell price (ASP) of the iPhon segment ha fallen slightli year over year.However, the iPhon could have plenti of growth left. The new iPhon 7 launch in late 2016 seem to be perform veri well alreadi and should help to boost ASP onc again. Additionally, the issu with the explodingSamsungGalaxi Note 7, which ha even been ban on all U.S. aircraft, could help to make 2017 iPhon sale the highest yet.Imag source: Apple.Th bear also point to nascent growth in most of Apple' other products, such as it person computers, iPads, and the Appl Watch. One other area that' grow impress is the servic segment, which includ revenu from servic such as iTunes, iCloud, and Appl Pay. Thi segment' revenu grew 24% year over year to $6.3 billion in the fiscal year, make up 13% of total revenu as Apple' second largest segment by sale behind the iPhon segment. Servic are increasingli important, as the total number of Appl product in use continu to grow each quarter, mean more devic that are like link to an Appl account and could help servic revenu to continu grow nicely.Apple' robust financi positionWhil Apple' sale and earn have come under pressure, it cash growth ha not. Apple' oper cash flow in the most recent quarter surg to $16 billion, a new compani record for that time period. With so much excess cash flow, the compani ha grown it total cash and invest to $238 billion, more than a third of it market cap, and aboutdoubl the next wealthiest compani in the Unit States.Unfortun for Apple' capit expenditur advocates, about 90% of that money is store out of the U.S., as the compani ha resist pay heavi repatri tax to bring it back home. However, Presid Trump ha signal that he'd like to offer a much lower tax rate, mayb as low as 10%, for compani in Apple' posit that are seek to send huge chunk of money home. There are certainli other risk for Appl in some of Trump' propos tax ideas, such as potenti import tariff on good manufactur overseas, but thi one point is import for what it could mean for Apple' cash avail for immedi use.Long-term growth potentialApple' new wireless headphones, call ""air pods."" Imag source: Apple.Apple' modest short-term growth on continu increment innov and execut is encouraging, but it' much more fun to consid Apple' moonshot long-term growth possibilities. Appl increas it research and develop spend by about 25% to $10 billion in fiscal 2016.Speak of the company' huge cash position, there are a few fun reckless predict we can make about what the compani might spend that money on developing. Self-driv cars, virtual and augment reality, and more recent origin content for iTun are all area of growth that tech industri analyst are look for from Apple.Mi favorit reckless predict is that Appl will begin compet more heavili in artifici intelligence. Apple' Siri wa one of the first voice-bas search tool beforeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) enter the space with their smart home voice-activ devices.Amazon and Googl beat Appl to market with their home assist devices, but Appl isn't known for be an earli market mover -- rather, Appl ha a knack for swoop in with amaz product that in turn domin the market that' alreadi there. Let' not forget that Amazon and Googl have ventur into Apple' world with their consum electron much more than Appl would be ventur into their with it own artifici intellig assistant.WhyAppl stockstil look like a great buyFinally, in term of valuation, Appl still look cheap. Even though the stock is up 20% over the past six months, it' still trade at just 14 time earnings. Compar that with around 25 time earn on averag for the S&P 500, Googl at 30, and Amazon at 185. Also, Appl stock ha run up quickli lately, but it' still down from it high of around $135 in mid-2015, so it recent run doesn't look unreasonable.Add to that a rel cheap valuation, as well as all of the point cover here, that Appl stock also pay a 2% dividend yield, which could veri well rise as Appl deploy more of it huge cash load in 2017. The best invest strategi is one that' well diversified, but for all of those point -- if I could onli buy one stock, Appl continu to look like a great stock to buy and hold as a core long-term position.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Reviewing Samsung's Q4 2016 Figures And What Lies Ahead;1/24/2017;"Samsung Electron (SSNLF) publish it Q4 2016 result on Tuesday, post it highest oper profit in over three years, as a strong market for semiconductor product and the depreci of the Korean Won help the compani overcom some setback face by it smartphon division, follow the discontinu of it fire-pron Note 7 smartphon in Q3. While overal revenu remain almost flat at53.33 trillion won ($45.8 billion), oper profit expand by about 50% to 9.22 trillion won ($7.9 billion). Samsung expect earn to improv in 2017, as the compani take advantag of strong semiconductor price and stabl demand, although the smartphon unit could face some challenges, amid higher market costs, slow global smartphon shipment growth and mount competition. Below we take a look at some of the key factor that drove Samsung' perform over the last quarter and what to expect in 2017.We have a$1,340 price estim for Samsung Electronics, which is slightli ahead of the current market price.Se our complet analysi for SamsungmakeArticleAd();SemiconductorUnit Outperform On Tight Suppli And Samsung' High-End FocusSamsung' semiconductor busi had a solid quarter, with revenu rise by 12.5% to 14.86 trillion won ($12.74 billion), and oper profit grow by about 77% to a record 4.95 trillion won ($4.24 billion), driven larg by the memori business. Supply-demand condit in the memori market have been tight, with mobil OEM increas memori content on devices, effect bolster demand for NAND modules, while PC DRAM is see some under-supply, as major vendor have been reduc their product mix in favor of mobil DRAM, boost prices. While Samsung ha been benefit from the broader market tailwinds, the company' technolog edg and it focu on higher valu product also appear to be pay off.For instance, Samsung is focus on high density/perform DRAM over commod DRAM, while expand process migrat to the 48-layer 3D V-NAND. Samsung is look improv it process technolog further in 2017, migrat to to 1x-nm DRAM and 64-layer V-NAND, drive down costs. The company' system LSI business, which manufactur processors, also aid Q4 earnings, driven by strong demand for mid-to-low end app processors. 2017 is expect to be an import year for the LSI division, as Samsung look to ramp-up product of the next gener 10-nm product from it foundri operations. These chips, which could be a fixtur of high-end smartphon in 2017, are tout to be more batteri efficient, while offer better perform and a smaller form factor.Smartphon Busi Larg Shrug Off Note 7 ImpactSamsung' smartphon divis fare reason well, despit the Note 7 recal which occur in late Q3. Although segment revenu declin by about 5.5% year-over-year to 23.61 trillion won ($20.27 billion), oper profit rose by about 12% to 2.5 trillion won ($2.15 billion). Profit for the quarter wa aid by strong sale of the company' flagship Galaxi S7 and S7 Edge, which have higher margins, as well as sale of it mid-rang smartphon such as the A and J series. That said, thing are like to remain subdu over Q1 2017, as Samsung is increas it market spend in order to rebuild it brand follow the Note 7 crisis. Moreover, the company' upcom Galaxi S8 flagship is like to launch in Q2, move away from the March launch cycl that the compani adopt with the S7. The upcom devic will be crucial to Samsung, as the compani look to restor it imag as a vendor of cutting-edg smartphones, while contend with increas competit in the high-end of the smartphon market as Appl prep to launch a complet redesign iPhon later thi year, while Googl ramp up sale and distribut of it critic acclaim Pixel devices.

I think so. The asset-light strategi can allow for faster growth, nimbler action and much higher margins.BABA Stock and the Uber ApproachOK then, but what doe thi mean for investor in Alibaba stock? Is the Uber approach enough for there to be continu strong returns?Well, first of all, there is no doubt that BABA stock is highli profitable, which is in stark contrast to Amazon. In the latestquarter, Alibaba report a sizzl 55% jump in revenu to $5.14 billion and net incom spike by 66% to $1.14 billion.Th 7 Best High-Yield Invest for RetirementWhil the bulk of BABA stock' revenu came from ecommerce, the compani ha also been show strong gain in other categori like cloud comput (revenu more than doubl to $224 million) and entertain (the top line more than tripl to $541 million). Oh, and the compani ha continu to gain traction with mobile, which repres 79% of ecommerc revenues. In all, there are 450 million mobil monthli activ users.Granted, there are major risk to Alibaba stock. It can be tough to manag the complex of an ecosystem, such as by deal with issu like qualiti and custom service. Such thing have dog compani likeeBay Inc(NASDAQ:EBAY).At the same time, there are polit issues. And thi is not just about the uncertainti regard the potenti advers reaction from the Chines government. Of course, BABA stock is also vulner to Donald Trump - who ha certainli not been shi about hi anti-China policies. There could easili be higher tariff and other advers action that could make it tougher for compani to engag in trade.Kind of grim for Alibaba stock, huh? Perhap so. But the convent wisdom may actual turn out to be wrong. After all, Trump ha taken a tough approach on Europ too. In other words, there may be more temptat for these countri to focu on China - move away from the U.S. The same could happen in South America.If so, China may wind up becom an even more import econom power. And thi seem reason sinc the countri ha a rapidli grow middl class, whichiResearch Reportforecast will jump from 109 million in 2015 to a whop 830 million by 2030.What' more, the popul is rapidli go digital.

So wa Samsung' manufactur process. The compani built four test facil (one at each site where it assembl the doom smartphone) and put 700 engin to work test 200,000 Galaxi Note 7s plu 30,000 Galaxi Note 7 batteri pack on their own.

The batteri lack suffici space to expand and contract - as batteri do - when charg and discharging. As a result, the battery' electrod could touch, then short circuit. Thi issu wa not caught by the batteri manufacturer.Samsung point out that for it own qualiti assur team to have notic the problem, they would have had to X-Ray the batteries.Batteri from a second supplier (also un-named) use in some Galaxi Note 7s were fine. They becam the go-to replac batteri onc the first wave of troubl began. However, Samsung then push that second supplier to dramat increas it Galaxi Note 7 batteri product volume.Th demand to quickli churn out 10 million batteri overwhelm that company' product capabl and manufactur defect crept in.

Intel Corporation Executive Wants to Rename Its Next Big Manufacturing Jump;1/11/2017;"At the J.P. Morgan 15th Annual Tech Forum,Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) client comput group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy offer up some insight about hi busi unit, the company' largest by revenue.Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Near the end of hi presentation, Shenoy talk about Intel' chip manufactur strategy, exud confid that the company' manufactur technolog is the ""best in the world.""A part of thi discussion, he took the time to explain how the technolog that Intel call 14 nanomet is more like what it competitor --Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Co.(NYSE: TSM) -- call 10 nanomet (smaller is gener believ to be better).H then offer the follow commentari with respect to it upcom 10-nanomet technolog (emphasi mine): ""I'm confid that when 10 nanomet -- our 10 nanomet -- come out,and thi is someth that mayb we should renam it, I don't know, we'll think about that, but when our 10 nanomet come out, we will have a clear densiti advantage, and a clear perform and power advantag versu what other in the industri have.""I agree, and evensuggest that Intel do just that back in October.Sinc thi is someth that Intel seem to be consid now, it would be wise to just do it. Here' why.Lot of benefit, littl risk/effortIn the past, when Intel had a full-gener lead in manufactur technolog over it peers, it wa easi for the compani to stick to it own name schemes, even if it serv to undersel the characterist of the underli technology.For example, Intel' 14-nanomet technolog wa gener ahead of what it competitor were call 14/16-nanomet technologies. The chipmak may have been abl to score some addit market point by rebrand it technolog as 10-nanomet to make thi superior clear, but -- at the time -- that name methodolog didn't creat the percept that Intel is a gener behind.If Intel could get to market with futur technolog (10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, etc.) at the same time as it competitor got to their respect technolog go forward, then Intel could leav it name scheme unchang -- again, short-chang itself, but not give competitor opportun to say that they are ahead.But that' not go to be the case go forward. Intel' 14-nanomet technolog will be the company' onli production-worthi technolog over the next year. It competitors, on the other hand, will ramp up their respect 10-nanomet technolog in 2017, and Taiwan Semiconductor plan to ramp up it 7-nanomet technolog begin in earli 2018, right around when we will see Intel bring it 10-nanomet technolog to market.Intel will then go from squander a potenti market point, but at least appear competitive, to flat-out look as though it is a gener behind. Intel' competitor will sure use thi against the chipmak as they craft their own market messages, which are like to be carri far and wide by the tech press.Th easiest argument for renamingIntel' marketing/PR team will have two basic option for how to educ peopl about how the compani isn't actual a full gener behind what it chip manufactur peer (and their custom -- Intel' direct competitors) are fielding.Intel can renam it technolog to accur reflect their competitiveness.Intel can spend undu time and energi argu that it technolog are competit despit be brand in such a way as to suggest that they are behind the curve.On of these option is a veri easi solut to the problem that ha virtual no downside. The other is much more complicated, ha the potenti to come off as damag control, and might not even work (Intel' attempt to explain whi it 14-nanomet technolog is superior to compet 14/16-nanomet technolog have often fallen on deaf ear in the tech community).If Intel lose a singl chip sale becaus it refus to do someth as simpl as renam it manufactur technologies, then that would be a wholli unnecessari destruct of sharehold value.Do the right thing, Intel: Renam your futur manufactur technologies, begin with your next-gener 10-nanomet technology.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The acquisit wa made, in part, to boost TDK' Internet of Thing (IoT) opportunities, which is now look like an even smarter move than before, with InvenSense' recent releas of new IoT technolog last week.IoT is expect to be a $7.1 trillion market by 2020, and TDK is hope to use InvenSense' micro electro-mechan sensors, or MEMS, to help the compani transit from the mobil market to the IoT.makeArticleAd();So, here' all the new technolog InvenSens just releas that could help make that a realiti for TDK.The world' first seven-axi motion sensorInvenSens said last week that it ha start product of the world' first seven-axi motion sensor, call the ICM-20789. The compani said the product build on InvenSense' success 6-axi motion sensor by ad a new pressur sensor into the mix.Th ICM-20789 will be market primarili to the prosum and smart drone market (part of the broader IoT) to improv flight take-off and landings, as well as improv stabil when a drone is in hover mode by implement accur elev control. InvenSense' motion sensor are some of the best in the business, and thi new one with a pressur sensor could becom the standard for smart drones.Microphon for home IoT devicesTh compani debut a new signal-to-nois (SNR) 74-decibel analog microphon that InvenSens said can be use for in-hom and Internet of Thing devices. The new mic provid veri low nois audio captur and can be use with beamform and audio process algorithms.Voic command have becom the go-to way to commun with home IoT devic (think Amazon' Echo and Googl Home), so focus on high-end microphon for these type of devic could help InvenSens -- and eventu TDK -- make more inroad into the IoT compon segment.Th ICS-40730 is onli avail for sampl right now, but InvenSens said it'll enter mass product in the third quarter of thi year.6-axi motion sensor special tune for wrist-worn wearablesAn import part of the consum IoT market is wrist-worn wearables, primarili fit band and smartwatches.InvenSens isn't new to the wrist-worn space, but the newli tune ICM-20648 combin 3-axi gyroscop sensor and 3-axi acceleromet sensor with the company' updat softwar stack to improv step count and activ classif (walk, run, bike, sit still) in wrist-worn wearables.Th sensor also incorpor a ""Bring-to-See"" (B2S) capabl much like theAppleWatch's, where power is conserv in the devic by have the screen off until a wearer rais her arm to view the device.Th compani say ad all of these capabl into it wearabl tech sensor will speed up time-to-market timelin for origin equip manufactur and will be avail in the second quarter of thi year.Continu integr with more IoT platformsInvenSens announc that it SensorStudio graphic softwar develop tool can now connect toSamsung' Artik IoT platform to make it easier to program sensor and algorithm for IoT devices.Th compani said in a press releas that, ""The integr Samsung Artik Smart IoT platform provid the fastest path to secure, interoperable, and intellig IoT product and services.""InvenSens said that SensorStudio and it FireFli ICM-30670 Develop Kit are now compat with Artik, and that the integr ""help our custom transmit their sensor & algorithm output faster"" with end-to-end security.Partnership and compat are a big part of the IoT, as mani compani have gone in their own direct and set their own standards. With the InvenSense/Samung announcement, InvenSens is signal to the IoT market that it want it compon to be integr with platform design by other companies.What all of thi mean for TDKTDK alreadi sell some of it sensors, and it said when it made it acquisit bid for InvenSens that, ""Sensor are view as an import IoT-en technology, and TDK envis greatli expand thi portion of it busi and provid a broad rang of sensor solut to it customers.""Th compani is look to transit from a smartphon compon supplier to an IoT leader, and it call the Internet of Thing the ""next big technolog wave that we will be riding"". With the new InvenSens technolog list abov (which will soon becom TDK's) and the company' current sensor tech, it appear the compani is on the right path to see that plan play out.10 stock we like better than InvenSenseWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Chines electron maker releas an updat to it Mi Band thi year to includ a heart-rat sensor and a few other upgrades, and it' manag to keep the price point below $20 (in U.S. dollars) in it home country. For reference, Fitbit' averag sell price wa $93 last quarter.Xiaomi' domin is mostli confin to China, where it also hold a substanti share of the smartphon market. Xiaomi is work to extend it brand throughout Asia, particularli in larg emerg market like India.

It Gear S2 smartwatch differenti itself with built-in cellular connectivity, so it doesn't need to be connect to a smartphon to access internet-en apps.Samsung also benefit from bundl it newest Gear Fit model with it line of smartphones, includ the Galaxi Note 7. Despit the recal of the Note 7, custom were abl to keep their discount smartwatches, which inflat unit sale somewhat.Low-end devic like the Gear Fit, which compet with Fitbit devices, account for all of Samsung' unit growth in the third quarter.Earli daysSmartwatch have fallen out of favor recent as basic wearabl pick up the slack. IDC expect the market to more than doubl by 2020, and smartwatch could play a major role in that growth.Two main factor will impact the growth of smartwatch over lower-end fit bands. First, the introduct of cellular connect in more devic will make them more use as independ devices. Second, the growth of third-parti develop support will produc function that exce simpler fit bands.Al five compani list here are pois to take advantag of further growth in smartwatch if and when they take off, but Appl lack a low-end fit band to protect against a lack of consum interest in that market segment.10 stock we like better than FitbitWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It' also a huge chang in direct from the 1 cent per share loss it report in it fiscal fourth quarter of 2016.Revenu for the quarter clock in at $3.97 billion, a 19% improv on a year-over-year basi and a 23% improv sequentially. Thing becom more pretti for Micron stock, consid that analyst were expect earn exclud item of 28 cent a share on a revenu of $3.98 billion.Mor impressively, MU expect to earn between 58 cent and 68 cent on revenu rang between $4.35 billion and $4.7 billion in it second fiscal quarter of 2017. By comparison, Wall Street folk are expect 39 cent a share on a revenu of $3.91 billion for the second quarter. But is MU stock a buy in 2017? Here are the posit and the negatives.Th Good News for Micron StockTh impress first fiscal quarter of 2017 is mainli down to a favor demand and suppli dynamics. CEO Mark Durcan said suppli is declin while demand is rise in a number of it import segments. He said theaverag sell price for PC DRAM have gone up between 50% and 60%in comparison to trough pricing, follow about 18 month of price decline. Thi wa driven by oversuppli of DRAM chips, which saw consecut quarter of revenu declin dure it fiscal 2016.10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy for 2017Durcan also said that it NAND busi is see ""like-for-like"" price improvement. Micron stock is work on benefit more from the price improv here by shift it ""product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, which enabl higher densiti and lower cost product that also have lower [averag sell prices] ASPs""Apart from the fact that thi move would like improv segment profitability, it' also go to help MU stock deal with bigger competitors. Micron own onli the fourth largest share of the NAND market, behindSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),Toshiba(OTCMKTS:TOSBF)andWestern Digit Corp(NASDAQ:WDC). Samsung for instance, can afford to drive down cost and make up for the lower margin in it other busi if need be. So be abl to lower cost will help MU stock cope with competit pressures.Th Bad News for Micron StockWhil the company' expans move would help MU stock compete, I still believ that competit remain it biggest threat. The reason it' so much expos to competit is that it doesn't control the largest portion of ani of it key market - not even second largest. The leader can decid to flood the market to drive down price in the futur to win more busi and hurt smaller player like MU stock. Thi is similar to what happen recent when the compani wa report declin revenue.Micron stock is also expos to the unstabl PC market. In it first fiscal quarter, PC DRAM account for around $605.4 million of it revenue. That' about 15% of it revenue. As PC sale continu to declin - and they havedeclinedfor eight consecut quarter - it PC DRAM busi is go to suffer. Although, it should also be said that it mobil DRAM busi ha been contribut more to it revenue.Bottom line on MU StockWhil the demand and suppli outlook of the semiconductor market is favor for Micron stock in the near-term, concern remain as to whether it can deal with futur oversupply.Still, MU stock look better than some of it competitor with a forward price-to-earn ratio of about 11. Thi is cheaper compar toIntelCorporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) forward P/E of 13.Although that is quit attractive, it hing on assumpt that it will deliv impress earnings. If you'r confid in Micron' futur earnings, there could be a bargain here in 2017. Otherwise, I'd stay off MU stock.A of thi writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 10 Best S&P 500 Stock of 2016The 7 Best Monthli Dividend Stock for 2017The postI Micron Technology, Inc.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is In the “Dead Money” Zone;12/22/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBack in June 2015, one of the hottest IPO wasFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), which soared52% on it first day of trading.

Dure the past year, Fitbit stock ha lost a gruel 74% of it value.Source:Via FitbitNow, it' true that the IPO market can be extrem fickl - and there are mani exampl of turnarounds. However, with Fitbit stock, there are grave fundament issues. And yes, these could last for the long haul.makeArticleAd();Th ironi is that the company' manag ha made plenti of savvi moves, which is whi FIT stock had such a strong reception. The compani wa the earli mover in the wearabl market, have been found back in 2007. Fitbit wa extrem aggress with R&D, market and distribution, such as with the establish of a massiv retail footprint.Even though the compani would have period problems, such as with qualiti control, there wa littl doubt that it wa focus on creat standout products.Th Rise and Fall of Fitbit StockA is alway the case with the emerg of a high-growth market, it did not take long for rival to move in. Part of thi came from plenti of startups, which took advantag of the flush ventur capit funds.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017But there were also move from establish compani likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). These oper not onli leverag their tremend financi resources, but also their strong brand and massiv custom bases.Yet the compani that ha had the biggest impact ha been the mightyAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Even though the Watch is a broad-bas device, there are still import health and fit track capabilities. Besides, AAPL ha been abl to capit on it thrive ecosystem of developers, retail and distribut partner as well seamless connect with other AAPL devices.Unfortunately, FIT ha not done a great job in innov it product line late - or at least creat devic that gin up lot of excitement. The fact is that the demand for the Charg 2 and Flex 2 have been lackluster. And thi ha been evid in the latest earn report, in which FIT announc bleakguidance. Revenu are expect to inch up 2% to 5% on a year-over-year basi to $725 million to $750 million. The Street, on the other hand, wa peg $985 million.Of course, Fitbit stock took anoth dive on thi news.Th ironi is that the compani is no slouch when it come to plow money into R&D. The expenditur are at a hefti 15%.Although, even if FIT is abl to get back on track, it may not matter much anyway. Let' face it, Fitbit devic seem more of a niche. How mani peopl realli need - or want - to track their vitals? And for those that do, is there much need to upgrad on a regular basis?Ther are alreadi omin sign that the wearabl market is get to peak levels. Just take a look at an omin report from IDC, which show that the growth rate wa a mere3.1% in Q3. Keep in mind that it wa 67% in Q1!Then there wa a report from analyst at Deutsch Bank, whichstated: ""We continu to view Fitbit as a leader in the wearabl fit category, but given consum demand appear to be wane for wearabl devices, we are take a wait-and-se approach to the name."" In line with this, the invest bank drop the price target on Fitbit stock from $18 to $9.Oh, and there is also a studi fromGartner, which survey peopl in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. One of the conclus wa that 30% of those who had own a wearabl no longer do so. The report also show that 35% of the respond said that they believ that a smartphon is all that is needed.A InvestorPlace.com'sAaron Levitt recentlynoted: ""For the most part, those who want these devic alreadi have them.""Th Bottom Line On Fitbit StockNow, it' true that there may be an opportun in the healthcar space for FIT. For example, the compani hassigneda deal withMedtron PLC(NYSE:MDT) for the launch of an app that allow for monitor of diabet patients.Then again, FIT will need to fight tough competit forces. After all, in Septemb AAPL sign a deal withAetna Inc(NYSE:AET) to subsid the Watch for healthcar purposes.Whi Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock ISN'T Realli Stuck In A RutWhat' more, the healthcar industri ha long sale cycl and tough regulatori requirements. And again, there remain the issu of adoption. How mani peopl will wind up use devices?For the most part, Fitbit is in a realli tough spot. The company' product are not catch fire - and it also look like the overal market is satur and the competit forc are intense. It' an environ that make it incred challenging.

This Deal Is Another Reason to Take Lucid Motors Seriously;12/21/2016;"Silicon Valley electric-car start-up Lucid Motor said it ha enter a ""strateg suppli agreement"" with South Korean giantLG Chem(NASDAQOTH: LGCLF) for lithium-ion batteri cell for Lucid' upcom electr luxuri sedan, the Air.Th news wa someth of a surprise, as it follow an announc earlier thi month of a similar deal between Lucid and LG Chem' huge rival, the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). But if anything, it' one more reason investor interest in electr car should be watch Lucid' effort closely.makeArticleAd();Lucid Motor hope to begin product of it first car, the Air luxuri sedan, by the end of 2018. Imag source: Lucid Motors.What Lucid said about the LG Chem dealIn a statement, Lucid said the new agreement ""establish LG Chem ason ofth key supplier of cell for Lucid' products"" (emphasi added). The cylindr batteri cell LG Chem will produc for Lucid use a ""proprietari chemistry"" develop jointli by the two companies.Lucid' statement directli acknowledg the exist relationship with Samsung SDI:Lucid ha recent announc a separ batteri cell suppli agreement with Samsung SDI. Although both suppli agreement are intend for Lucid' first vehicle, there are other possibl applic for these cells. These could includ batteri develop for other compani as part of Lucid' powertrain suppli business, or variant of the sedan with specif perform requirements. The differ perform attribut avail from the two cell supplier provid Lucid with maximum flexibl to select the best cell for each application.Lucid ha veri high expect for the cell that are use in our batteries, and we are fortun to have two compani that are will and abl to work with us to meet our requirements.So, what' go on here?Two deal with two heavyweight rivalsIn one sense, it' not surpris that Lucid would seek a deal with LG Chem, which is alreadi an establish player in the still-new market for lithium-ion cell for automot applications. Most notably, it suppli the cell (and some other parts) forGener Motors'(NYSE: GM)Chevrolet Bolt EV, and it ha been aggress build product capac and seek other client around the world. (The Bolt' cell use a differ proprietari chemistri own by GM.)Of course, we could make a similar case for Samsung SDI. Samsung, which ha made lithium-ion cell for consum applic for years, ramp up it electric-car effort when it acquir an automot battery-pack busi fromMagna Internationalin 2015. That wa one of sever move it ha made over the last coupl of year in an effort to build a sizabl busi as atop-ti auto-industri supplier. Samsung SDI now suppli batteri forBMW's""i"" vehicl andFiat Chrysler Automobiles' electr Fiat 500e.Simpli put, both Korean compani are establish heavyweight jockey for posit as electr vehicl becom more commonplace. Meanwhile, asid from a few hand-built prototypes, Lucid ha yet to build a singl car -- but it ha manag to get deal with both to suppli batteri for it futur products.How did Lucid do that? And why?Th answer to the ""how"" may be found in Lucid' history. The compani now known as Lucid Motor wa origin call Atieva, and it wa origin found in 2007 to develop advanc batteri pack for electr vehicles. In it initi incarnation, Ateiva reportedli did electric-vehicl design and engin work for GM,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andAudi, and it also did some work on batteri pack for electr buse in China.Ateiva' direct chang in 2014 after a big fundrais round intend to jump-start it develop of a line of electr car (and it name chang in October). But the compani retain deep expertis in batteri and batteri pack for electr car -- and possibly, as it statement about the LG Chem deal hints, for other applic as well. That' probabl whi both Samsung SDI and LG Chem were will to make deals.A for why, Lucid hasn't quit spell it out. But there are mani Tesla veteran on Lucid' team (includ CTO Peter Rawlinson, who wa the chief engin on Tesla' groundbreak Model S). The compani often seem determin to out-do it larger electric-car rival -- or at least to make a point of show that it ha learn from Tesla' mistakes.In thi case, it' worth note that Tesla ha a deep relationship with one primari batteri supplier (Panasonic). Lucid may feel that Tesla' depend on a singl batteri supplier expos it to some risk that could be hedg by have strong relationship with two big suppliers.Mor evid that Lucid is for realTh deal with LG Chem is anoth sign that Lucid is a seriou effort worth watch closely. Lucid is plan to break ground on it new factori in Arizona sometim in the second quarter of 2017, and it' hope to begin ship it first model (the Air sedan) by the end of 2018.Those date may slip. However, my sens is that Lucid and it car are for real, and it look like a coupl of veri big supplier agree.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Risky Is Micron Technology, Inc.?;12/21/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.There' no such thing as a risk-fre investment. Sharehold alway need to keep an eye on the risk that come with own each of their stocks, in case those potenti demon turn up in the real market.makeArticleAd();A a longtim owner ofMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) shares, I'm about to take a fresh look at that stock' risk factors.You'r welcom to come along and look over my shoulder.Pric warsMicron' chosen specialti is in design and manufactur of comput memori chips, both of the DRAM temporary-storag varieti and the stabl NAND Flash memori type. It' simultan a veri matur commod market and a cutting-edg innov platform, and that mixtur lead to an extrem cyclic market.Th supply-and-demand equat for memori chip is prone to wild swings.Sometim the factori can bare keep up with global demand, and chip price hold steadi for a while. Ideally, tight suppli would result in higher street prices, but rise chip price are as rare as hen' teeth. So stabil is about the most favor price environ Micron and it rival can hope for.Then, two differ phenomena take turn to drive chip price lower.Manufactur method and the fundament chip technolog are alway drive down manufactur cost while boost product volumes. When these trend overshoot the end-market chip demand curve, price come crash down due to a product glut.Sometim market leaderSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) decid to push it memory-product pedal to the proverbi metal, caus a glut all by itself. Samsung can afford to do thi becaus it core busi is not in sell the actual memori chip -- it' more about build smartphones, home appliances, and consum electron gadget use those chips, and sell those finish product with a much higher profit margin.In either case, these price war send memori specialist like Micron scrambl for price controls. As the third-largest player in thi industry, Micron now ha a foot on the sectorwid acceler -- and on the brake pedal. So when the market is flood with cheap chips, Micron andSK Hynixcan pull back on their product schedul to restor some normalci a littl bit faster.Th reason I'm dive into Micron' price control power is simple. The presenc of that safeti net reduc the level of busi risk involv in own the stock. And of course, know more about how the market oper put you in a better posit to take action when someth unusu is go on.Imag source: Micron.Th current state of affairs2015 wa a terribl year for Micron, as Samsung put it back into memori product and chip price fell through the floor. Micron share plung 60% lower amid fall revenu and neg cash flows. Even now, Micron' trail free cash flow stand at a neg $2.7 billion.But thing chang dramat in 2016. Samsung ha reportedli shift it DRAM capit budget over to the newer 3D NAND market, leav room for one of those exceedingli rare chip-pric increas in the DRAM field.Meanwhile, the NAND market is see except growth on the demand side of things. Pick a technolog buzzword -- Internet of Things, automot computing, solid-st storage, and more -- and you'll find NAND memori play an import role in all of these macro trends. So demand growth is outstrip the suppli side' gain for once, and revenu are rise rapidli across the NAND market.Analyst expect both DRAM and NAND price to stay high over the next coupl of quarters. That' good news for Micron and it shareholders, and share price have bounc back to a market-b 46% gain year to date.What' next?Micron just close the$4 billion buyoutof DRAM technolog research Inotera. Thi deal should expand Micron' DRAM profit margin and add new revenu stream as sector rival pay good money to licens Inotera' groundbreak chip-design technologies.For a fresh updat on Inotera' busi impact, current price trends, and much more, tune in to Micron' earn report on Wednesday evening. Manag expect to deliv roughli $3.7 billion in top-lin revenu and about $0.17 per share in adjust earn per share. Analyst have set their target significantli higher on both counts, aim for earn of $0.28 per share on sale near $4 billion.Even at these elev earn expectations, Micron share are trade at just 9.9 time forward earn today. Both the compani and the stock have plenti of room for further growth. The downsid risk is also significant, but is limit by Micron' price power and solid balanc sheet.Long stori short, I'm perfectli comfort hold on to my Micron share in thi market environment. The like reward over the next coupl of year easili outweigh the risk of ownership here.10 stock we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Ignore Micron Technology, Inc.: Here Are 2 Better Stocks;12/17/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.Look atMicron Technology's(NASDAQ: MU) chart thi year, it' hard to imagin anyth could be wrong with the memory-chip specialist. Micron' stock ha risen more than 40% so far in 2016, easili outpac theNasdaq' 8% return. However, sinc the end of the dot-com bubbl sell-off around the start of 2003, a far more import long-term pattern ha emerg that anyon consid invest in Micron ought to consider:makeArticleAd();MUdata byYCharts.Whil more diversifi semiconductor produc likeIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) have also underperform the tech-heavi Nasdaq, Micron share have perform slightli wors than Intel while also prove far more volatil in the process. Thi boom-and-bust tendenc in Micron stock make it highli unapp from a long-term investor' perspective. So here are two other semiconductor name investor could do well to consid in lieu of Micron.1. IntelThough they share a common industry, Intel' and Micron' respect place within the semiconductor market give them littl els in common. Intel domin the market for PC and server microprocessors, the chip that serv as the ""brains"" for PC and servers. In these markets, speed matters, and Intel' abil to consist produc the fastest chip ha allow it to command premium price for it chips. Over time, Intel' cushi margin structur allow it to reinvest heavili in research-and-develop and manufactur innovations, thu extend it chips' competit position. Thi self-reinforc cycl ha lead Intel to enjoy what mani view as a moder competit advantag over rival likeAdvanc Micro Devices.Th differ in qualiti between Intel' and Micron' segment of the semiconductor market truli shine through when you compar their respect margin structures.For example, Intel' two core oper segment are each larger, more profitable, and more stabl than Micron'sentirerevenu base, which reli almost exclus on commodity-lik memori chips. Moreover, Micron, which recent releas it full-year fiscal 2016 earnings, gener $12.4 billion in sale thi fiscal year. And though Intel will not releas it FY 2016 report until earli next year, Intel' 2015 oper profit top $14 billion, more than Micron' entir sale thi fiscal year. For thi article' purposes, Intel' chief virtu is it lack of exposur to the low-margin memory-chip business.2. SamsungUnlik Intel, Korean conglomerateSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) compet head-to-head against Micron in the memory-chip market to a meaning degree. However, Samsung hold an advantag over Micron in that it memori busi serv as a singl piec of it mani busi segments, one that nice complement it consumer-electron businesses. Samsung' phones, tablets, wearables, and other devic requir memori chip in order to store the code on which their softwar runs. Manufactur it own memory, via it Samsung Foundri business, allow Samsung to reduc it relianc on third-parti memori supplier like Micron, while also lower it compon costs. Samsung' memori busi is not just a profit center for the company, but also serv it overal strategi by allow it to more effect produc it electronics.Equ important, Samsung like remain the market' largest memory-chip maker; Samsung not onli build it own chips, but also make chip for third-parti tech compani like. Especi in industri where the market set prices, be the largest provid can provid some benefit over the competition. In that vein, Samsung' $29 billion in memory-chip sale in fiscal year 2015 more than doubl Micron' total sale thi year. What' more, Samsung' massiv Foundri busi give it the abil to more effect compet for market share against stand-alon oper like Micron. However, I prefer Samsung (like Intel) over Micron for it diversif away from the memory-chip market, not it strong competit stanc within it.Foolish bottom lineEach of the compani present here wa select becaus it face less exposur to the memory-chip busi than Micron. As evidenc by Micron' perform thi year, investorscanprofit immens by invest in Micron under the right conditions. As in ani commodity-esqu business, though, time of weak price can caus wrench loss for compani like Micron, which reli on memory-chip sale as it sole sourc of revenue.To be sure, Micron ha done a nice job consolid market share, which could help give it the abil to compet throughout the memory-chip price cycle. However, for long-term investors, plenti of other stock in the semiconductor market offer less risk and more growth than Micron doe today.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Ifthatnam ring a bell, it should. Harman Kardon is a premium audio brand that' part ofHarman Intern Industries(NASDAQ:HAR). And that compani wa in the news last month becauseit' be purchas for $8 billionbySamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).Microsoft Cortana SpeakerTh Amazon Echo ha been success at establish a promin spot in the home for AMZN, and made it the hub of mani smart homes. Thi despit the fact that Amazon lack a smartphon and doesn't realli make ani smart devic (other than perhap the Fire TV). Seemingli out of nowhere, hundr of third-parti smart devic and servic now featur Alexa integr becaus of the Amazon Echo.Lik Amazon, Microsoft ha also larg been left behind on the smart home front. Connect devic tend to come with smartphon app that support Apple' iO or Google' Android. Some are begin to offer Siri integr and of cours a grow number support Alexa - via the Amazon Echo.Holiday Gift Guid 2016: Best High-Tech Gift Under $500Outsid of the Xbox, MSFT ha a minor footprint in the smart home. But a Microsoft Cortana speaker use the same approach Amazon took.It doesn't matter if no one' carri a Window smartphon if you can get them to buy a speaker that establish Cortana as their home' intellig assistant. Like the Echo, a Microsoft Cortana speaker is then in posit to becom the de facto smart home' hub. And it will drive more traffic to Bing - Microsoft' Googl search competitor.Partn with Harman Kardon is a smart move on Microsoft' part. Instead of shout ""me too"" along with the Echo and Googl Home, MSFT can posit it smart speaker as a premium audio solution. The Microsoft Cortana speaker wouldn't just be an altern - it would be anupgradefor Echo earli adopters.Onc Again, Appl Seem Caught Off GuardAppl ha spent much of 2016 look as though it' take a breather.New product releas like the iPhon 7 and Appl Watch Seri 2 have had the appear of be iter upgrad while the compani work on true next-gener devices. With the new MacBook Pro, there ha been a sens it larg ignor it core user base by introduc a flashi OLE Touch Bar and elimin legaci port in the name of get thinner.And with video stream becom a bigger and more competit business,Appl seem to have fumbled. It wa a pioneer in the live room with iTun stream and the Appl TV. But as compet hardwar get cheaper and gain 4K support, Appl still charg a signific premium for Appl TV streamer and neither it hardwar or iTun offer 4K support.With Amazon sell so mani Echo speaker and Alexa threaten to usurp iPhone-bas Siri in smart home integration, the expect ha been that Appl would releas it own smart speaker. The fact that the compani own a premium audio compani that manufactur best-sel Bluetooth speaker - Beat Electron - make the move even more of a no-brainer.Holiday Gift Guid 2016: High-Tech Gift Idea When the Sky' the LimitBut there' been silenc from Cupertino. It' almost like Appl never saw thi coming.With Samsung' peripher involv through it pend ownership of Harman Kardon, the Microsoft Cortana speaker mean that all the big consum technolog compani are now in the game. Except Apple.If Appl doesn't move soon, the competit is go to be firmli established. Eventu tri to muscl it way into the smart home - convinc peopl to ditch their Echo or Microsoft Cortana speaker for a Beats/Siri version - is go to be similar to Amazon tri to get peopl to dump their iPhon for aFir Phone.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceHoliday Gift Guid 2016: The Best Smartwatch and Fit TrackersHoliday Gift Guid 2016: The Best iPhon 7 CasesHoliday Gift Guid 2016: 5 Bluetooth Headphon for iPhon 7 OwnersTh postMicrosoft Corpor (MSFT) Take on Amazon With Cortana Speakerappear first onInvestorPlace."

But there are a few thing HP manag want investor to know that warrant a more bullish sentiment, particularli from folk in search of growth and income.makeArticleAd();Imag source: HP, Inc.Lead of the packNot surprisingly, global PC sale eas again in the third quarter, by 5.7%. The drop in PC sale mark the eighth straight quarter of neg results, an all-tim record for the market. That can't be good for HP, right? Turn out, the answer to that question is a resounding, ""Yes.""Despit signific declin by most global PC manufactur last quarter, HP wa one of the few that actual grew sale year over year, inch ever closer to China-basedLenovo(NASDAQOTH: LNVGY) in the race to becom the global leader. A year ago HP command 18.8% of worldwid PC sale compar to Lenovo' 20.2%.Thi year, HP ha up it PC game by target specific, nich market such as it virtual realiti (VR) ready, high resolut OMEN laptop for gamers. That strategi is a big part of the reason HP now ha a 20.4% market share, while Lenovo' piec of the global PC pie is just 20.9%. Don't be surpris if HP take over the top spot after thi year' holiday shop season come to an end.Th write on the wallAt least part of the aforement tepid expect from analyst is like due to HP' print unit results. But there are a coupl of thing HP manag want investor to know befor dismiss it print division.Last quarter HP report an 8% drop in total print revenu to $4.56 billion, led by a 12% declin in suppli sales. The thing is, in HP' fiscal 2016 third quarter, announc in August, print sale had slid a combin 14%, with suppli revenu sag 18% compar to a year ago. CEO Dion Weisler' PC strategi of target specif market segment is also work within it print division. A coupl pend opportun will help HP keep it posit print momentum going.Th pend $1.05 billion acquisit ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) print divis will give HP a boost in a number of ways. In addit to it multifunct copier technologies, the deal with Samsung also includ ""more than 6,500 print patents"" and over 1,200 engin and researchers.And Samsung' suppli busi should help HP' most struggl segment of it print division. Finally, there' the not-so-smal matter of the bud 3D print market, or as HP refer to it, the ""fourth industri revolution."" With two new-ish 3D printer now readi for the world' manufacturers, HP is expect to be one of the market leaders, if not the market leader. And with a price tag start at $130,000, it won't take too mani 3D printer sale to move the needle.On more thingIn addit to potenti growth well beyond the most analysts' expectations, HP offer sharehold one of the best dividend yield in tech. With a strong balanc sheet that includ $6.29 billion in cash and equivalents, HP' approxim 3.4% dividend yield isn't in jeopardi of be lower or discard anytim soon.In today' low interest rate environment, a dividend yield over 3% is outstanding.

2 Risks Qualcomm Will Face After Acquiring NXP Semiconductors;12/16/2016;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) seem to have open the door to automot rich with it pend acquisit ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . NXPcurrent holds14.5% share in the automot semiconductor market, which is expect to be worth $36 billion by 2019, and Qualcomm is buy the lead in thi fast-grow market with it pend $47 billion purchas of NXP.However, Qualcomm' NXP acquisit doe not ensur that the former will becom the domin player in the automot semiconductor business, as it will face a stiff challeng fromInfineon Technologies(NASDAQOTH: IFNNY) . Additionally, Qualcomm might face integr and margin challeng onc the merger is complete.makeArticleAd();Whi Infineon could pose a strong challengeInfineon Technolog is the second-largest supplier of chip to the automot industri with an estim market share of 10.4% to NXP' 14.5%. Thi mean that Infineon doe not lag NXP by a huge margin. What' more, in 2015, Infineon led NXP in two of the three subseg in the automot semiconductor market.Imag source: Infineon Technologies.Infineon led NXP in the market for power and sensor chip in the automot industri last year. These two market were worth $11.3 billion. In comparison, NXP led Infineon by a huge margin in the microcontrol segment, which wa alon worth $6.5 billion.In the long run, Infineon can close the gap on NXP as it is the lead supplier of drivetrain solut to electr vehicles. Infineon suppli it drivetrain solut to seven of the top 10 electr vehicl in term of sale last year. It count the like ofTesla Motors,BMW, Chevrolet,Volkswagen, and BYD Tang as it customers. Thi put Infineon in a strong posit in thi market as it project that sale of electr vehicl will grow from just 400,000 unit in 2015 to 10 million unit in 2025.Along with pend growth in the number of electr vehicl -- which account for less than 1% of market share in 2015 -- the amount of semiconductor content is also expect to grow. Infineon forecast that the semiconductor bill of materi in an EV will be as much as $705 per vehicl by 2025. In comparison, the chip content in each vehicl last year wa $332, accord to NXP.EV will carri higher chip content as compar to internal-combustion-engine-bas vehicl becauseth electr drivetrain use in EV contain a lot of electron for power switching. The electron system in a hybrid drivetrain rout power from the batteri to the motor through an inverter, while no such electron system are need in an internal-combust engine.Accord to McKinsey, the averag hybrid drivetrain contain 10 time the semiconductor content as compar to an internal-combust drivetrain. As a result, the demand for insulated-g bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, will continu increas as they play an import role in EV power systems.Infineon enjoy a strong posit in the IGBT market with a market share of 27.6%. In 2015, the IGBT market wa worth $3.94 billion, accord to Infineon, and some estim put it at $6 billion in revenu by 2018.So, Infineon could bridg the market share gap over NXP in the long run on the back of EV growth.Integr challengesQualcomm' acquisit of NXP will have a neg margin impact on the former. Thi is becaus Qualcomm' gross margin profil is higher than that of NXP. For example, in the recent report third quarter, NXP post a non-GAAP gross margin of 50.5%. In comparison, Qualcomm' gross profit margin in the third quarter stood at 58% .Thus, as Qualcomm begin to integr NXP after the merger is complet in 2017, the gross margin might start deteriorating. The higher gross margin profil of Qualcomm is a result of it fabless manufactur model as it outsourc it chip manufactur to foundri such asSamsung.On the other hand, NXP ha a foundry-bas busi model. It ha 14 chip manufactur facilities, along with seven packag and test facilities. However, these facil can't manufactur chip for Qualcomm as they are ""outdated,"" accord toMarket Realist. Thi reduc one potenti synergi from the acquisition.Despit thi hiccup, the NXP acquisit is expect to deliv $500 million in annual cost synergi for Qualcomm within two year after the closur of the transaction. However, 65% of the save will be on the oper expens side as Qualcomm will be abl to use NXP' exist relationship to sell it automot and Internet of Thing products.Qualcomm will also reduc it cost of good sold as the combin compani can negoti for lower raw materi price from suppliers. The reduct in the cost of good sold will account for 35% of the cost-sav synergi from the acquisition. The reason the cost of good sold synergi will be significantli lower than the oper expens reduct is becaus Qualcomm will not make much gain on the manufactur side of the busi due to the differ in the foundri business.Also, given the legaci natur of the foundries, it is like that NXP won't be get Qualcomm' money to upgrad them. Thi is becaus Qualcomm ha a differ busi model of outsourc it manufacturing, and invest in NXP' foundri would lead to an increas in costs.Although NXP will definit add anoth dimens to Qualcomm' business, we'v seen that it will also have a neg gross margin impact and pose integr issues. Additionally, the threat from Infineon cannot be ignored.So even though Qualcomm is make a smart move by acquir NXP Semiconductors, it is not guarante a smooth journey toward automot riches.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Electric-Car Fans Should Watch Lucid Motors Closely;12/15/2016;"Electric-car start-up Lucid Motor unveil it first product in a media event in California on Wednesday. Lucid' Air is a sleek high-perform sedan that will have specif and price calibr to compet directli withTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .Thi is significant, and investor interest in electr and self-driv car should sit up and take note. The Lucid Air is no flight of design fancy. It' a seriou product, and Lucid is a seriou compani that stand an excel chanc of succeeding. Read on.makeArticleAd();Th Lucid Air is an electr luxuri sport sedan that promis long range, thrill performance, and advanc self-driv capabilities. Imag source: Lucid Motors.About the carTh Lucid Air is a big luxuri sedan that promis to combin extrem high perform with a roomy, comfortable, and quiet interior equip with a lot of advanc technology.Lik the top Tesla models, the Lucid Air should be veri fast, at least in a straight line. It might be even faster: Lucid claim ""best-in-class energi density"" for the Air' 100 kilowatt-hour batteri pack, which it say will give the Air ""in excess"" of 300 mile of range.Onc the Air is in production, a 130 kWh batteri pack will be avail as an option upgrade. That will offer ""up to"" 400 mile of rang and ""up to"" 1,000 horsepower. Both figur are a step ahead of what Tesla' current top-perform model can deliv right now.Imag source: Lucid Motors.Lucid' batteri pack will use a new lithium-ion batteri cell develop by the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) that promis ""breakthrough batteri life,"" accord to Lucid' chief technolog officer, Peter Rawlinson.Th Air' motor and transmiss unit wa develop entir in-house, Lucid said. It claim that it' ""smaller, more effici and more power-dens than competitors, while potenti more reliable."" (The word ""potentially"" is do a lot of work in that sentence. But as we'll see, Lucid' engin are not new to the car business.)Inside, Lucid promis ""execut seating"" with cushy, reclin rear seat that offer comfort and legroom compar to first-class airlin seats. A 29-speaker audio system will provid activ nois cancel to ensur that it' a quiet space.A you'd expect from a Silicon Valley automaker, self-driv technolog will be built in. Lucid will aim to have the Air equip with ""Level 4"" self-driv capabl at launch, pend approv by U.S. regulators. ""Level 4"" system can take full control of the vehicl under most (but not all) conditions, with littl to no involv from the human driver.Th Lucid Air' back seat is scale for adult comfort. Imag source: Lucid Motors.Lucid hasn't final price for the Air. But it said that a fulli load ""launch edition"" will be price around $160,000, with standard version start around $85,000. Lucid hope to get the start price down to around $65,000 in time.If all goe accord to plan, product of the Air will begin in late 2018. But some big thing have to happen in order for that plan to pan out.I thi vaporware, or is it for real?It' for real. Thi is not vaporware. It could turn out to be a big deal. But there are some caveat that come with that statement.For starters, Lucid is a real company, found in 2007. It ha about 330 employees, mani with past experi at Tesla or at larg global automakers. It chief designer, Derek Jenkins, wa formerli the director of design atMazdaNorth America. And Peter Rawlinson, the chief technolog officer, came to Lucid with one of the greatest electric-car resum credenti possible: He wa chief engin on the Tesla Model S.In some ways, the Lucid Air can be thought of as the Model S 2.0. It' averyserious, advanc design that read in mani way as a redesign Model S inform by experience. And it' clearli veri close to production-ready. It' not a show car.Th shape of the Air' roof allow plenti of rear-seat headroom. Imag source: Lucid Motors.But that' where the caveat come in: Right now, Lucid doesn't have a factori in which to build the Air or anyth else.It ha a site for a factory, in Casa Grande, Arizona, select for it proxim to key auto-industri supplier in Mexico. It ha a packag of subsidi promis by the Arizona state government, and a detail plan to start construct the $700 million facil in the second quarter of 2017.But it will need to rais money to make the factori a fulli function operation. Lucid ha said that futur fundrais round are planned, but it hasn't yet given specifics.So should we take Lucid Motor seriously?I think we should. Lucid seem to be posit itself as a sober-mind (""lucid"") altern to Tesla, in part by make a point of be entir focus on electr automobiles. It doesn't have a whiz-bang CEO like Elon Musk -- but Lucid (which employ a lot of Tesla veterans, remember) might argu that Musk' outsiz public imag and futurist vision take attent away from Tesla' product in the here and now.If anything, Lucid seem quietli determin to learn from (and not repeat) Tesla' missteps. It won't rush the Air into product nor let itself get distract by far-futur visions. That ""lucid"" attitude, the car itself, and the seriou cash alreadi invest in the compani make it worth close attent as it plan unfolds.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Below we spell out some of the key factor that are like to drive the iPhon busi in 2017.We have a$125 price estim for Apple,which is about 10% ahead of the current market price.Se Our Complet Analysi For Appl StockmakeArticleAd();Weak at Samsung and Anniversari iPhon Should Help Bolster SalesW believ that the the iPhon 7 - which will remain Apple' flagship offer for at least eight month thi year - will see slightli better sale compar to the 6S over it life cycle. While thi will be partli due to better featur such as superior camera and water resistance, the devic could also win over custom from rival Samsung, which suffer a signific blow to it brand imag after a botch doubl recal and eventu discontinu it high-end Note 7 smartphone, follow a seri of fire and overh incidents. Thi is a boon for Apple, given that popular Samsung devic such as the S7 Edg were at least partli respons for the lacklust perform of the iPhon 6S. Moreover, Appl is expect to launch a complet redesign 10th anniversari iPhone, sport an edge-to-edg OLE display and other enhancements, in the fall of 2017. We believ that the devic should set off a super-upgrad cycl of sorts, sinc it would mark the first complet iPhon re-design sinc 2014.Chines Headwind Might ContinueMuch of the contract in iPhon sale dure 2016 came from China, and we believ that thing could remain challeng in 2017 as well. While thi is partli due to a depreci Yuan (The RMB is down by roughli 5% versu USD over the past year) and a weak macroeconom environ in China, Appl is also be hurt by competit from Chines rivals, who have significantli shorter product develop cycl and offer featur rich product at lower price points. Apple' share of the Chines smartphon market slip from 12.4% in Q3 2015 to about 8.4% in Q3 2016, per Counterpoint research. That said, we expect thing to pick up toward the end of the year, as Appl launch refresh version of the iPhone.iPhon Margin May Face Some PressureApple' iPhon margin could face some pressur in 2017. The iPhon 7 is report to be more expens to build compar to it predecessors, as it sport more advanc compon and higher storag capac (related:Apple' Flagship iPhon Keep Get More Expens To Build). Moreover, price power for the iPhon 7 could diminish as the cycl progresses, given it age design compar to Apple' rival who have been offer modular devices, bezel-fre design and curv displays. Moreover, the appreci U.S. dollar could also hurt Apple' margins, as over two-third of it revenu come from overseas. However, there could be two posit factor influenc iPhon margin in 2017. Firstly, the demand mix for the larger 7 Plu models, which command a $120 premium, appear to be stronger compar to previou iter of iPhone. Secondly, the 10th anniversari device, which should launch in the fall could be price at a premium, help overal margins.Th Pixel ThreatAlphabet' (GOOG) subsidiari Googl is now directli compet in the smartphon hardwar market with the launch of it high-end Pixel handset. The devic adopt the proven Appl model of offer well-design hardwar with tightli integr softwar and services. Review of the devic have been overwhelmingli positive, with critic prais it superior Android implementation, AI capabl and camera. Analyst at Morgan Stanley project that Googl could ship 5 to 6 million unit of the devic next year. While thi pale in comparison to the 200 million+ smartphon that Appl sell annually, the Pixel could pose a legitim threat to Appl over the long run for two reasons. Firstly, Googl still ha plenti of room to scale up it distribut footprint with wireless carriers, as Verizon is current it onli carrier partner in the U.S. Secondly, the switch cost around Apple' ecosystem are also come under threat, amid increas prolifer of third-parti cloud-bas servic which are larg platform-agnost and enjoy signific network effects.View Interact Institut Research (Power by Trefis):Glob Larg Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Larg & Mid CapMor Trefi Research"

The Appl Watch 2 start at $369 for the smaller-s ""sport"" version, however. While there certainli seem to be peopl will to pay thi hefti price for a fit device, the data show that the real market growth so far seem to be in the ""basic wearables"" segment, which includ those that don't offer third-parti apps, such asFitbit(NYSE: FIT) .The fitness-devic market in 2016 and beyondTh Appl Watch 1 is now avail for as low as $269. That' onli slightli higher than Fitbit' most premium model at $250, but it' substanti more than Fitbit' most popular tracker for around $100 to $200. The most recent number of how well each company' devic are sell continu to show that the growth is with the lower-cost basic fit devices, which control 85% of the market.Th Intern Data Corpor (IDC) report on fitness-devic sale worldwide. In the most recent data for the third quarter through September, Fitbit maintain it leadership posit and grew it market share (bi total unit shipped) from 21.5% in Q3 2015, to 23% in Q3 2016, thank to an 11% increas in unit sold.

Therefore, Apple' unit sold may grow more in Q4 when the new watch ha been out for a full quarter. The revers is true forSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , which releas two new smartwatch in Q3 and ship more unit by bundl them with Note 7 and other Samsung phones.Still, there' no get around the fact that it' clearli still a basic-fitness-devic market for the time being, and Fitbit seem to be grow it lead even in the face of cheaper option such as Xiaomi, with it $15 trackers. For 2017 and beyond, thi look like a grow opportun for the compani in the basic-wear space to take charg of thi grow market, which IDC expect to grow from about 101 million unit ship in 2016 to 213 million by 2020.

Major Apple Inc.

TSMC suffer a bit of a setback vis-a-vi Appl when it wound up split the A9 chip manufactur contract withSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , though the compani is believ to have secur all the order for the A10 chip that power thi year' iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plus.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Revenu from Appl repres a signific portion of TSMC' business, so the chipmak is like veri motiv to develop and releas compel new manufactur technolog at a rapid clip to keep Apple' business.Apple' upcom A11 is expect to be manufactur in TSMC' 10-nanomet chip manufactur technology, and the company' statementsstrongli suggestthat it will be use TSMC' follow-on 7-nanomet technolog to build the A12.TSMC recent detail that 7-nanomet tech. Let' take a closer look at it to understand what kind of perform and power enhanc Appl can potenti bring to the A12.Honey, I shrunk the chip!TSMC say that it 7-nanomet technolog can provid more than 3.3 time the rout gate densiti of it prior-gener 16-nanomet technolog (use to build Apple' A9, A9X, and A10 chips). Thi mean that function that requir a chip area of 100 squar millimet when manufactur in the 16-nanomet technolog could be done in just a hair over 30 squar millimet use thi new 7-nanomet technology.What Appl ha tend to do is keep it chip size roughli flat gener over generation, use the increas densiti to cram more function and featur into a given area.Data source: Wikipedia.Appl wa forc to use manufactur technolog that offer roughli the same densiti for three gener (TSMC' 16-nanomet technolog didn't offer a signific area reduct over it 20-nanomet technology; it wa primarili a perform improvement), which led to some die size growth over the last three years.Sinc the 7-nanomet technolog give a huge area reduct over the 16-nanomet technology, Appl can could conceiv pack in more than three time the ""stuff"" that the A9 chip had while still achiev a die size of approxim 100 squar millimeters.What ""stuff"" could Appl put in?With the A8 chip, Appl use a quad-cor graphic processor. The A9 and the A10 each use six core graphic processors. I suspect that the move to 10 nanomet for the A11 and then to 7 nanomet for the A12 will allow Appl to get much more aggress about increas the graphic core count (and thu graphic performance) of it next two iPhon models.Appl would also have more real estat to bulk up the size of the other key function block on the chip (i.e., imag signal processor, CPU, memori controller) to improv performance.Beyond the area shrinkTSMC say that it 7-nanomet process can deliv up to 40% better perform at the same power as it 16-nanomet technolog or up to 65% lower power at the same perform level.Imag source: TSMC paper.Apple' A10 ha two ""high-performance"" processor core and two ""high-efficiency"" core and the chip can switch between them base on the workload that the chip is requir to run.I suspect that Appl will take full advantag of the two ""extremes"" outlin here. The high-perform core could get a 40% boost in frequenc rel to what wa possibl on the A10, while the high-effici core could see a signific power reduct while keep perform flat to slightli up.Th futur look bright for Apple' A seriesAlthough Apple' A10 chip is blaze fast today, advanc in chip manufactur technolog coupl with architectur innov should allow Appl to make the A10 look ""slow"" within a coupl of years.Of course, app develop and Appl itself will have to find way to take full advantag of all that comput power (it' unlik that the A10 is be use to it full potenti in most app today), but at least the hardwar will be there.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

So it' no surpris that Appl isn't afraid to stand it ground (and even go on the offensive) against rival likeSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) orAlphabetInc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Apple' war with Samsung - the best-public of the lot - just turn in Samsung' favor. TheSuprem Court just hand down a major victoryto the Korean electron giant.But while Samsung might have won the latest battle, in the long run, it might not even matter to AAPL.Th Suprem Court Say ""No"" to AppleBack in 2012, when Samsung' Galaxi line of smartphon wa realli begin to challeng Appl for mobil supremacy, the whiz kid in Cupertino su the Korean tech giant. Appl alleg that Samsung stole or use variou patent and trademark in it products. Specifically, the patent design of the iPhone' rounded-corn front face, top ring/bezel and the now familiar and standard color grid of icon that repres variou app on almost all smartphones.Th 10 Best Under-the-Radar Stock to Buy for 2017The Galaxi line becam one of the most success seri of smartphon outsid of the iPhone. AAPL natur didn't like that.Appl initi won the day back in 2012, score amass $930 million settlementfrom Samsung that lower court later cut down to about $550 million. That' not exactli chump chang - especi one that had been stagnat befor it Galaxi hit. So Samsung did what ani firm would do. Itapp the rule onc again.Th case went all the way to the Suprem Court, which bring us to the present day.Th problem is the term ""articl of manufacture."" It center on the whether patent damag are calcul as a whole finish product (e.g., the entir phone), or just a compon in the product, such as the button or case.Th high court told Appl that it' just the compon in question, and sent the case back to the lower court for them to reconfigur the award. At stake is roughli $400 million in penalti that Samsung ha alreadi paid Apple.Big Issu at Play With AAPL StockTh money quot and bigger issu for Appl come down to the money quot from Justic Sotomayor: ""An award of a defendant' entir profit for design patent infring make no sens in the modern world."" Also, ""Those are polici argument that should be direct to Congress.""In short: If someon basic copi your design, onli those piec it copi will be subject to award unless Congress act to chang that ""articl of manufacture"" definit and the roughli 100-year-old law.For Apple, that' a problem. Technolog patent are basic what separ and differenti smartphon marker from each other. It keep the riffraff from steal AAPL' design and use them to sell their own products. Apple' product aren't the most high-tech or power (sorry, they'r not), but they are some of the best-design out there. That' whi Appl went to bat against Samsung in the first place.Clos watch the outcom of the legal battl between Appl and Samsung are tech giant such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet,Delland China'sLenovo. All have been target of Apple' recent legal and patent war. The outcom of thi case could (and like will) significantli alter the outcom of the other variou case on Apple' docket.It also could spur some lesser tech player to decid that it' worth the penalti to chase Apple' designs.Appl Inc. (AAPL): Is Appl Watch Circl the Smartwatch Drain?Firm such asNik Inc(NYSE:NKE) - who have partner with Appl and other tech firm on design project - are nervous wait to see the final outcome, too. It'll impact their abil to sue as well.For AAPL, The Award Isn't The IssueIf Appl ha to send some cash back to Samsung becaus of the lower courts, it won't be the biggest problem. Appl ha more than $230 billion in cash and investments.What' at issu is the patent and fierc protect of those design patents; what help build that cash hoard in the first place.It' too earli to tell what the overal effect will be.

Intel Corporation VP Talks Contract Chip Manufacturing Business;12/1/2016;"For sever years, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) ha made it clear that it aim to build a real busi out of play contract chip manufactur for chipmak that don't own chip manufactur plants, also known as fabless semiconductor companies.Intel engin insid of a develop factory. Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Intel' revenu from thi busi today is essenti zero, but the compani is put in signific effort to chang that situation. At a recent investor conference, Intel execut Staci Smith share some insight into it fledgl foundri business. Let' take a closer look.Address a tough questionAnalyst John Pitzer ask Smith the followingquestion: ""There [are] a lot of, I think, [views] out there in the invest commun that ... you [have] stringent design rules, your higher cost of manufactur just can't compet with the flexibl and lower cost you need for a boarder base foundry. How do you address this?""Smith began by admit that Intel' capabl in term of contract chip manufactur ""over the last three or four years"" weren't anywher near what more establish foundri such asTaiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been offering.""It' a stretch to call it [a] foundry. You call it semi-custom,"" Smith said.Smith point out that for a while, it lack a lot of the key tool and technolog requir to support smaller customers. That situation, the execut argued, ha changed. He said the compani ha built the capabl ""to be much more what the rest of the industri need to be abl to work with us as a foundri partner.""What about cost?In addit to address the challeng that Intel ha face in simpli build up the capabl to handl be a contract chip manufacturer, rememb that Pitzer' also rais a concern that Intel' chip manufactur technolog could be more expens than those of compet manufacturers.Smith argu that Intel can ""deliv a die cost that actual is better than the cost through the third parties,"" but he wa care to distinguish between per-chip cost (a.k.a. die cost) and silicon wafer cost.""It' not wafer cost; it' die cost. And that' becaus of the fact that we have higher density, we have better scaling, we have the abil to, frankly, have better yields,"" Smith explained.How can Smith' cost claim make sense?To understand what Smith is talk about, let' work through an example. Let' suppos it cost $10,000 to buy a silicon wafer from chip manufactur A, and just $8,000 to buy a silicon wafer from chip manufactur B. Additionally, suppos that a chip that measur in at 100 squar millimet in area on B' technolog can be implement in an area of just 70 squar millimet in A' technology.Und these assumptions, and under the addit assumpt of 100% manufactur yield for both -- unrealist in the real world, but use for thi discuss -- the raw die cost of a chip manufactur in B' technolog would be about $13.33. That same chip in A' technolog would be $11.57.In other words, assum constant yields, A' technolog would enabl a cheaper-to-build chip than B's, despit it higher wafer cost. If A' technolog also deliv superior manufactur yields, then that would further tilt the cost-per-chip advantag to A' favor.A big caveatTh major general-purpos contract chip manufacturers, such as TSMC, usual offer custom a wide varieti of chip manufactur technologies. These technolog rang from recent introduc process (i.e., 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer) to technolog that have been around for mani year (i.e., 55-nanometer, 40-nanometer).TSMC' revenu on those extrem matur technolog is significant. Last quarter, 45% of the company' sale came from technolog older than the 28-nanomet process that TSMC introduc in 2011, and 69% of sale came from the 28-nanomet and older technologies.Smith indic that Intel' advantag appli to ""leading-edge"" technologies, rather than to significantli older technologies.""So we can be veri competit on a cost basis, but it ha to be at the lead edge,"" Smith explained. ""When you'r talk about n-2 [gener manufactur technologies], and fulli depreci factori and thing like that, that realli isn't our busi model.""Investor takeawaySmith paint an optimist pictur for Intel' contract chip manufactur efforts, but investor need to wait and see if the compani is ultim abl to land signific contract chip manufactur deals. The one Intel ha announc to date are unlik to move the needl for the chipmaker, but perhap thi situat will chang in the future.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Pebbl is a smartwatch pioneer, but the privat held compani ha struggl sinc big consum technolog compani like Appl andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) decid to start sell smartwatches.Pebbl wa a success - on Kickstart - but it sale are a drop in the bucket compar to the number the big compani put out. Accord to IDC, in the third quarter,Pebbl account for just 3.2% of worldwid smartwatch sales- despit market leader Appl tank by drop over 71% year-over-year.Th 10 Best Under-the-Radar Stock to Buy for 2017A Pebbl acquisit would gain the fit wearabl compani a collect of new smartwatch (Pebbl ha recent begun roll out a new gener of devices) and the PebbleO oper system.Few peopl are buy the smartwatch - whose primari claim to fame are low cost and long batteri life due to use of an E Ink display - but PebbleO doe have develop support and a healthi collect of apps. It' also a smartwatch platform that work with both iO and Android.However, Fitbit devic also work with both Android and iOS, and Fitbit' ""smart fit watch,"" the Fitbit Blaze, cover much of the smartwatch need of most casual users, includ notifications. And Fitbit alreadi ha week-long or longer batteri life nail without have to resort to the dull, low resolut display use by Pebble.Pebbl wa tri to steer it smartwatch line-up into fit track territory, so thereport $40 million pricemay ultim boil down to cheapli elimin a potenti nuisanc rival, take on some of it key engin and gain ownership ofPebble' patents.Pebbl Ha Been Here Before…Th histori of Pebbl ha been one of struggl and rumor buy-outs. Past alleg suitor have includedApplein 2013, as that compani wa ramp up Appl Watch development.TechCrunchreport that last year,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) show interest andCitizen Watch(OTCMKTS:CHCLF) offer $740 million for the compani -but wa turn down.Th common denomin in each of these wa a compani look to fast-track smartwatch development. But now, most of the player who want to be in that market have their own platform, so Pebble' valu as an ""instant in"" ha tanked.A year after turn down the Citizen deal, Pebbl wa lay off staff, tri to rais more money on Kickstart and is now appar readi to sell for a small fraction of that price.Wil a Pebbl Deal Boost FIT Stock?Buy Pebbl is at least make a move in the smartwatch space and at $40 million, the price is almost trivial. It seem doubt that Fitbit will continu to manufactur Pebbl smartwatch for ani length of time -they aren't exactli popular.

Why Intel Corp.'s Big Spending Isn't Due to a Potential Apple Inc. Deal;12/1/2016;"Analyst Romit Shah with Instinet (bi way ofBarron's) recent offer up some commentari around microprocessor giantIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) plan higher-than-expect oper expens for next year.Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();On possibl that Shah point out is that Intel could be invest heavili in support of a potenti contract chip manufactur deal withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Intel current design and build the processor that power Apple' Mac computers, but the A-seri processor that power it iPhon and iPad product line are design by Appl and manufactur by other chipmakers, such asTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .""We have no insight into discuss between Intel and Apple, but within our mosaic, we believ an Appl foundri win would be highli sensitive, which might explain whi Intel is be uncharacterist vagu in it commun and wait until it analyst day in Februari to provid more detail on spending,"" Shah writes.Shah also say that ""a high-volum foundri win for Intel would materi increas oper expenses."" He goe on to add that ""part of Intel' value-add as a foundri is that the compani take on design work for the customer.""Here' whi I don't think thi explan hold water.Whi Intel is be so vagu about 2017 spendingIn the past, Intel would issu it full-year financi guidanc in Januari and then go into further detail on the key busi and financi detail dure an analyst day held in the spring. However, former Intel CEO Paul Otellini retir in May 2013, so the compani had to push out what would have been an analyst day in May to Novemb 2013. In 2014 and 2015, Intel host it analyst day in November. The compani would probabl have host it next analyst day thi month, had it not undergon a CFO transit in September.I suspect that the reason Intel is be so vagu at thi point is that it usual save these detail for either the end of a given fiscal year or it analyst day, whichev happen to come first.Would oper expens realli go up a bunch for Intel?Th next point that Shah make is that if Intel were to build Apple' chip for it, it would also have to take on a signific amount of the design work. To understand what Shah is talk about, it' import to step back and review the two basic develop model for fabless-semiconductor compani -- i.e., chip compani that outsourc the manufactur of their chip to third-parti manufacturers.There' what is known as the ""customer-own tooling,"" or COT model, and there' also the application-specif integr circuit, or ASIC, model. The follow passag fromEETimessuccinctli describ the differ between the two:""Traditionally, COT compani design integr circuit to the physic design level (GDSII) and sent those design directli to foundri to manufactur the wafers. COT compani then outsourc to assembly, package, and test vendors. An ASIC vendor, on the other hand, provid a turnkey service, manag physic design to deliveri of packag and test parts.""Intel offer servic analog to the ASIC model, but these day Appl is almost certainli oper under the COT model, mean that it doe the heavi lift on the chip implementation.So if Intel and Appl were to strike a chip-manufactur deal, I doubt that Intel would be implement Apple' chip design, though there is still an intens amount of collabor that must happen between chip manufactur and chip designer.For some financi perspective, TSMC, a compani that support hundr of fabless chipmakers, includ Apple, incur total oper expens -- R&D as well as SG&A -- of $2.79 billion in 2015.I find it hard to believ that Appl alon could move the oper expens needl for Intel at thi point.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders FEAR the iPhone 8?;11/30/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsSmartphon fan who have been eagerli wait for an earli glimps of the iPhon 8 fromAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) final got their wish. Some rumor spec were unveil thi week. And while not all of them (so far) were terribl surprising, AAPL stock holder were probabl encourag to know the devic is apt to be everyth it wa tout to be.Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashAnd yet, for owner ofAppl stock, the advent of the iPhon 8 isn't exactlyexciting.makeArticleAd();Whil the earli arms-length review of the smartphon have been mostli glow so far, AAPL stock holder know all too well that the compani is fight a headwind. At best, a success launch of the iPhon 8 buy time.At worst, a tepid launch of the iPhon 8 will prove iPhon mania ha run it course.An Earli Outlook for the iPhon 8Bear in mind that much can still chang between now and then. But as it stand right now,next year' iPhon 8 should consist of an OLE display, a complet curv glass form, wireless charg and no more home button. The camera should also be significantli upgraded,perhap even capabl of take 3D pictures. Moreover, the iPhon 8 is expect to be avail in three sizes, includ a 5.5-inch version.10 Loser That Will Be 2017' Best Stock to BuyTh usual suspect have alreadi gone ga-ga over the devic becaus … well, that' just what a good-siz sliver of the crowd doe whenev AAPL serv up a new product.KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is one of the phone' biggest fans,judg from hi sale expectations. Kuo believ sale of the iPhon 8 will be ""unprecedented,"" with the compani possibl ship between 90 million and 110 million unit dure the second half of the come year. That would be impressive, even if the next-gener iPhon is inde alower-margin device.But owner of AAPL stock may want to take such lofti project with a grain of salt, as no one ha answer the critic question.What the heck went wrong with the iPhon 7?Consum Don't Alway Do What They SayTo be clear, the critic sale figur for the iPhon 7 (and 7+) aren't out yet; the current quarter is the import one. But UB estim thatord for iPhon for Q4 2016 (allmodels) never quit match Q4 2015' peak. It also believ order for Q1 2017 are down overal on a year-over-year basis.That' a bit of a letdown to AAPL stock holders, consid how ballyhoo the iPhon 7 wa lead up to it launch.Th knee-jerk explan is that consum are simpli hold off on an upgrad iPhone, know the iPhon 8 is go to be a significantli more compel devic than the iPhon 7 wa rel to the 6 and the 6s. Problem is, we'v heard that before, and consum didn't alway come through when the time came.Cases(s) in point:Own of the 5s model were suppos to be wait for the iPhon 7. It doesn't appear they pull the trigger in a meaning way. The iPhon 6s wa deem by some to be the ""biggest increment upgrade"" ever for ani iPhon (from the 6), yetth 6s fail to even come close to meet expectations.Mayb those would-b buyer were hold off on the iPhon 7.Bi that same rationale, it stand to reason that anyon wait for the iPhon 8 may be will to wait anoth year for the iPhon 8s or iPhon 9. They'v held off before.And it' in that light where Apple' key sale messag may be come back to haunt it and, by extension, Appl stock. That is, AAPL ha gotten so good as say ""just wait until you see what we do with the next iPhone"" that consum are doingexactli that.Two Possibl Outcom for AAPL StockTo that end, there are two potenti outcom with the iPhon 8, neither of which is go to prove bullish (long-term) for Appl shares.On plausibl outcom is that the iPhon 8 end up be the smash success mani peopl seem to think it will be, with the compani sell 100 million unit in the back half of 2017. That' certainli possibl - if all those 5, 5s and even 4 and 4s usersfin make the upgrade.But if that ""powder keg"" should explode, a huge swath of iPhon fan will have no reason to upgrad for years. That' a problem, as Apple' best target market for new devic is owner of old devices.Thi could make 2017 a veri good year for Appl stock … but it could also leav no ga in the tank for 2018 and even 2019.Will Appl Inc. (AAPL) Beat Microsoft Corporation' (MSFT) HoloLens?Th second plausibl outcom is that the iPhon 8 doesn't draw the kind of crowd it' expect to in the first place, with would-b custom content with the post-buzz (and like cheaper) iPhon 7 at the time. Or worse, with those consumersopt for the veri impress altern phonefromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), or one ofSamsung Electronics'(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) mani options.Don't dismiss the idea that the iPhon can be push around now. Appl wa alreadi lose smartphon market share even befor the iPhon 8/iPhon 7 debat surfaced, and is expect to keep lose market share through 2020.

Apple Inc.

Sale are down, and margin are be pressured.Source: AppleHowever, now it' possibl that Appl may fight back against both of those problem next year by releas an iPhon Pro alongsid the iPhon 8.makeArticleAd();Th All-Glass iPhon 8We'v previous report that the case continu to mount for anall-glass iPhon 8. With 2017 be the 10th anniversari of the first iPhone' releaseandth first year in a three-year develop cycl AAPL ha adopt for it smartphones, it' time for a big change.Ad a glass back to the glass front will ensur that no one mistak the iPhon 8 for a previou model (one of the complaint about the iPhon 7). It would differenti AAPL' smartphon from the metal-back look it first made popular, but is now the norm among Android smartphones. A glass back also make wireless recharg more efficient, and Appl is known to be activ pursu that feature.What about earlier rumor of a curved-screen iPhon in 2017?Microsoft Corpor (MSFT) Surfac Phone Could Crush Apple, SamsungThat' where the case for an iPhon Pro start to becom more clear.A Curv OLE Display iPhon Pro?It ha been suspect for month that AAPL ha been pursu anew iPhon with a curved, OLE display- someth along the line of rivalSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxi S7 Edge.However, a report in theWal Street Journalsuggest two problem with that plan. First, ramp up OLE product on a scale to meet iPhon 8 demand may not be possible. Compani that make OLE panel - includ Samsung andLG- face multibillion-dollar expenditur to bring that level of capac on line, and time is short.Th second issu is cost. Accord to theWSJ, an OLE display could add $50 to the manufactur cost of the iPhon 8. Consid a$649 iPhon 7 is estim to cost AAPL $225 to manufacture, go to the OLE display would mean AAPL either hike price or take anoth hit to it alreadi squeez profit margins.Neith option is palatable. That' where the idea of an iPhon Pro come into play.iPhon Pro Could Solv Two AAPL ProblemsA suggest by9to5Mac, Appl could stick with it current LCD display for the iPhon 8 model next year, butadd a new higher-tier, premium iPhon Prothat incorpor the fanci curv OLE display.Thi strategi would give AAPL the curv screen look to splash across it market campaigns. The all-glass iPhon 8 still would look cool - and differ from the past three year - without the addit pressur on margin of incorpor an OLE display. Meanwhile, the compani could follow the model it ha adopt with the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro, charg a signific premium for an iPhon Pro.An iPhon Pro may not sell in the same quantiti as the iPhon 8, but by posit it as a new flagship devic with a key differenti feature, AAPL could charg a much higher premium for it.How Appl Inc.

Apple Inc. May Be First to Adopt This Tech;11/28/2016;"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) , or TSMC for short, is go to be bring it 10-nanomet chip manufactur technolog to market earli next year. Thi new technolog is expect to deliv better perform and significantli lower chip area than what it current 16-nanomet technolog is capabl of.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();TSMC ha made it veri clear that it expect to recogn revenu from 10-nanomet product in the first quarter of 2017. Accord to a new report from DigiTimes, it look as ifApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) may be the first custom to use thi technology.Next-gen iPad Pro reportedli to go into product in DecemberDigiTim say Apple' upcom iPad with a 10.5-inch display is expect to begin mass product in December, with shipment begin in the first quarter of 2016. That new iPad, DigiTim reports, will be power by Apple' next-gener A10X tablet-specif applic processor. The current-gener iPad Pro model use Apple' A9X chip.Ther is signific evid in the public domain to suggest that the A10X will be manufactur in TSMC' new 10-nanomet tech rather than it current 16-nanomet technology. Such evid includ theLinkedIn profilesof Appl chip engineers, as well as areportfrom well-connect Appl analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.If Appl is begin mass product of the next-gener iPad Pro model in December, that mean the compani will need production-qu A10X chip to go insid them. If we assum that it take about three month to build a chip from start to finish, then for A10X chip to be readi to support Decemb iPad production, that product need to have begun ahead of time.To that end, TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said on the company' third quarter earn call that the compani ha ""transfer 10-nanomet from [research and development] to product in the third quarter of thi year."" He also said the company' ""first 10-nanomet custom product ha been produc with reason yield.""It' certainli plausible, and inde veri likely, that the chip that TSMC wa talk about wa the A10X. Everyth seem to line up perfectly.A10X pave the way for A11TSMC' commentari in regard to the yield rate for it first 10-nanomet product doesn't suggest that said yield are by ani mean great. I suspect that both TSMC and rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , which recent began product ofQualcomm's(NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon 835 chip, rush to get their respect 10-nanomet technolog into product to meet their customers' strict product-releas schedules.Th Snapdragon 835 need to be avail to power flagship Android smartphon in the March-April time-frame, the A10X need to be readi for an earli 2017 iPad launch, and Qualcomm rival MediaTek ha said that it own 10-nanomet mobil applic processor, manufactur by TSMC and known as the Helio X30, will ship in the first half of 2017.The A10X and the Helio X30 are like to ship in low volumes, but they should be instrument in help TSMC to further boost it 10-nanomet manufactur yields. The technolog is go to need to be in top shape to support Apple' next-gener A11 chip that' set to power Apple' next-gener iPhones.Consid how big a deal Apple' next-gener iPhon are expect to be in term of unit shipments, Appl realli can't afford ani signific suppli bottlenecks.

How Samsung's Harman Acquisition Could Be Good News for Under Armour;11/25/2016;"Imag source: Harman.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)announcedon Nov. 14 that it ha agre to acquir the technolog companyHarman International(NYSE: HAR) in a $8 billion all-cash deal that look to be Samsung' overt push into the ""connect car"" market. Harman ha been increasingli gear toward car navig servic and other ""connect car"" car tech as part of it variou busi lines, so the move make sens as Samsung seek to gain stronger foot in thi market. However, there are a few way that thi deal could also be a major boost for the sport apparel and technolog companyUnd Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UA-C) .Under Armour' Harman JBL PartnershipOn of Harman' variou tech sub-brand is the audio and headphon compani JBL, which among other thing make sport headphones.Und Armour team up with Harman JBLearlier thi year when it releas it Healthbox tech bundl that -- along with a fit track wristband and connect scale -- includ wireless bluetooth headphones. Most recently, Under Armour and JBL releas an updat version of the sport wireless headphon that now includ a heart rate track feature. The headphon connect to the wristband or Under Armour' fit track mobil app (Record) to show user their heart rate.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Under Armour.Combin the two brand in a product like thi ha major benefit for both. For Under Armour, it' a chanc to further it goal of becom a tech-focus company, while also diversifi away from typic wearabl product that are made by so mani competitors. For Harman JBL, it' a chanc to get access to the more than 190 million user that Under Armour ha across it mobil fit app ecosystem, while also increas it brand name among fit enthusiasts.Imag source: Under Armour.Whi a partnership with Samsung could be big for Under ArmourPartn with Harman JBL wa a great way for Under Armour to break further into the tech world, but be partner now with Samsung could have far larger benefits.Similar toApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and it 2014 purchas of the audio and headphon compani Beats, Samsung could use it acquisit of the Harman JBL brand to help further it own audio segment with it mobil phones. We saw with the iPhon 7 that Appl ha put much more focu on elimin cord and cabl by forgo the headphon jack. When Samsung' next gener of Galaxi and Note mobil phone come out (assum they don't blow up) there is like to be a similar focu on use bluetooth capabl to elimin cords, possibl use JBL brand headphon as an option for wireless headphones.Anoth interest aspect of thi move for Under Armour is that it could help to bring it Record app further into the smartwatch industry. Similar to the way thatNikeha partner with Appl to make aNike+ brand Appl Watch 2with a focu on specif Nike featur like the pre-load Nike+ app, Under Armour could someday be the perfect counterpart for Samsung and it own smartwatches. An Under Armour-brand Samsung smartwatch with the Record app pre-load would help Under Armour' intern presenc and technolog focu immensely, while help Samsung to compet with Appl in the fitness-focus smartwatch market.Samsung' acquisit of Harman doe seem to be mostli a push into the car market that mani other tech companies, includ Apple, have also been vy for. Sinc the deal won't close until mid-2017, ani idea about other aspect of thi move are all speculation. Still, the idea that Under Armour is now partner with one of the largest tech and smartphon compani in the world is probabl veri good news for the sport compani and it long-term shareholders.10 stock we like better than SamsungWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Have We Really Reached Peak Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock?;11/23/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) cannot seem to catch a proper break nowadays.Appl stockha tumbl 5% two week after the compani releas fourth-quart earn that exceed Wall Street expectations, but fail to deliv the expect blowout quarter thank to shrink iPhon sales.Source:FlickrLong-suff investors, however, got a glimmer of hope when the compani issu somewhat upbeat Q1 2017 revenu guidanc of $76 billion-$78 billion and gross margin rang of 38%-38.5%.makeArticleAd();That revenu repres small, but significant, year-over-year growth, and will mark the first time Appl return to posit growth territori in four quarters. If thing actual pan out thi way, it would help to dispel fear that peak iPhon is now behind us and give a nice boost to Appl stock.Not So FastBut now a kill-joy analyst ha warn investor to quit do the victori dance. KGI' Ming-Chi Kuo ha warn that Appl mightfal short of it Q1 estimatesand could see weak in Q2 as well. Kuo ha model Q1 iPhon shipment of 40 million-50 million, which fall short of the 51.2 million unit ship dure last year' correspond quarter. Given that iPhon ASP ha fallen by more than 10% compar to a year ago, that would mean anoth dramat sale contraction.Kuo also warn that Q2 would face tough comp sinc it won't have the benefit of the iPhon SE thi time around. Appl is, understandably, not keen on an upgrad for the $399 model, which could cannib high-end model and dilut margins. Without the benefit of SE, Kuo expect Q2 iPhon shipment to clock in at just 35 million-40 million, compar to 40.4 million a year ago.10 Stock the Smart Money Like Right NowKuo, though, say the upshot to thi is that Appl will pressur it supplier to cut prices, which in turn will help preserv margins. Apart from a select few companies, such asSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), most AAPL supplier lack the bargain power to negoti better term when the go get tough.iPhon 8 Super-Cycle?Thi certainli doe not bode well for Appl stock. The iPhon 7 wa expect to stem the year-over-year revenu declin at the veri least, but thi might not happen. Ming-Chi Kuo ha been consist accur at make iPhon sale project in the past. In fact, he ha been regard ason of the best Appl analystsin some quarters.If the guy' estim are within the ballpark thi time around, it mean Appl will string togeth six quarter of revenu declines, someth that even perma-bul will have a hard time deal with. If thing play out thi way, it' go to becom incred hard to brush asid the bear with their ""peak-iPhone-is-history"" meme.Mayb we can chalk thi up to a satur problem, togeth with grow competition. After all, when growth in China, erstwhil Apple' fastest-grow and most promis market, is no longer forthcoming, there' reason to be worried.Th iPhon 7 ha not been veri well-receiv in China: onli 43% of consum have express interest in the smartphone, compar to 64% for the iPhon 6. Thi situat is perfectli understandable. After all, it probabl doe not make a lot of sens to buy an iPhon in China when you can get a devic that is roughli compar in look and perform at half the price fromXiaomiandHuawei. And, with ten of million of Chines now tote an iPhone, you can bet the devic is probabl no longer the statu symbol it use to be.Mani analyst remain optimist that the iPhon 8 will usher in a super-cycl that will encourag mass upgrades. The next iPhon iter is expect to sport excit featur such as wireless charging, an organic-light-emitting-diod (OLED) screen and a better camera. AAPL might even throw in a full-touch display without ani physic buttons, just for good measure. The new iPhon is expect to hit the market sometim around Septemb 2017. But, will power featur alon suffic to entic user to ditch their old devic and rush to their nearest Appl Store?Ch are that Apple' user-friendli Upgrad Program might be enough to do just that.

1 Way Qualcomm Inc. Is Leaving Intel Corporation in the Dust;11/23/2016;"Wireless-chip specialistQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recent announc it next-gener premium mobil processor, call the Snapdragon 835. The processor promis to provid more computing, graphics, and wireless perform than Qualcomm' prior-gener Snapdragon 820 and 821 chips. It is also, asMashablepoint out, ""the chip that will power everi premium Android phone in 2017.""Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Perhap most interestingly, it will be manufactur usingSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) 10-nanomet chip technology. This, Qualcomm appar boasted, mean that it mobil chip have now taken the lead in term of chip manufactur technolog away from processor target at person computers.Imag source:Fudzilla.What Qualcomm seem to be impli is that it' now beat microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which suppli most of the world' personal-comput processors, at it own game.Let' take a closer look at what' go on here.I Qualcomm a full gener ahead of Intel?To be clear, the contract chip manufactur have been play game with how they name their chip manufactur technologies. Intel' 14-nanomet technolog is wide believ to be significantli ahead of the 14/16-nanomet chip manufactur technolog field by Samsung andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) in term of chip area and potenti performance.In fact, Intel argu that the technolog that the contract chip manufactur call ""10-nanometer"" is veri similar, at least in term of chip area, to what Intel' 14-nanomet technolog can achiev -- though even Intel admit that those compet 10-nanomet technolog are denser than Intel' 14-nanomet technology.Imag source: Intel presentation.So for Qualcomm to impli that it' a full gener ahead of Intel is an exampl of market at work. Further, Intel is plan to introduc the first product built on it own 10-nanomet technolog in late 2017, which should allow it to pull decis ahead again -- at least for a littl while.That' not the point, though. The point is that, as Qualcomm point out in a presentation, mobil processor have gone from be manufacturing-technolog laggard rel to the personal-comput industri to be arguabl in a leadership posit in just five years.That reflect posit on Qualcomm and it manufactur partner and neg on Intel and it chip-manufactur division.Do Intel plan to fix this?Th major contract chip manufactur have made it clear that they plan to continu advanc chip-manufactur technolog at an unrel pace. TSMC, for example, is expect to start mass-produc chip on it 10-nanomet technolog thi year and intend to start build chip on a next-gener 7-nanomet technolog in earli 2018.TSMC' 7-nanomet technolog should be compar in term of chip area to Intel' 10-nanomet technology, though it' not clear whether one company' technolog will have an advantag in thi metric. Intel, on the other hand, ha told investor that it 10-nanomet technolog will go into product in the second half of 2017. Further, the compani say it plan to use deriv of that technology, perform enhanced, for three full product generations.Perform enhanc over time are certainli welcome, as they allow Intel to build better product with each generation. However, the fact that Intel ha back off on shrink chip area at a two-year cadenc while it competitor aim to stay on that pace is a red flag.I believ that Intel need to increas it invest in chip-manufactur technolog and work tirelessli to tri to regain an unequivoc and last technolog leadership position. Otherwis it risk eventu be left in the dust by the top mobile-chip seller and their contract chip manufacturers.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

""Nonetheless, for 'specif design purposes', the actual activ area may be around 5.1-5.2 [inches].""A larg (curved) display in a small footprint? Sound familiarIf the notion of a larg display in a rel small footprint sound familiar, it' becaus that wa one of the thing that wa quit nice aboutSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi S7 Edg releas earlier thi year. That phone pack a 5.5-inch curv OLE display, as measur along the diagonal. However, becaus the display curv into the sides, the phone' physic footprint isn't much larger than that of the Galaxi S7 with a 5.1-inch flat display.Apple' transit to a curv OLE display should allow it to achiev someth similar.Cal it now -- thi phone is go to sell like crazyAlthough the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu appear to be do well in the marketplace, I believ that next year' curv OLE model ha the potenti to sell like crazy.First, a signific chang in form factor and display technolog will probabl result in an incred impressive-look device.

Additionally, I suspect that there are some individu who prefer the Appl ecosystem and iO but ultim opt for phone such as the Galaxi S7 Edg becaus they like the curv display. Those custom could come back onc the OLE iPhon is avail to purchase.Indeed, it' hard not to see the parallel between what happen with the iPhon 6 and what could potenti happen with the OLE iPhone. Rememb that befor the iPhon 6 generation, Appl didn't offer custom iPhon model with larg screens. Thi decis probabl cost Appl some busi dure the iPhon 5s generation. However, onc the iPhon 6 and iPhon 6 Plu arrived, Appl saw signific market share gain and even pull-in of iPhon upgrades.Onc Appl begin field smartphon with curv OLE displays, even if they are rel pricey, I think the compani will be onc again pois to take share from high-end Android smartphon makers.

Apple Inc. Might Be Preparing for Blowout iPhone Sales in Fiscal 2018;11/21/2016;"Bloomberg recent publish an articlediscussingApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) desir to add organ light-emit diod (OLED) base display to next year' iPhon and the supply-chain challeng that Appl face in tri to do so.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();""Th suppli constraint may forc Appl to use OLE in just one version of the next gener iPhone, push back adopt of the technolog or other snags,"" the author write.Separately, gener reliabl KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a recentreportthat Appl is prepar three iPhon model -- 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch model with tradit liquid crystal displays, and a 5.1- to 5.2-inch version with a curv OLE display.Circl back to the report from Bloomberg, the author of that report say that ""Apple' initi OLE order fromSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is for 100 million unit over one year, accord to peopl familiar with the agreement.""If both report are true, then thi could suggest someth incred posit for Appl investors: Appl might be prepar for a surg in it iPhon busi dure it fiscal year 2018.Some perspectiveIn fiscal year 2016, Appl ship just shi of 212 million iPhon models. Thi includ iPhon 6, iPhon 6 Plus, iPhon 6s, iPhon 6s Plus, iPhon SE, and an initi batch of iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu sales.It' like that Appl will ship a similar number of iPhon model dure fiscal year 2017.With that context in mind, 100 million OLE display for a special, ultra-premium iPhon plan for sale throughout fiscal year 2018 seem quit significant.How mani curv OLE iPhon model is Appl plan to sell?Let' assum Bloomberg' sourc are good and Appl ha order 100 million curv OLE display in support of it iPhon build plan for fiscal year 2018.Next, let' assum that 75% of them ultim wind up on iPhon model that ship to customers. The reason that I don't say 100% is that even if that 100-million-unit order is for 100 million display that meet specification, they might ultim wind up on iPhon that don't quit pass muster.That' still 75 million iPhon models, or more than 35% of the total iPhon unit that Appl ship in fiscal year 2016.Thi suggest that Appl is expect a larg portion of iPhon buyer next year to opt for the curv OLE model. Although some sale of the curv OLE model are like to go to individu who would have otherwis purchas ""standard"" 4.7-inch or 5.5-inch LCD-equip models, I wouldn't be surpris if a good portion of those sale were increment to what Appl would have ship without the introduct of the OLE version.In that case, Appl would not onli enjoy signific year-over-year iPhon unit growth, but it could see substanti iPhon averag sell price growth as well sinc ani cannib of iPhon 8/iPhon 8 Plu by iPhon 8 OLE is like go to result in more revenu for Apple.Fisc year 2018 should be a good one for AppleBas on the analysi above, it' hard not to get excit for what could be in store for Appl dure it fiscal year 2018. The potenti for Appl to see signific growth in iPhon unit and averag sell price is hard to ignore.Should those factor begin to materi (investor should have a good idea if it will or not onc the compani issu financi guidanc for the first quarter of that year), the stock could be pois for signific earn multipl expans as investor gain confid thatApple' extrem import iPhon businesshasn't yet top out.An expans in Apple' earn multipl coupl with renew profit growth could mean thatAppl stockha a lot of room to run from current levels.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

NVIDIA Corporation's Biggest Business Surged 63% Last Quarter;11/20/2016;"Last quarter, graphic process unit (GPU) specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) deliv what could onli be describ as a ""blowout"" quarter. Overal revenu surg 54%, larg driven by eye-pop growth across three of it four major growth busi (gaming, automotive, and data centers).Imag source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Perhap the most impress thing about the report wa that NVIDIA' game busi -- the company' largest one by far -- grew from $761 million to $1.244 billion in the most recent quarter.Let' take a closer look at what NVIDIA manag had to say about thi perform on it most recent quarterli earn call.Lot of demandNVIDIA CFO Colett Kress said thi demand wa ""fuel by [NVIDIA's] Pascal-bas GPUs."" These GPU are sold either as part of add-in-board for desktop comput or integr into notebook comput design specif for game applications.NVIDIA first introduc Pascal-bas game graphic processor back in May, replac chip base on it prior-gener graphic architectur known as Maxwell.""Demand wa strong in everi geograph region across desktop and notebook [person computers], and across the full game audience, from GTX 1050 to Titan X,"" Kress continued.For reference, the GeForc GTX 1050 is NVIDIA' entry-level gaming-ori graphic processor that begin at $109, while the Titan X is NVIDIA' highest-end game product, price at $1,200.Kress also said sale of graphic processor aim at notebook comput ""record signific gains."" Thi wa like driven in no small part by the fact that NVIDIA' latest game notebook chip arenearli identicalto their desktop counterparts. In the past, NVIDIA' game notebook graphic processor offer notic less perform than the desktop versions.Stil ramp Pascal architectur productsOn the call, analyst Stephen Chin ask CEO Jen-Hsun Huang if he ""had ani thought on whether or not there' still a big gap between the ramp-up of Pascal suppli and the pent-up demand for those new products.""""In term of Pascal, we are still ramping,"" Huang began. ""Product is fulli ramp in the sens that all of our product are fulli qualified, they'r on the market, they have been certifi and qualifi with [origin equip manufacturers].""H went on to add that ""demand is fairli high"" and that NVIDIA will ""continu to work hard,"" presum to meet that demand.Additionally, Huang prais NVIDIA' main manufactur partner for the Pascal-bas game processors,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) , say that manufactur yield are ""fantastic"" and that the Taiwan-bas chip manufactur is ""do a fantast job support [NVIDIA].""It' worth note that although TSMC build most of NVIDIA' Pascal-bas product (GTX 1060, GTX 1070, GTX 1080, GTX Titan X, and Tegra),Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) wa confirm to be build the GP107 chip that power the entry-level GeForc GTX 1050 and GeForc GTX 1050 Ti products.On more thingAlthough the bulk of NVIDIA' game revenu come from sale of stand-alon graphic processor for gaming-ori person computers, NVIDIA is now back in the game consol chip busi with theNintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) Switch.Interestingly, Huang said ""Nintendo contribut a fair amount"" to the growth NVIDIA' game busi saw last quarter.That said, NVIDIA' overal Tegra processor busi brought in $241 million last quarter (and much of that is like from sale into automot applications, a segment that grew 61% for the graphic specialist last quarter). So, it' fair to say that most of the year-over-year game growth that NVIDIA enjoy last quarter wa due to gaming-ori graphic processors.Invest takeawayGiven the size and matur of NVIDIA' game business, see 60%-plu year-over-year growth rate is incred impressive. Per Huang, the revenu growth in thi segment ha been driven by both unit growth as well as averag sell price growth.I don't think NVIDIA will be abl to sustain such incred growth rate in thi busi go forward, but if thi busi can grow at a 15%-20% annual pace over the next sever years, that would not onli be impressive, but it could drive signific profit expans for the graphic specialist.Forget the 2016 elect and find out whi Nvidia is one of the 10 best stock to buy nowDonald Trump is the new president, and you'r natur wonder how best to protect your portfolio and profit in the process.

Did Samsung Buy Harman to Counter Apple and Google's IoT Ambitions?;11/17/2016;"Samsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recent agre to buyHarman Intern Industries(NYSE: HAR) for about $8 billion to expand it presenc in connect and automot electronics. Harman, a market leader in connect car solutions, suppli over 30 million vehicl with infotainment, telematics, safety, and secur solutions.Imag source: Harman.makeArticleAd();About 65% of Harman' $7 billion in revenu last year came from the automot market, and it backlog order hit $24 billion at the end of June. Samsung CEO Oh-Hyun Kwon claim that the acquisit ""perfectli complement Samsung in term of technologies, product and solutions, and join forc is a natur extens of the automot strategi we have been pursu for some time.""Merg Harman' automot busi with Samsung' mobil and smart applianc busi would make the tech giant a forc to be reckon with in the Internet of Thing (IoT) market -- and that could spell troubl for compani likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google.Whi Samsung need HarmanSamsung is the world' biggest manufactur of smartphon and consum electronics. The company' biggest weak is it depend on mobil devices, which account for 46% of it top line last quarter. That busi ha been shrink due to commodit and it costli Note 7 blunder.To diversifi away from that market, Samsung launch new wearabl devic and smart applianc to expand it softwar ecosystem, and acquir smart home compani SmartTh two year ago. To reduc it depend on Googl Android, Samsung launch it own OS, Tizen, for wearabl and select smartphones.Imag source: SmartThings.With those product in place, Samsung carv out a decent moat against rival ecosystem like Apple' HomeKit and Google' Home/Nest. But one area where it lag behind wa the auto market. Apple' CarPlay and Google' Android Auto took over dashboard with theirmirror features, but Samsung user were stuck with MirrorLink, a clumsier protocol which is also use bySonyandHTCdevices.But by acquir Harman, Samsung instantli becom a Tier 1 auto supplier, and it will gener cost-cut synergi by vertic integr it processor and display businesses. Furthermore, Harman' futur product will be built with Samsung' ecosystem integr in mind -- which should work more smoothli than product that are mere ""compatible"" with Appl and Google' mobil and IoT devices.How Samsung counter Appl and GoogleSimpli put, a person who own a Samsung phone, Samsung/SmartTh smart appliances, and a Harman-equip car could easili have their person data synchron across all three ""hubs."" Thi is the kind of ""ubiquit computing"" Googl ha talk about for years, and the kind of game-chang expans Appl need to diversifi away from it core hardwar devices.Neith Googl nor Appl can compet against Samsung' domin posit in first-parti consum electron like smart TVs, refrigerators, and wash machines. Both compani need third-parti applianc maker to make their devic compat with Home or HomeKit for them to sync to their mobil apps. That strategi is a fairli safe one, sinc Googl and Appl mere leverag their lead posit in mobil devic to expand their IoT ecosystem without shoulder the cost of manufactur new hardware.However, that strategi also reli on those partner make reliabl applianc which work correctli with their smart home ecosystems. The same issu could affect car which don't sync correctli with iO and Android devices.Whi Googl and Appl shouldn't worry... yetSamsung' game plan sound ambitious, but it could be bog down by technic issues. Samsung' SmartTh platform wa plagu with glitch earlier thi year, and research claim that the platform wa poorli protect from malici hacks. The recentMirai botnet attack, which use hijack IoT devic like router and IP camera to knock major websit offline, could also discourag consum to connect everyth to the internet.Samsung' previou attempt to carv out it own non-Googl ecosystem -- like Tizen, S Health, Milk Music, and the Galaxi App Store -- also haven't been veri effective. Instead, each attempt mere reveal that the major of Samsung owner prefer use Google' services.Samsung might now have the leverag in mobil hardware, consum electronics, and connect car to start build a cohes IoT ecosystem, but Googl and Apple' clout in mobil oper system will like counter that push by simpli convinc hardwar maker to tether their product to their Android and iOS-bas apps. Therefore, Samsung' purchas of Harman wa a smart move which will give it a grow automot part business, but it probabl won't enabl it to toppl Google, Apple, and other in the grow smart home/car market just yet.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stock we like better than SamsungDonald Trump wa just elect president, and volatil is up.

Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Samsung;11/17/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.Though they share the same market,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) andMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) have littl els in common.makeArticleAd();In addit to the memori chip market, in which they compet head-to-head, Korean electron powerhous Samsung also touch virtual everi corner of the consum electron market. At the other end of the spectrum, Micron Technolog manufactur and sell memori chip and noth else.Concentr ha made Micron a classic boom-and-bust stock, while Samsung' diversif and size provid investor shelter in time of fall chip prices. But Samsung lack Micron' upsid potenti when thing are flush. Given their apples-to-orang nature, let' compar Samsung and Micron across a few import invest criteria to see which repres the better buy today.Financi fortitudeA longtim follow of Micron will attest, the market for memori chips, particularli the commodit DRAM market, is fertil ground for boom-and-bust cycles. In thi area, have the financi flexibl to withstand an unexpect swing in memori chip price is critic important. Here' how Samsung and Micron compar in term of their liquid and leverag measures.CompanyCashDebtCash From OperationsCurr RatioSamsung$71.4 billion$11.1 billion$12.3 billion2.62Micron Technology$4.4 billion$9.1 billion$3.2 billion1.96Samsung data is in U.S. dollars. Data sources: Samsung, Micron Technologies, and Yahoo! Finance.Though Micron doesn't necessarili look to be in terribl near-term shape, Samsung stand head and shoulder abov it memori chip rival in term of it financi flexibility. To be fair, though, that shouldn't come as a surprise. Samsung manufactur and sell a dizzi array of products, rang from smartphon to oven rang hoods. Thi give Samsung tremend economi of scale versu the diminut Micron.At the same time, Micron' abil to financ it oper doesn't look especi precari as we see from it quick ratio of nearli 2. Micron' overal debt burden, though, doe appear alarmingli high. In fact, Micron flag that ""debt oblig could advers affect our financi condition"" as a risk factor in it SEC filings. Even if Micron appear to be use it leverag for product purposes, there' littl doubt that Samsung easili win the financi comparison between the two by a landslide.Winner: Samsung.Dur competit advantagesWith roughli 60% of it sale come from dynam random-access memori chips, or DRAM, Micron' financi perform tend to ebb and flow with the condit of the broader memori market. Especi given the products' commodit nature, it shouldn't come as an overwhelm surpris that Micron more or less lack a meaning econom moat. Micron' share-pric perform in 2016 speak to thi dynamic.MUdata byYCharts.You'l notic that the first half of 2016 look fairli bleak for Micron. It stock trade down sharpli as DRAM price softened, prompt media outlet to warn that matter will onli grow worse. However, owe to a number of factors, DRAM price didn't crater as mani expected, which help trigger Micron stock' impress ralli in the second half.Th point here, though, is that Micron larg succe or fail base on the whim of the market in which it operates. The same cannot be said for Samsung, whose product diversif ha a protect effect, as wa alreadi mention earlier in thi article. At the end of the day, there' simpli no comparison between the stay power of these two companies. If thi were a box match, Samsung take thi round in a first-round TKO.Winner: Samsung.ValuationAgain, the differ in qualiti manifest themselv when the companies' valuat are compared. Here' how Micron and Samsung stack up across sever of the most commonli use valuat metrics.Compani NameP/ RatioForward P/E ratioEV/EBITDASamsung11.313.42.9Micron Technology(66)11.17.4EV = Enterpris value. EBITDA = Earn befor interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Data source: Yahoo! Finance, except for forward P/E ratios, which are retriev from Morningstar.Aft lose money in 2015, Micron remain unprofit on a trailing-12-month basis, which explain it neg current P/E ratio. It' worth note that Samsung' bottom-barrel valuat like isn't the result of an oversight by Mr. Market. Though it often trade at someth of a discount to the broader market, Samsung' valuat like speak to the expect neg impact the Galaxi Note 7 recal will have on Samsung' bottom line. The compani recent revis down it guidanc and inform investor that the mass recal should cost it over $3 billion in the next two quarters.However, thi neg stori line will eventu fade into memory. When it does, thing will be back to busi as usual for Samsung, wherea it remain anyone' guess where Micron will end up in the come quarters. Look at each company' valuat through the context of it longer-term busi prospects, Samsung also enjoy the more compel valuat today.Winner: Samsung.And the winner is...Sweep all three categories, Samsung clearli stand as the more sustain stock pick for investor look to buy and hold for the long term. To be clear, thi doesn't mean that Micron cannot succeed. In fact, a sustain period of strong DRAM price could send Micron share to the Moon. However, it' anyone' guess whether that will happen. All thing considered, Samsung is the higher-qu compani and the better buy today between these two memori chip rivals.10 stock we like better than SamsungWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons HP Inc Stock Is Up 35% In 2016;11/16/2016;"Despit be in the ""wrong"" industry, and analyst rel blasé attitude,HP(NYSE: HPQ) stock ha quietli gone about deliv a 35% return in 2016. Combin with it stellar 3.3% dividend yield, HP ha been a growth and incom investor dream. So, whi aren't analyst in HP' corner?Th wane PC market and HP' poor print divis result are the reason for it consensu price target of a mere $16.27 a share. But there are actual sever good reason HP ha deliv so well in 2016, and is like to continu do so well into the future.makeArticleAd();Imag source:HP.Back to the basicsTh current HP could be the poster child for the old adage, ""There' more than one way to skin a cat."" Unlik mani compani in the tech sector, HP doesn't sacrific it bottom line to buy it way into quarterli revenu growth.HP deliv signific earnings-per-shar (EPS) growth compar to the year-ago third quarter despit a 4% drop in revenu to $11.9 billion. The compani accomplish that by shave nearli $600 million in expenses, and a whop $3.24 billion year to date. And with it workforc reduct under way, CEO Dion Weisler intend to make HP even leaner and more focus on it core competencies.Th benefit of HP' strict expens manag have improv margin -- a full two percentag point higher than 2015' 7.4% after remov one-tim item -- which in turn boost it oper earn 28% thi year to $800 million. The result wa a 37% year-over-year improv in EP to $0.48. Not bad consid it quarterli revenu decline.Turn lemon into lemonadeTh biggest piec of the HP revenu pie is it PC division, which is perform well abov expectations. However, HP' print unit is anoth matter, drop 14% year over year to $4.4 billion. Of HP' highest revenu divisions, suppli sale realli took a hit last quarter, drop 18% to $2.84 billion. But help is on the way.Weisl made it clear with the $1.05 billion deal forSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) print oper that HP wasn't go to sit idli by as print sale faltered. In addit to one of the industry' top line-up' of multifunct print (MFP) technolog and ""more than 6,500 print patent and a world-class workforce,"" the deal also includ Samsung' print suppli segment. Samsung doesn't break out print sales, but one pundit' estim suggest it gener about $1 billion to $1.6 billion last year.A note in a recentarticle, there' also the not-so-smal matter of HP' 3D print opportunity. There are billion of dollar at stake in 3D printing, primarili in the manufactur sector, which account for over $5 billion in sale a year ago. HP' new Fusion 3D printer are just hit the streets, and accord to one analyst some custom have been wait for the new altern befor invest in a competitor' device.How'd they do that?Contrari to the headlines, the PC market isn't quit dead: at least not for HP. Overall, global PC shipment drop 5.7% in the calendar third quarter. However, HP' strategi of target nich market such as it virtual realiti (VR) readi OMEN notebook help it drive a 2.3% increas year over year to 14 million unit and increas it market share to 20.4%. That' just a whisker behind industri leaderLenovo' 20.9% share.Mobil PC shipments, which includ HP' notebook line-up, actual increas worldwid last quarter in the ""low single-digit"" range. But HP' notebook sale climb 8% in the third quarter to $4.3 billion, make it HP' largest and fastest grow division. In other words, Weisler' effort to target nich opportun like game have help HP handili outpac the market, and mani investor' expectations.HP is lean and get leaner, the Samsung deal and 3D print should kick-start print sales, and PC are a surprisingli strong revenu driver. Add it all up and, if growth and incom are on your watch list, HP still warrant a good look -- even with it stellar perform in 2016.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stock we like better than HPDonald Trump wa just elect president, and volatil is up.

The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill;11/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTwo rumor about upcomingAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) product releas show the next target on AAPL' hit list: the display bezel. Analyst are call for an all-new 10.9-inch iPad in 2017, follow by super-s iPhon 8 models.Source: AppleAccord to a report from Barclays, all three new Appl devic will lose the display bezel, sport edge-to-edg displays.makeArticleAd();Th bezel is the frame that surround the display on a laptop or mobil device. No-on particularli like look at a bezel, but for year they have been a necessari design element. The bezel provid structur strength, and on smartphon and tablet it provid a place for manufactur to incorpor physic buttons.Whi the Bezel Get the AxSo whi would Appl want to get rid of the bezel on the iPhon 8 and the new iPad model it' expect to introduc next year?Visu appeal is high on the list, but there is a more practic purpos as well. Get rid of the bezel, and you can fit a larger display in the same size form factor.3 Reason Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great BuyIn the case of the new MacBook Pro, Appl chose to keep the same 15.4-inch and 13.3-inch Retina display as previou models. However, the smaller bezel mean the overal physic size of the notebook - their footprint - is smaller. Thi is a similar tactic to that use byDell.Th ""Infin Display"" in it XP 13 allow for a laptop that' close in size to an 11-inch notebook.What' Be Said About the iPhon 8 and New iPad ModelMacRumorspublish detail of a report releas by Barclay research analysts, who cite sourc within AAPL' Asian suppli chain as their sources.Accord to the analysts,two new iPhon model will featur bezel-fre displays. The iPhon 8 will have edge-to-edge, curv glass displays, free of bezels. The curv edg display is a featur pioneer by rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) in it Galaxi Edg phones. Get rid of bezel altogeth on the iPhon 8 will requir incorpor the Home button within the display.Appl took the first step toward thi with the iPhon 7, which featur a solid-st home button, replac the tradit physic button. So AAPL should have the technic know-how to manag this.We'v heard talk of curv display on the upcom iPhon before. What' new is the predict that the bezel-fre design will let Appl bump up the size of the new iPhon displays, while keep them the same physic size as the iPhon 7. The iPhon 8 would move from 4.7 inch to 5 inches, while the iPhon 8 Plu would go to 5.8 inch from 5.5 inches.Thi would be a big win. Consum like bigger display - they'r easier to read, while game and video look better. But there' a limit to how big a smartphon can be befor pocket- and usabl becom issues.Th predict that AAPL wouldreleas three new iPad model in 2017i also not new. However, the Barclay analyst have ad a wrinkl by claim the new 10.9-inch iPad Pro will featur a bezel-fre design with an edge-to-edg display. Do so will let Appl sell a mid-siz iPad that' the same physic size as the iPad Air 2 and 9.7-inch iPad Pro.Appl Rumors: iPad Changes, iBook App and an Appl Support AppA new iPad Pro with a larger display that' fashion bezel-fre would appeal to consum look for a fresh new design, while offer anoth option for Apple' increasingli import enterpris buyers.Bottom Line for AAPL2017 hasn't been the most stellar year for Appl product releases. Mani long-tim fan have complain about the company' choic to elimin ""outdated"" port across it model lines. Controversi over the lack of a headphon jack on the iPhon 7 and the move to all USB-C port on the new MacBook Pro in mani way overshadow their respect launches.However, if 2017 doe inde turn out to be the year Appl declar war on the bezel, expect to hear cheer instead of boos.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAmazon.com, Inc.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy;11/11/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is lag the market, and it ha been for a coupl of year now. That - and Apple' streak of revenu declin - make one wonder whether AAPL stock will ever realli be a growth issu again.Source:via AppleHere' where my mind wanders:makeArticleAd();Mi 21.5-inch iMac enter it sixth year of servic thi summer, and it' start to feel it age. Onc upon a time, when I got thi bad boy, I wa convinc that Appl could do no wrong. I love to flaunt that in the face of my brother, a staunch Window enthusiast.Fast forward to today, and like everi comput on thi planet that get old, it ha slow to a crawl. I'm now forc to watch that spin beachbal of death tell me my iMac is busi and might never get free.Yes, I realiz there are way of reduc that condition, but a tech nerd I am not. I'm all about busi models, sustain growth and bottom lines. I couldn't tell you the differ between my iMac and one sold in 2013. But what I can tell you is that Appl still ha a few trick up it sleev when it come to hang on to market share.Th wili old veteran of the tech biz still is a good play in my opinion. Here are three reason investor should own AAPL stock.MacBook ProI'v been itch to replac my iMac for a coupl of years, but everi time I think about spend Apple-typ money for a new machine, I fondli rememb all the good time I'v had with my exist desktop. Itch goe away.7 Buy for 7 Donald Trump Fear That Won't Come TrueI then think about how nice it would be to tap out a 600- to 700-word articl in my local coffe shop surround by people, not cats, where the energi in the room drive my creativ through the roof. The problem is I onli have an iPad Mini, and even with the accessori keyboard you can buy, it hardli seem like the tool use by a so-cal professional.However, I do believ a compromis ha recent arrived. Appl introduc it new MacBook Pro on Oct. 27.InvestorPlacecontributor Brad Moonhighlight all the detailsth veri same day. One particular sentenc caught my attention:""Th new MacBook Pro is significantli thinner, lighter and more power than the previou generation.""I'm almost sold.Forbescontributor Ewan Spenceha written a nice pieceabout Apple' latest product launch and it ultim success. He reason that MacBook Pro sale in the first two week have been signific due to ""pent-up demand"" (hi words, not mine) given there' been no real updat in the product over the past few years.And here' where Spenc make case for buy AAPL stock:""Th consum who want a solid, dependable, and fast machine… are happili buy the latest MacBook Pro. Whether Apple' sacrific of it core market [professionals] to reach the mass is worth it will becom clear over the next few years. Short- and medium-term prospect look rosy. Long-term will be a question for anoth day.""I'm one of the masses.AAPL didn't start to do realli well until it introduc product such as the iPod and iPhon that lean toward regular Joe and away from a nich audience. If thi is sell out, Appl ought to consid do it more often.Samsung Ha It Hand FullFirst,Samsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) phone start catch fire - so much so that the conglomer wa forc toperman discontinu it Note 7 phones, slice $18 billion off it market cap and like result in almost $3 billion in loss for the company. Then it top-load washer start exploding, and it wa forc to recall2.8 million wash machines.""Custom to Samsung: Get your shit together"" is an actual headlin CNET recent use for an articl summar the level of discont consum have for Samsung at the moment. It kind of paint a picture.Whi do I mention this?InvestorPlacefeatur writer Dan Burrowsdiscuss the ramif of a Trump presidencyth day after the fate result, recommend that investor not rush to ani conclus whether you own AAPL stock or are think of buying. Good advice. But what realli caught my eye wa a comment after hi articl by reader macnificentseven48. I'v cut it down to includ just the most relev parts:""Appl stocki a dog. Tim Cook is the onli major tech compani CEO who can't find some new side busi to boost revenue. He think sell more iPhon is alway the answer. There' simpli no good news for Appl on the horizon. I'm glad I'm get the dividend but the share price continu to stagnat while all the other tech companies' share price are soaring.""Really.Macnificentseven48, have you look at the share price of Samsung lately? Mayb you'd like to collect dividend from Samsung instead?Sinc Tim Cook becam CEO on Aug. 24, 2011, AAPL stock ha gener a cumul total return of 100.6%; theTechnolog SPDR(NYSEARCA:XLK) over the same period check in at 390 basi point less or 96.7%.Apple' do just fine.Apple' Oversea CashTrump' victori ha creat some renew buzz around hi one-time, 10% repatri tax that would allow Appl to bring home roughli $194 billion in oversea cash (after-tax) to use for dividends, share repurchases, etc.I'v never been a fan of compani pile on debt to repurchas stock becaus they can't (or more accurately, won't) repatri oversea cash given the 35% corpor tax rate they'd face as a result. To me, it'sun-American, and I said as much back in 2012.Appl Inc.' (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actual a Monster HitAAPL gener a ton of free cash, so even if it paid 35% on the $212 billion in oversea cash, it still would have $138 billion to alloc elsewhere, and the U.S. Treasuri would have $74 billion addit dollar to help all those poor disenfranchis Donald Trump voter in Ohio and elsewhere.So, whi do I view thi as a positive?Ultimately, whatev cash come back to the U.S. is better than none. Further, if it allow Appl to go back to be a debt-fre company, all the better for Appl stock holders, becaus eventu interest rate will go up.Bottom Line on AAPL StockApple' product might not be hit ani home run these days, but it' a heck of a lot better than have phone and wash machin that are blow up on customers.For thi reason, I believ AAPL stock is still a good play.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 10 Best Stock to Buy for the Rest of 2016The 10 Best ETF on the PlanetTh post3 Reason Appl Inc.

In it last quarter, the iPhon account for $28.16 billion in revenu and wa the biggest contributor to Appl profit.Thos number were down significantli compar to a year ago.

Some - like Samsung - will push back, but other will like cave in an attempt to retain Apple' business.If Appl achiev ani success in it effort to cut product costs, it not onli avoid the cost of releas a new iPhon SE, but it also make the exist model even more profitable.

Yet sinc the earn report,Appl stockha fallen into a steep dive. On Thursday, it tumbl below $110 for the first time sinc report of batteri problem with the Samsung Galaxi Note 7 began to circul in earli September.makeArticleAd();Appl Stock Performance, data byYCharts.With Appl now firmli on track to return to revenu and earn growth thi year, the recent plung in it stock price is somewhat baffling. Indeed, Appl stock onc again look veri cheap.Apple' growth is resumingFor the current quarter, Appl expect revenu to reach $76 billion to $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion a year earlier. Revenu growth should acceler after Q1, as year-over-year comparison will becom much easier.Moreover, Apple' Q1 guidanc could prove to be conservative. So far, demand for the iPhon 7 Plu is vastli exceed supply. Part of that probabl reflect peopl decid to buy Apple' ""phablet"" offer after Samsung' Galaxi Note 7 flame out (literally!). Yet Appl ha along track recordof boost suppli to meet strong demand dure the holiday season.It' still rel earli in the quarter, but iPhon 7 Plu suppli seem to be improv gradually. More Appl Store have at least some iPhon 7 Plu model in stock, iPhon 7 Plu usag is rise at a steadi clip, and the lead time for the popular jet-black version of the iPhon 7 Plu ha declin significantly. That bode well for Apple' revenu and earn in Q1.More opportun aheadTh stellar demand for the iPhon 7 Plu is a pleasant surprise, given that it ha a similar design to the iPhon 6 Plu and iPhon 6s Plus. Not too long ago, some pundit thought iPhon sale would declin again in fiscal 2017. (The Samsung Galaxi Note 7 wa initi expect to be a tough iPhon 7 Plu competitor.)Appl is see veri strong demand for the new iPhon 7 Plus. Imag source: Apple.Next year, Appl is expect to unveil arad redesignof the iPhon in honor of the iPhone' 10th anniversary. That could drive a big upgrad cycle, while bring in lot of new users, as wa the case when the iPhon 6 and iPhon 6 Plu launch two year ago. In that fiscal year, iPhon unit sale jump 37% year over year, caus Appl stock to surg higher.Apple' recent Mac lineup refresh could also contribut to revenu growth, especi sinc Appl dramat rais the price of sever models. Meanwhile, Apple' servic busi continu to deliv steadi growth, primarili driven by rise App Store sales, as well as growth in AppleCar subscriptions, possibl link to Apple' iPhon Upgrad Program.I Appl stock a bargain again?Aft fall below $110 on Thursday, Appl share trade for about 12 time the company' project fiscal 2017 earnings. That' a signific discount to the S&P 500 in and of itself.However, Appl also continu to have a huge amount of excess cash. Apple' $150 billion net cash posit account for a quarter of it market cap. If the U.S. govern ever manag to reform corpor taxes, Appl may have an opportun to repatri hundr of billion of dollar of oversea cash at a rel low tax rate. It could then use thi cash for share repurchas or a big special dividend.Aft adjust for the valu of thi excess cash, Appl stock' current valuat is closer to 10 time forward earnings.Furthermore, analyst may be underestim Apple' earn power thi year. If Appl can steal a meaning number of custom who would have purchas Samsung' Galaxi Note 7, it could blow past analysts' earn estimates, becaus the iPhon 7 Plu is such a profit product.It pay to buy the dipsAppl stock ha hit plenti of rut in the past five years. But each time the stock ha sold off, it ha bounc back in short order, reward investor who went against the herd and bought share of Appl when the stock wa struggling.Appl is pois to return to solid revenu and earn growth thi year, larg thank to better-than-expect demand for the iPhon 7 Plus. Next year' iPhon 8 product cycl will probabl drive even faster growth. With these (and other) opportun ahead, Appl stock shouldn't be trade at it current rock-bottom valuation.

One would be dedic to design and sell semiconductors, which is mainli a function of softwar and deal with custom who design products. The other would be dedic to make them, which is a function of capit and deal with custom that need chips.

Apple Inc.'s New iPhone 8 Strategy Sounds Brilliant;11/2/2016;"Thi year,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) releas two flagship smartphon -- the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu -- continu with the trend that it set when it launch the iPhon 6 and iPhon 6 Plu back in late 2014. Next year, however, the iDevic maker is expect to break with that not-so-long-stand tradit and launch not just two iPhones, but three.Imag source: Apple.makeArticleAd();P areportfrom gener reliabl Japanes publicationNikkei, next year' iPhon will come in three differ sizes. The smallest will be a 4.7-inch model, keep with the tradit set with the launch of the iPhon 6. The next step up will be a 5-inch model, with a supposedli ""premium"" model occupi a price tier abov the 5-inch mode.Even more interestingly, while the 4.7-inch and 5-inch model are expect to use flat liquid crystal displays, the 5.5-inch model is expect to employ a curv OLE display.Thi strategi is smart and could ultim lead to both unit share gain for Appl in the premium portion of the smartphon market and a boost in averag sell prices. Here' why.Of the three options, thi one is probabl bestThere' no deni that a certain segment of the smartphone-buy popul appreci the aesthet of a curv OLE display. Such display are certainli part of the reason theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi S7 Edg ha done as well as it ha in the marketplace, and whi the major China-bas smartphon manufacturers, such as Xiaomi, Huawei, and others, are roll out premium smartphon model incorpor curv OLE displays.Put curv OLE displays, especi high-qual one that meet Apple' demand display perform specifications, on a smartphon is unlik to be cheap. So with the iPhon 8 generation, Appl wa probabl face with the follow options:Absorb the increas cost structur associ with put curv OLE display on all of it iPhon models.Restrict the use of curv OLE display to a premium model, one that start at a price much greater than what current iPhon start at.Don't use curv OLE on ani iPhon dure the iPhon 8 generation.Opt 1 isn't desir becaus it'd almost certainli be gross profit margin-dilutive. Option 3 may be viable, but it could caus Appl to lose both unit share and, perhap equal importantly, mind share -- imagin hearing, for example, that ""Appl is no longer innovative.""Opt 2, at least to thi Fool, seem by far the best option. Custom who absolut want the most cutting-edg display technolog but prefer Appl and it softwar ecosystem will have the option of get that technolog from Appl -- for a higher price.That' prefer to not give custom who want those featur no choic but to buy devic from Apple' competitor -- henc the potenti for Appl to gain share in premium smartphones.Appl CEO Tim Cook admit on the company' Octob earn call that demand for the iPhon 7 Plu rel to the cheaper iPhon 7 is greater than the compani had origin plan for. So given the rel popular of the iPhon 7 Plus, it' reason to believ that iPhon custom are will to pay for innov new features.Shar gain and averag sell price increas both on the tableI believ that a decent portion of the Appl iPhon instal base would have gone with a non-premium iPhon as their next device. To the extent that those current custom do move up a tier -- and if the ""premium"" iPhon is attractive, thi may be a common occurr -- Appl should see a bump in the averag sell price.However, what' potenti more interest is that an iPhon that' a lights-out, technolog tour-de-forc could bring back into the Appl ecosystem custom who felt that Appl wasn't build product for them anymore. That could cover, for example, Galaxi S7 Edg and Galaxi Note7 buyers. Not onli would bring in a signific number of such custom help Appl drive unit-shar gains, sinc these custom wouldn't have purchas iPhon otherwise, but again, it would also help averag sell prices.Th prospect of see these dynam play out should be quit excit toAppl stockholders, particularli given how much of Apple' businessultim depend on iPhon sales.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

On the other hand, risk-avers valu hunter will reach exactli the opposit conclusion:MU Total Return Pricedata byYChartsAnd if that wasn't obviou enough, these fundament financi differ between Micron and Intel just might tip your scales:Financi MetricIntelMicronRevenu (TTM)$57.9 billion$12.4 billionNet Incom (TTM)$10.4 billion$(276) millionEBITDA Profit (TTM)$22.3 billion$3.3 billionTot Cash$17.8 billion$4.4 billionTot Debt$27.6 billion$9.9 billionCredit RatingA1 (medium investment-grade)Ba3 (non-invest grade, speculative)Data from Yahoo! Finance. TTM = trail twelv months.It realli doesn't matter how you slice it. Intel alway come out as the more stabl and reliabl choic in thi contest. The company' credit rate is compar to that of major banks, and better than those of some European countries. But a bank or a countri with Micron' riski credit rate is stand with one leg in all-out bankruptci already.Micron is neither a bank nor a country, though -- plenti of respect busi get by just fine with speculative-grad credit ratings. But interest rate will be higher when they take out loans, and these rate are a good indic of busi risk. In a nutshell, Intel is a low-risk investment, while Micron investor must accept a higher level of financi risk.Th case for MicronIf all sign point in favor of Intel, whi would anybodi want to own Micron instead?Micron' chosen trade is extrem cyclical. Sure, Intel' order volum move up and down with the economy, with the short-term popular of PC systems, with the global need for big-iron enterpris servers, and mani other factors. But none of these market-mov factor can hold a candl to the drastic up and down of the comput memori market.In short, Micron is subject to all of the same product demand driver that affect Intel --plusregularli occur price war that have noth to do with end-us demand.When memori market leadersSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , Hynix, and Micron get along, street price for memori chip can hold steadi for year at a time. In these time of prosperity, Micron' sale and profit skyrocket. The stock gener follow suit.That' what happen in 2012-2014. At the time, Micron had a a newfound price power thank toth recent complet buyout of bankrupt rival Elpida, and the compani use thi power to full effect. Hold back on product volumes, Micron shift the global supply-and-demand equat significantly, and memori price stabil in a big way:MUdata byYChartsRight now, Micron is knee-deep in yet anoth price war. Samsung is put the product pedal to the metal, not terribl worri about the effect thi market-flood action is have on memori prices. The Korean giant can afford to take some loss in an attempt to increas it market share, becaus memori chip are just a small part of a much larger technolog conglomerate.Micron doesn't have that luxuri to the same degree, as ani chang in memori price show up immedi on the bottom line. That effect ha kill plenti of vulner memori produc over the years. Thi is the largest risk, and it weigh heavili on Micron' credit rate and financi future.A cyclic market go, thi downturn shall eventu pass. One of these days, Samsung will have reach it intern market share goal and shift into profit-tak mode. Product volum go down, memori price stabil again, and the survivor of the last shakeout get to share anoth bonanza.Buy Micron today is a bet on thi compani make it to that next parti date. That' a bet I'm perfectli will to make, thank to Micron' robust cash balanc and solid cash flow even in the face of Samsung' worst market floods.Which stock should you buy?Intel and Micron play veri differ roles, but are both veri welcom part of my invest portfolio. Micron' next upturn will come, and Intel will continu to chug along like the unstopp juggernaut it is.If you'r on the sidelin of both stock today, one of these invest will be a much better fit for your invest strategi than the other.

Why Is Qualcomm Suing This Chinese Phone Maker?;10/28/2016;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , the largest mobil chipmak in the world, recent file patent infring suit against Chines smartphon makerMeizuin the U.S., Germany, and France. The chipmak previous file anoth suit against Meizu in China back in June.Qualcomm claim that Meizu is refus to negoti patent licens deal for the chipmaker' 3G and 4G technologies. Let' take a closer look at these disput patents, and whi they matter so much to Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Meizu.Th stori thu far...Qualcomm' patent licens (QTL) business, which gener the lion' share of it oper profits, own a massiv portfolio of wireless technologies. That portfolio enabl it to take a 3%-5% cut of the wholesal price of everi smartphon sold worldwide.That deal wa wide accept while smartphon sale were booming, but as price fell with the commodit of the market, smartphon maker complain that the royalti crush their alreadi thin margins. A recent Canaccord Genuiti report found that, out of all the smartphon maker in the world, onlyAppleandSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) gener signific profit from smartphon sales. In respons to Qualcomm' licens fees, mani OEM -- particularli in China -- start underreport shipment to pay Qualcomm lower licens fees.Instead of help Qualcomm, the Chines govern slap the compani with a $975 million antitrust fine, and forc it to lower it royalti rate last year. Qualcomm then had to renegoti new licens agreement with OEM on it own. Mani major Chines OEMs, includ market leadersHuawei,Xiaomi,Oppo, andVivo, all negoti new term with Qualcomm. The new agreement also includ back payment on previous underreport shipments.Whi won't Meizu work with Qualcomm?Meizu ship 20 million smartphon last year, make it one of the 12 biggest smartphon maker in the world. However, the compani is still dwarf by the top five smartphon maker in China -- Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Appl -- and onli ha a minim presenc in Western markets. Speak toDigit Trends, a Meizu spokesman claim that the compani wa work ""with Qualcomm to advanc toward an agreement,"" but that it respect ""Qualcomm' right to use legal measures.""Meizu doesn't use Qualcomm' Snapdragon chip in it handsets. It mainli put cheaperMediaTekchip for it lower-end devices, and Samsung' Exyno chip into it higher-end devices. Therefore, Meizumightsimpli be irrit that it ha to pay Qualcomm patent royalti when it doesn't actual use ani Qualcomm hardware. But more than likely, it' all about the number -- Meizu simpli can't squeez out a profit in the cutthroat Chines smartphon market if it lower it pricesandpay Qualcomm it desir cut.Qualcomm' lawsuit against Meizu are probabl intend to discourag other Chines OEM from follow the defiant OEM' example. Qualcomm alreadi resolv a similar disput withLGearli thi year, and it' simpli take step to ensur that OEM understand that refus to sign new licens agreement could lead to costli lawsuits.What thi all mean for QualcommQualcomm' clash with Meizu illustr how tough it can be for U.S. tech compani look to collect unpaid fee or royalti in China. It also show how the commodit of the smartphon market could eventu knock it QTL business, which gener 98% of it pre-tax profit last quarter, off track. As more OEM and govern regul protest Qualcomm' licens fees, it will like need to diversifi it patent portfolio into less matur markets.That' probabl whi Qualcomm recent agre to acquireNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , the biggest automot chipmak in the world, for more than $37 billion. That purchas would like add thousand of new automot and secur chip patent to Qualcomm' portfolio, breath fresh life into it QTL busi and decreas the unit' depend on smartphones. Therefore, the real stori here isn't about Meizu -- it' about the action Qualcomm must take to ensur that it QTL busi remain the company' core profit driver for year to come.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

It' not clear at thi point whether the iPhon SE will continu to be offered, but it seem like consid that the smallest iPhon 8 remain the current 4.7-inches.10th Anniversari iPhon 8 Could be a ""Smash"" HitAppl ha a histori of offer all-glass iPhones.

With it 10th anniversari release, Appl Inc. want the new iPhon to stand out from the crowd. It also want it to look visual differ from the 7 and 7 seri to spur upgrad who'v held onto their old iPhon becaus the new one look the same.Go back to the glass front and back, held togeth with a metal band, would kill two bird with one stone in that respect.

Winners and Losers of the Galaxy Note 7 Recall;10/27/2016;"BeyondSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , the Galaxi Note 7' discontinu will help and hurt other player throughout the smartphon industry, includ chip manufactur and other suppliers.In thi clip fromIndustri Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewi and Evan Niu, CFA, discuss who stand to win and who stand to lose.A full transcript follow the video.makeArticleAd();A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology. And we think it stock price ha nearli unlimit room to run for earli in-the-know investors! To be one of them,just click here.Thi podcast wa record on Oct. 14, 2016.Dylan Lewis:Evan, we talk about how the premium side of the smartphon market could see some shake-up. We might see some consum that were interest in the Galaxi line, mayb they were Galaxi Note owners, take thi opportun to either tri an iO device, mayb anoth Android device. Do you think there are ani big beneficiari with this?Evan Niu:I think there are definit some winner and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it' a littl bit shorter, becaus Samsung is mostli self-contain in term of it suppliers. Samsung is so directli integr that it make most of the compon that go to it phones. It still ha some third-parti part suppliers. But as far as suppli relationship go that might suffer from reduc unit volumes, it' mostli go to be within Samsung itself.Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) probabl lose a littl bit becaus the Snapdragon 820 is insid the U.S. variants...Lewis:Can you explain what the Snapdragon does?Niu:Snapdragon is the main applic processor that ha integr modem and all these things. It' one of the most part and piec of ani phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these differ variant for differ geographies. Samsung ha been tri to ship to it own in-hous Exyno processor. I think the last year, they were exclus Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but thi year, Qualcomm ha gotten back into the mix, they'v improv their chip a littl bit and got more competitive. There' some varianc for differ geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a littl bit, sinc they obvious won't be sell into thi phone anymore. But there' kind of a hedge, becaus Qualcomm doe sell a lot intoApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . If peopl buy iPhon instead of the Note 7, probabl increment neg to Qualcomm, but they'r not total out of the picture.Lewis:Right, you might be a littl pinched, but noth crazy.Niu:Right, there' a littl bit of a hedge, there' a silver lining. And of course, it depend on which iPhon you get, becaus not Qualcomm ha lost a littl bit of spot in the iPhone, becaus Qualcomm use to be the exclus modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Appl ha gone toIntel-- well, first time not includ Infineon 10 year ago. Now, thi year, Appl is now buy modem from Qualcomm and Intel, depend on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainli Apple.Lewis:Yeah, I think they'r up 10% sinc some of the product issu around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainli seem to think...Niu:Yeah, there wa alreadi iPhon 7 optimism, and now the share just keep go higher. They'r at 2016 high becaus of all thi stuff that' go on with Samsung. I think it' pretti clear that a lot of peopl are probabl go to try. And we'v alreadi been see Android switch rate continu to rise everi quarter. Appl tout thi everi quarter, everi quarter they'r like, ""Highest Android switcher rate ever."" I think that trend is go to continue, particularli with one of the biggest Android OEM hit into thi wall here.A mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that peopl are buy the phone with their modem, they benefit.Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) , I think, is a big winner here too. They actual just releas earn that were pretti strong. Taiwan semiconductor is produc Apple' A10 Fusion chip. Anoth chang thi year is that, in prior years, Appl had been dual sourc it chip manufactur from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which start one or two year ago. They onli brought on Taiwan semiconductor one or two year ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indic that we'r getting, it' exclus to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in term of the foundri busi on the chip manufactur side. That' a lot more chip that Taiwan Semi is go to be make for Apple. They just releas earnings, it wa pretti strong, came in abov expectations. I don't rememb the exact numbers. But the import thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor rais fourth quarter guidance, and that rais guidanc did not factor in the possibl of these other phone be discontinued. So they were alreadi super bullish, even befor factor in the Note 7' discontinu into their forecast. So, I think they'r realli go to bank thi holiday quarter if Appl sell enough phones. That' a ton of order go to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they'r probabl a pretti big winner here.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of peopl tend to read into the commentari we get from compon manufactur that go into the iPhon as a gener baselin for how that segment might be do when Appl report again. If you'r see guidanc up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probabl bode well for the iPhon business.Niu:Yeah. And even befor the Samsung Note -- that' what blew me away -- their guidanc wa so strong, and they liter said, ""Thi doe not includ ani impact if the Note 7 is discontinued,"" which it ha been. So, it look realli good for them. As far as third-parti carrier or retail are concerned, I think they'r pretti ambivalent. They'r just tri to do their best to help their custom not be in danger. Their brand aren't go to be affected, and they'r not go to be bear a lot of cost becaus Samsung is go to be pay for all of this. So most of the retail and carrier just want to do what' right for the custom and get these thing off the market. I don't think there' go to be ani damag to them.Dylan Lewisown share of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAown share of Apple. The Motley Fool own share of and recommend Appl and Qualcomm.

That work out to just 15 cent on everi $100 spent. That seem trivial compar to the $400 or so in profit the compani reap from the sale of everi iPhon 7. However, when you look at the big pictur - the huge potenti for mobil payment worldwid - the number can add up quickly.That $503 billion in U. in-stor payment in 2020 would repres more than $750 million in fee for AAPL if Appl Pay were used.That' just the U.S., and just in-store.Worldwid mobil payment are expect to hit $620 billionthi year.

However, in 2014, Appl chose to tapTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) to build the A8 chip that power the highli success iPhon 6 seri of phones.Th follow-on A9 processor wa dual-sourc from both Samsung and TSMC, with report suggest that Samsung had won most of the orders. Thi year' A10 Fusion processor is believ to be manufactur exclus by TSMC.PerDigiTimes, Apple' next-gener processor, which is like to be call the A11 Fusion, will be manufactur onli by TSMC.TSMC is the logic choic for A11It doesn't come as a big surpris that Appl is plan to build all the A11 Fusion chip at TSMC. TSMC' own public commentari around it expect market share dure the 10-nanomet gener strongli hint at this.Nevertheless, have more confirm is never a bad thing.To be perfectli blunt, all indic point to TSMC' have a stronger offer with it own 10-nanomet technolog than what Samsung will have avail at the time.TSMC' technolog should offer better chip area density, which mean that Appl can cram more featur and function into a given chip area than it could on the Samsung technology.Furthermore, given TSMC' track record here, I would expect it 10-nanomet technolog to offer superior performance, ultim allow Appl to deliv the same perform at lower power or more perform in the same power envelop as an equivalent, Samsung-built part.And finally, I have more confid in TSMC' abil to achiev good manufactur yield (thi impact cost and supply) on it 10-nanomet technolog in time for the iPhon 8 ramp than I do in Samsung's.TSMC' iPhon share should surg in 2017Dure the current iPhon cycle, TSMC should have the major share of Apple' A-seri busi sinc it ha 100% of the A10 order and a minor alloc of the A9 order (some report have peg TSMC' share of the A9 at 30%).However, there' clearli room for TSMC to grow it share sinc Samsung is like still suppli a good portion of the A9 chip that current power the low-cost iPhon SE and the mid-rang iPhon 6s-seri phones.If TSMC ha won 100% of the A11 orders, then it could achiev 100% share of Apple' applic processor orders, sinc the A10-pow iPhon 7-seri phone would becom Apple' mid-rang offering, and the iPhon SE will probabl get an updat in 2017, as well.Addit iPhon applications' processor share would ultim translat into higher revenu and profit for TSMC -- alway a good thing for stockholders.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

And we think it stock price ha nearli unlimit room to run for earli in-the-know investors! To be one of them,just click here.Thi podcast wa record on Oct. 14, 2016.Dylan Lewis:I think one of the other thing that make thi tougher -- and return back from thi a littl tougher -- is the product life cycl of smartphones. You look at a place likeChipotle, fast casual, they'r abl to give away a ton of free product via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get peopl back in restaur rel quickly, becaus meal are a routin purchas for people. Smartphon are not. You'r buy a phone everi two years. Onc you get someon in an ecosystem, the likelihood of them stay there is a lot higher. So, I worri there' go to be thi class of peopl come onto smartphones, or mayb peopl that recent decid to make the switch over to the Galaxi line, specif the Galaxi Note line, that they'r second-guess it, might go with anoth Android device, might decid to go over to someth on the iO side.Evan Niu:Yeah. That' exactli the thing they need to figur out. Samsung is realli good at hardware. Samsung ha tri so hard over the past 10 year to get better at software, but of course, they have to get Android fromGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and they do their whole modif and tweaks, thi stuff they put on top of it to tri to differentiate. But the point remain that Samsung isn't actual good at that stuff. Their softwar is not veri good. They'r realli good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardwar is have all these problems, there' realli not a good reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardwar ha been incred well-made. But now, there' no reason. If their one strength is now be call into question...Lewis:Peopl are go to go elsewhere.Niu:Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there' ton of realli good Android phone out there.Lewis:I think, to help adjust for thi a littl bit, Samsung is offer custom about $75 to trade in their devic for other Samsung models. That' a good retent effort. They might save some lost custom along the way. But it wouldn't be surpris to see some flight from the brand.On of the other reason I think thi is troubl is the time in the calendar year. Thi is ahead of the holiday season, and it' the biggest time of the year for consum electronics. To have to wipe out an entir product line ahead of the quarter where you'r probabl go to be do 40% of your business, at least ...Niu:And one of their most expensive, most profit products, too.Lewis:Yeah. That' rough, that' realli hard to deal with that, as a business.Niu:Yeah. Thi is the time, holiday shop season. Everyon make all their money here. And now, Samsung ha to pull one of their flagship...th Note 7 ha been a differenti compar to the iPhon for a long time, becaus it come with a stylus, it' bigger. It wa like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung ha establish itself as the phablet leader, andApplenow ha the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't have a stylus.

Apple Inc.’s Apple Watch Sales Are a Mess (AAPL);10/25/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsMarket research firm IDC just releas smartwatch sale number for the third quarter, and there' plenti of bad news forAppl Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and it Appl Watch.Source: AppleTh latest number show that the smartwatch industri as a whole is suffer steep declines. But AAPL is among the hardest-hit companies; sale of the Appl Watch plung over 70% year-over-year.makeArticleAd();Th question now is: Can Appl recover?Smartwatch Sale Take a DiveIt wa never clear whether there wa actual widespread consum demand for smartwatches. The whole categori began to take off afterPebblelaunch it record-set Kickstart campaign in 2012. However, to put thing in perspective,that campaign rais $10 million-plusand saw nearli 69,000 backers.In the grand scheme of things, those are minuscul numbers. Great for a startup like Pebble, but in retrospect mayb not an indic that consum in gener were readi to embrac the new product category.Add in the challeng of fit tracker compani that refus to give up.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) wa squar in the crosshair of the Appl Watch. Instead of roll over, Fitbit releas a new gener of trackers, some of which incorpor key smartwatch functionality. Namely, notifications.With consum more interest in track their health and fit than pay a consider premium to run app on their wrist,Fitbit' sale have defi predict and continu to grow.How to Trade Appl Inc. (AAPL) Stock AFTER EarningsMeanwhile, the smartwatch market is tanking.IDC' number for the third quarter showsmartwatch sale down by 51.6% compar to last year. Pebbl - the earli pioneer - saw it sale drop 54% to onli 100,000 units. What' particularli tell about that number is that it still allow Pebbl to place in the top five worldwid … AAPL took a beat with it sale off by 71.6%, a miser perform onli topped(?) byLenovo(OTCMKTS:LNVGY), which drop by a whop 73.3% compar to last year.Th two bright spot in the smartwatch market wereGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Garmin ha manag to posit itself as the smartwatch maker of choic for runners, leverag that strategi to a huge 324.2% sale growth and second place in the smartwatch market. Third place Samsung saw 9% growth.Can Appl Watch Sale Recover?Th big question is whether these poor sale result indic the air ha come out of the smartwatch market altogether, or if they'r more cyclical.Smartwatch sale have never live up to expectations. When the Appl Watch wa first released, some ""conservative"" estimatespredict sale in the 36 million rangefor the first year. Instead, AAPL sold roughli 12 million. Mayb the air wa never realli there in the first place.On the other hand, dure the last quarter, the smartwatch model avail for purchas were larg older models, with new version expect soon. The Appl Watch Seri 2 wa onli avail for sever week of Q3, so it sale don't realli come into play. Pebbl face the same issue, with the new Pebbl 2 arriv late in the quarter. Meanwhile,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) delay releas it Android Wear 2.0 oper system, result in some vendor hold off on releas their new smartwatches. Samsung announc the new Gear 3, but it is not yet for sale.So consum may have been hold off, wait for the new product to arrive.What ha becom obviou is that despit the initi hype, the smartwatch market is unlik to reach the mass market adopt level of the smartphone. As point out by IDC, ""It ha also becom evid that at present smartwatch are not for everyone.""How Appl Inc.

TSMC is far and away the market leader in contract chip manufacturing, and I believ that thi massiv revenu base rel to Samsung Foundri (and ani other of it contract chip manufactur peers, for that matter) allow it to be more aggress about invest in research and develop for futur technologies.Although I don't think TSMC' 10-nanomet yield right now are anyth to write home about (on it most recent earn call, manag said that the first product to be built on it 10-nanomet technolog ha been ""produc with reason yield"" -- not the word one would expect if yield were great), I strongli suspect that TSMC is further along on thi front than Samsung is.What Qualcomm may have done is implement Snapdragon 830 in both Samsung' and TSMC' 10-nanomet processes, respectively. Qualcomm clearli ha incent to build the first Snapdragon 830 chip at Samsung as the former is eager to get it chip insid of the latter' flagship Galaxi S seri smartphones.Lat on in the Snapdragon 830' life cycle, though, Qualcomm could dual-sourc the chips, ultim sell Samsung-built Snapdragon 830 chip to Samsung and some mix of Samsung- and TSMC-built Snapdragon 830 chip to other flagship Android phone makers.In thi case, win some of the Snapdragon 830 order would be a win for TSMC, sinc it wa complet shut out of the Snapdragon 820/821 generation.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

To be one of them,just click here.Thi podcast wa record on Oct. 14, 2016.Dylan Lewis:I'v seen [Alphabet's] Googl thrown around in the list of potenti winner as well. The idea is kind of similar withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) -- they releas the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Have a major potenti competitor off the tabl bode well for peopl give that a shot. That' not go to be someth that meaning contribut to the number for Google. I think, when you'r talk about Appl and Googl here, see Samsung falter and know that there might be a slightli larger bite of the smartphon market avail to them isn't someth that' thesis-altering. It' certainli interest for some of the compon manufactur that are specif in some of these devic and not others. But big picture, if you like Appl and Googl already, stick with them. But don't buy sole on the idea that they might pick up some increment busi here.Evan Niu:Yeah. The Pixel look like a pretti good phone. Of course, it' Google' first phone, they design the whole thing. They'r outsourc manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them design the phone itself, thi is the first time that they'r realli do the whole thing. It look like a realli good phone. I think, definitely, peopl that are not get the Note 7 might consid the Pixel, becaus it' a pure Googl phone stock Android without all the third-parti softwar and all thi stuff on it. But I think the biggest challeng there in term of get peopl to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatev the larg one is called, it' realli just about distribution. Googl doesn't have distribut channel in the way that most compani in the space do. They'r partner withVerizon, which is the onli carrier partner. Other than that, they'r sell it onlin through the onlin store. But, it might surpris you how mani people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store.Lewis:It becom kind of a default decision, right?Niu:Yeah. And it make some sense, becaus that' where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I person tend to buy thing online, and I think a lot of peopl do. But, carrier distribut is an incred import channel for ani phone maker. Peopl that alreadi know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of peopl don't know, and they still like to shop around, like ani other product in their lives, versu peopl like you and me are probabl so loyal that it' not even a decision, it' just, when am I go to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it' time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carrier other than Verizon, Pixel' not go to be there, becaus Googl is distribut themselves. It' harder for Googl to get these carrier relationship going, becaus the carrier want more control. It' harder for Googl to negoti becaus they'v never been a big player in the physic smartphon space. So I think the biggest thing that' go to hold them back is their lack of distribution.Lewis:It sound like the rundown for investor here is, Apple, Google, possibl beneficiaries. The peopl that might realli see some import swing in what goe on with their number are some of the compon manufactur like you talk about,Taiwan Semiconductor. My feel is, for Samsung' business, if they'r abl to keep the bad PR and neg brand associ contain to the Note line, then thi won't be someth that' realli aw for them long term. If it doe start to bleed into the other product they offer, the S7 and thing like that, it could spell troubl for their mobil segment for a long time.Niu:Yeah, the main thing is to figur out what the hell is go on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it ha the same thing, that would thesi altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figur it out, there' reason to think that there might be anoth one.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of consum want them to know exactli what' go on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice ralli in Samsung sales.Niu:They can't replic thi in their labs!

Let' crunch the number to find out.A closer look at the Gear VRSamsung offer the Gear VR, which usual cost $99, for free in variou promot to custom who purchas the S7, S7 Edge, and Note 7 earlier thi year. The Gear VR is also compat with older flagship devic like the Note 5, S6, and S6 Edge.SuperData estim that the Gear VR will have an instal base of about 2.3 million by the end of thi year, make it the second most popular VR headset afterSony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStat VR, which is expect to hit 2.6 million.Facebook is onli expect to sell 360,000 Oculu Rifts. That anem interest wa confirm by a recent Steam survey, which found that a mere 0.1% of the respond own a Rift. As a result, Facebook will still depend heavili on Samsung' devic to expand Oculu Home' reach for the forese future.Oculu Home on the Rift. Imag source: Oculu VR.Gaug the Note 7 impactBack in August, Hyundai Secur estim that shipment of the Note 7 could hit 12 million thi year. Meanwhile, Daishin Secur estim that Samsung could sell up to 25 million S7 and S7 Edg devic thi year. Base on those estimates, we can assum that Note 7 user would have account for about a third of the new Gear VR-compat user base by the end of the year.But that doesn't necessarili mean that the Note 7' demis will reduc Gear VR sale by a third. Mani Note 7 custom alreadi receiv the Gear VR as a free gift that they can still use with other flagship devices. Sale estim for the S7 and S7 Edg could also rise as the Note 7 disappears, in spite of the reputation-b the brand ha taken. Lastly, user of older flagship devic who don't own a Gear VR yet might buy the headset thi holiday season without buy a new phone.Therefore, I believ that the Note 7' failur should just be a bump in the road for the Gear VR, and probabl won't caus the headset to fall behind it pricier PC-base rivals.What doe thi all mean for Facebook?Thi whole incid reveal how much Facebook still depend on Samsung in the VR market. Facebook need Oculu Home to reach more users, becaus it retain a 30% cut on all VR content sales. Thi next-gen app store is basic Facebook' forward-think answer toAlphabet' Googl Play.Without Gear VR, Oculu Home would have a hard time gain momentum outsid the Rift' core demograph of affluent, hardcore-gam earli adopters. However, Samsung and Facebook could soon face tough competit in the mobil VR space when Google' Daydream, a similar VR ecosystem, arriv on more Android devices.Sinc Daydream is essenti a VR expans for Googl Play, it could margin Oculu Home out of the mobil market by spread to Samsung devices. The companion headset, the Daydream View, is also cheaper than the Gear VR at $79.The key takeawayTh real danger to Facebook' VR ambit isn't the Note 7' fieri flop. It' the company' depend on Samsung to retain a foothold in the higher-growth mobil VR market. Googl is tri to drive a wedg between the two compani with Daydream. If it succeeds, Facebook could find it veri difficult to expand it Oculu Home ecosystem without the back of a major mobil OS like Android.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good.Welcom toIndustri Focus, the podcast the dive into a differ sector of the stock market everi day. It' Friday, Oct. 14, and we'r talk about the fieri mess that is the Samsung Galaxi Note. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm join on Skype by Fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how' it going?Evan Niu:It' been a fun time to watch Samsung, consid I'v been a longtim Samsung skeptic.Lewis:We'r bothApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) guys, we'r both iPhon guys, so I think it' been comfort for us to know that the phone in our pocket are not go to spontan combust ani time soon, right?Niu:It' reassuring. (laughs) I'm not worri about my phone blow up.Lewis:On today' show, we'r go to give a littl rundown on what' been go on with Samsung and the Galaxi Note line over the last month-plus, how that line fit into the company' smartphon segment, and the company' financi in general. Then, which companies, if any, might benefit from some of the backlash and the recal of the Galaxi Note line.Evan, you want to get us up to speed, give us a littl timelin on what' been go on?Niu:Sure. Galaxi Note 7 launch in mid-August. I think that wa part of the deal -- Samsung wa realli want to beat Appl to market on timing, because, as everyon knows, iPhon come out in September. So, I think the compani wa realli push toward the timelin of get thi thing out to market as quick as possibl to tri to beat Appl to the punch. Which is kind of silly, becaus it' onli a month difference. How much of a differ could that make? But, apparently, that wa import to Samsung. I think that' partial what' led up to these problems, they cut corner or tri to do thing too fast. Thing obvious just weren't ready. Then, as we know, in earli and mid-September, we start to see report of Samsung Note 7 either explod or catch on fire, a lot of the time while they were charging. In general, sometim you hear stori about thi happening. When you'r use a third-parti charger that' not up to spec, that can sometim be the culprit. But these were the offici chargers, the regular Samsung charger you were suppos to be using.So, Samsung doe thi huge recall, 2.5 million units. They think they figur out that it' the batteri that they sourc in-hous from the Samsung SDI intern batteri division. So, they do thi recall. They leav all the other phone out there that have differ batteri from third-parti suppliers. They start replac phones. And now, all of the sudden, in the past week or two, the replac phone are now catch on fire. (laughs) So, everyth is a huge mess, and now they'v made the call to offici kill the project altogether. That' a tough call to make, but you have to do it when it' thi bad.It' crazy, becaus in modern smartphon times, peopl take thi stuff for granted. Befor thi one, you hadn't heard about an explod phone, or a phone catch on fire, meaningfully, in years. At least, not at thi scale, outsid of isol incidences, like the third-parti charger thing I wa talk about. But, you don't see thi wide-scal type of thing happening. It' been years. I think most consum have probabl thought that compani have figur thi out, but appar they haven't. It' kind of crazy.Lewis:Yeah, still run into some issu on the tech side. Thi is, I think, brutal bad timing, given that the compani is basic come off it best earn report in a coupl years. It seem like they had a ton of momentum, decent amount of growth in the smartphon space. Earlier thi week, when the compani decid to go with the full recall, they also issu an updat to guidance. So, we don't even realli have to specul as to what the financi hit might look like, we can look at exactli at what the compani said here. They are now expect third-quart oper profit to come in at 5.2 trillion South Korean won, which is roughli $4.6 billion, down from the origin forecast of 7.8 trillion won. So, a decent amount of rollback there. Third-quart revenu ha also been revis down. It' now expect to be about 47 trillion won from the previou guidanc of 49 trillion won.Niu:I think what' even more disconcert about thi whole thing is, Samsung still doesn't know what' wrong with the phones. They cannot figur it out. As recent as last week, there wa a New York Time report that their engin are still tri to replic the problem, and they can't. That doesn't inspir a lot of confidence. It' one thing if they do thi recall, they get the phone back, and they figur it out and presum fix it. But, if they don't even know what' wrong, that' a huge question mark. It realli call to question all these other thing about their futur phones. I don't think ani of their phone have had thi type of problem, but go forward, unless they can figur thi out and definit say, ""Thi is what caus it, and we have a solut ... ""Thi is total unrelated, but hilarious. They also had wash machin that are now blow up. I don't know if you saw that. A coupl week ago, there were report -- because, Samsung make everything, and they have these top-load wash machines, and those are now exploding. Clearly, it' a total differ thing, becaus those don't use lithium ion batteri like the phone do. But it' kind of like, what' go on with everything?! (laughs) Wash machines, too?Lewis:To layer on top of that, I think there are anoth coupl reason whi thi is a littl bit differ than your averag product recall, or even food-safety-rel issues, like what we'v seen withChipotleorJack in the Boxin the '90s. You talk about how they haven't been abl to diagnos the problem, which doesn't inspir a lot of confid in the other product they have out there.I think one of the other issu is, there' a lot of confus in the Galaxi line. You look out at Samsung' product offering, frankly, it' realli hard to keep all their phone straight. They intent move the Note to be on the 7 name convention, to keep it consist with the other offerings. Now, I think you'r see peopl that aren't 100% sure which product are safe, and which aren't. I saw news that they had to push notifications, I forget which product, but it wa one of their newer and higher-pr phones, that --Niu:It wa the regular S7.Lewis:Right. That, those were not part of the recall, and the peopl who held those in their hands, if they were read thi notification, didn't need to worri about that. That' fine, but when you have a super fragment offering, and a lot of the headlin are ""Galaxi 7,"" and they'r tri to distil it down to someth like that ...Niu:Yeah. For averag consum who don't follow thi stuff as close as we do, they just see some headlin about Galaxi something, 7 something. There' a Galaxi S7, there' a Galaxi S7 A, there' the Galaxi Note 7. There' so many, and they'r all part of the Galaxi brand that Samsung ha put so much money into building. They put ten of million of dollar into build thi brand over the past five or 10 years. And now, thi one horribl botch product risk kill all that brand value. It' not uncommon for Samsung to spend more money on marketing, advertising, kickbacks, commiss to retail and all that, than it doe on R&D. It put a ton of money into this, and now, becaus they'r unified, they'r all get drag down. They'r tri to contain thi thing, like you said, notif saying, ""Your phone is safe."" It sound exactli like the phone is not safe. But, ""The phone is safe, don't worry.""Lewis:I think one of the other thing that make thi tougher -- and return back from thi a littl tougher -- is the product life cycl of smartphones. You look at a place like Chipotle, fast casual, they'r abl to give away a ton of free product via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get peopl back in restaur rel quickly, becaus meal are a routin purchas for people. Smartphon are not. You'r buy a phone everi two years. Onc you get someon in an ecosystem, the likelihood of them stay there is a lot higher. So, I worri there' go to be thi class of peopl come onto smartphones, or mayb peopl that recent decid to make the switch over to the Galaxi line, specif the Galaxi Note line, that they'r second-guess it, might go with anoth Android device, might decid to go over to someth on the iO side.Niu:Yeah. That' exactli the thing they need to figur out. Samsung is realli good at hardware. Samsung ha tri so hard over the past 10 year to get better at software, but of course, they have to get Android from Google, and they do their whole modif and tweaks, thi stuff they put on top of it to tri to differentiate. But the point remain that Samsung isn't actual good at that stuff. Their softwar is not veri good. They'r realli good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardwar is have all these problems, there' realli not a good reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardwar ha been incred well-made. But now, there' no reason. If their one strength is now be call into question ...Lewis:Peopl are go to go elsewhere.Niu:Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there' ton of realli good Android phone out there.Lewis:I think, to help adjust for thi a littl bit, Samsung is offer custom about $75 to trade in their devic for other Samsung models. That' a good retent effort. They might save some lost custom along the way. But it wouldn't be surpris to see some flight from the brand.On of the other reason I think thi is troubl is the time in the calendar year. Thi is ahead of the holiday season, and it' the biggest time of the year for consum electronics. To have to wipe out an entir product line ahead of the quarter where you'r probabl go to be do 40% of your business, at least ...Niu:And one of their most expensive, most profit products, too.Lewis:Yeah. That' rough, that' realli hard to deal with that, as a business.Niu:Yeah. Thi is the time, holiday shop season. Everyon make all their money here. And now, Samsung ha to pull one of their flagship...th Note 7 ha been a differenti compar to the iPhon for a long time, becaus it come with a stylus, it' bigger. It wa like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung ha establish itself as the phablet leader, and Appl now ha the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't have a stylus. But other than that, it' pretti comparable, as far as giant phone go.Lewis:Yeah. I start briefli introduc what the compani wa expect for revenu writedown and revis guidance. It look like analyst were expect the compani to ship about 15 to 19 million unit from Q3 2016 through Q1 2017. To put that into context, Samsung ship between 75 million and 78 million smartphon last quarter. So, while thi is a big deal, it' a fanci new line they were realli tri to get some momentum behind, in the grander scheme of their product mix, it' actual mayb about 10% or so. I don't think it' as big of a deal as peopl realize.Niu:I think the big differ is, a lot of Samsung' volum come from these low-end, cheaper smartphon in place like India. They sell phone that are $50 to $100. They'r not make a lot of money on that, but they ship a lot of units, which help them keep their rank in the smartphon market. Like you mentioned, it' a lot more than Apple, 75 million on a non-holiday quarter, that' a ton of phones. But a lot of those are low-margin, low-valu unit versu these high-end phone -- that' where these compani make their margins. I think it ha a leverag effect, in that it seem smaller in term of units. But it had a pretti big impact on oper profits.Gener speaking, mobil is about half of Samsung' business, in term of revenu and oper profit, roughly, befor thi whole thing. Mobil includ a bunch of things, like tablet and these phones. But the mobil segment itself is incred import to them. Within the mobil segment if you look at the margin profil within their mobil business, these high-end phone are quit import in term of profitability. Those low-end phone get a lot of volume, but consid that Samsung is larg a hardwar player, if they sell a low-end phone to someone, it' not like they'r captur that custom on to their platform like Googl or Appl would be. They'r just tri to sell the phone. So, I think it won't have a huge impact on total volumes. But I think, again, come back to the brand, it' so damag for the brand. That' someth that' realli hard to put a number on right now -- brand valuation. I think that' the bigger thing here. Miss out on one product cycl is one thing, if it' contain within thi product cycle. But if there' last damag to the brand, they could be hurt for a long time.Lewis:I think that' whi you'v seen market reaction to thi actual not be so bad. Short-term, if we'r to take the compani at the guidanc that they'r giving, and we look at the product mix, and they'r abl to hold the volum on those other brands, the drop that we'v seen make sense. I think if you look back to when thi stori origin broke, the compani wa down about 4% or 5%, which realli isn't all that crazi given that thi is one of their most consumer-fac and high-profil lines. They do have so mani other offer in the smartphon market. If those hold, there shouldn't be too much of an issu there. One of the thing peopl might not realiz about Samsung is, they'r a littl bit more diversifi than your Apple, in term of the differ hardwar arena that they'v planned. To give you an idea of their revenu mix, consum electron is about 22% of revenue, and that doe not includ smartphones. IT and mobil communications, as you said before, a littl over 50% of revenue. Devic solutions, which is the semiconductor and display panel business, 36% of revenue. The IT and mobil is the highest-margin busi that they are in, and have a high-profil phone, a high-ASP phone (averag sell price), be removed, might lead to some margin compress there. But if they'r abl to hold on the other brands, I think thi mute reaction from the market make sense.Niu:Yeah, I guess we'll just have to see if they can success pull off thi crisi management. I think it' a good thing to kill those phones, definitely, especi when you don't know what' go on. You have to bite the bullet.Lewis:Absolutely. In the second half of the show, we'r go to hit briefli on a coupl compani that might be pois to benefit as Samsung goe into crisi mode.But befor we do, what if you could help combat global climat change, and make money at the same time?

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good.So, Evan, we talk about how the premium side of the smartphon market could see some shake-up. We might see some consum that were interest in the Galaxi line, mayb they were Galaxi Note owners, take thi opportun to either tri an iO device, mayb anoth Android device. Do you think there are ani big beneficiari with this?Niu:I think there are definit some winner and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it' a littl bit shorter, becaus Samsung is mostli self-contain in term of it suppliers. Samsung is so directli integr that it make most of the compon that go to it phones. It still ha some third-parti part suppliers. But as far as suppli relationship go that might suffer from reduc unit volumes, it' mostli go to be within Samsung itself.Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)prob lose a littl bit becaus the Snapdragon 820 is insid the U.S. variant --Lewis:Can you explain what the Snapdragon does?Niu:Snapdragon is the main applic processor that ha integr modem and all these things. It' one of the most import piec of ani phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these differ variant for differ geographies. Samsung ha been tri to ship to it own in-hous Exyno processor. I think the last year, they were exclus Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but thi year, Qualcomm ha gotten back into the mix, they'v improv their chip a littl bit and got more competitive. There' some varianc for differ geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a littl bit, sinc they obvious won't be sell into thi phone anymore. But there' kind of a hedge, becaus Qualcomm doe sell a lot into Apple. If peopl buy iPhon instead of the Note 7, probabl increment neg to Qualcomm, but they'r not total out of the picture.Lewis:Right, you might be a littl pinched, but noth crazy.Niu:Right, there' a littl bit of a hedge, there' a silver lining. And of course, it depend on which iPhon you get, becaus not Qualcomm ha lost a littl bit of spot in the iPhone, becaus Qualcomm use to be the exclus modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Appl ha gone toIntel-- well, first time not includ Infineon 10 year ago. Now, thi year, Appl is now buy modem from Qualcomm and Intel, depend on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainli Apple.Lewis:Yeah, I think they'r up 10% sinc some of the product issu around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainli seem to think --Niu:Yeah, there wa alreadi iPhon 7 optimism, and now the share just keep go higher. They'r at 2016 high becaus of all thi stuff that' go on with Samsung. I think it' pretti clear that a lot of peopl are probabl go to try. And we'v alreadi been see Android switch rate continu to rise everi quarter. Appl tout thi everi quarter, everi quarter they'r like, ""highest Android switcher rate ever."" I think that trend is go to continue, particularli with one of the biggest Android OEM hit into thi wall here.A I mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that peopl are buy the phone with their modem, they benefit.Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) , I think, is a big winner here too. They actual just releas earn that were pretti strong. Taiwan Semiconductor is produc Apple' A10 Fusion chip. Anoth chang thi year is that, in prior years, Appl had been dual-sourc it chip manufactur from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which start one or two year ago. They onli brought on Taiwan Semiconductor one or two year ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indic that we'r getting, it' exclus to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in term of the foundri busi on the chip manufactur side. That' a lot more chip that Taiwan Semi is go to be make for Apple. They just releas earnings; it wa pretti strong, came in abov expectations. I don't rememb the exact numbers. But the import thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor rais fourth-quart guidance, and that rais guidanc did not factor in the possibl of these other phone be discontinued. So they were alreadi super bullish, even befor factor in the Note 7' discontinu into their forecast. So, I think they'r realli go to bank thi holiday quarter if Appl sell enough phones. That' a ton of order go to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they'r probabl a pretti big winner here.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of peopl tend to read into the commentari we get from compon manufactur that go into the iPhon as a gener baselin for how that segment might be do when Appl report again. If you'r see guidanc up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probabl bode well for the iPhon business.Niu:Yeah. And even befor the Samsung Note -- that' what blew me away -- their guidanc wa so strong, and they liter said, ""Thi doe not includ ani impact if the Note 7 is discontinued,"" which it ha been. So, it look realli good for them. As far as third-parti carrier or retail are concerned, I think they'r pretti ambivalent. They'r just tri to do their best to help their custom not be in danger. Their brand aren't go to be affected, and they'r not go to be bear a lot of cost becaus Samsung is go to be pay for all of this. So most of the retail and carrier just want to do what' right for the custom and get these thing off the market. I don't think there' go to be ani damag to them.Lewis:I'v seen [Alphabet's] Googl thrown around in the list of potenti winner as well. The idea is kind of similar with Appl -- they releas the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Have a major potenti competitor off the tabl bode well for peopl give that a shot. That' not go to be someth that meaning contribut to the number for Google. I think, when you'r talk about Appl and Googl here, see Samsung falter and know that there might be a slightli larger bite of the smartphon market avail to them isn't someth that' thesis-altering. It' certainli interest for some of the compon manufactur that are specif in some of these devic and not others. But big picture, if you like Appl and Googl already, stick with them. But don't buy sole on the idea that they might pick up some increment busi here.Niu:Yeah. The Pixel look like a pretti good phone. Of course, it' Google' first phone, they design the whole thing. They'r outsourc manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them design the phone itself, thi is the first time that they'r realli do the whole thing. It look like a realli good phone. I think, definitely, peopl that are not get the Note 7 might consid the Pixel, becaus it' a pure Googl phone stock Android without all the third-parti softwar and all thi stuff on it. But I think the biggest challeng there in term of get peopl to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatev the larg one is called, it' realli just about distribution. Googl doesn't have distribut channel in the way that most compani in the space do. They'r partner withVerizon, which is the onli carrier partner. Other than that, they'r sell it onlin through the onlin store. But, it might surpris you how mani people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store.Lewis:It becom kind of a default decision, right?Niu:Yeah. And it make some sense, becaus that' where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I person tend to buy thing online, and I think a lot of peopl do. But, carrier distribut is an incred import channel for ani phone maker. Peopl that alreadi know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of peopl don't know, and they still like to shop around, like ani other product in their lives, versu peopl like you and me are probabl so loyal that it' not even a decision, it' just, when am I go to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it' time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carrier other than Verizon, Pixel' not go to be there, becaus Googl is distribut themselves. It' harder for Googl to get these carrier relationship going, becaus the carrier want more control. It' harder for Googl to negoti becaus they'v never been a big player in the physic smartphon space. So I think the biggest thing that' go to hold them back is their lack of distribution.Lewis:It sound like the rundown for investor here is, Apple, Google, possibl beneficiaries. The peopl that might realli see some import swing in what goe on with their number are some of the compon manufactur like you talk about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feel is, for Samsung' business, if they'r abl to keep the bad PR and neg brand associ contain to the Note line, then thi won't be someth that' realli aw for them long-term. If it doe start to bleed into the other product they offer, the S7 and thing like that, it could spell troubl for their mobil segment for a long time.Niu:Yeah, the main thing is to figur out what the hell is go on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it ha the same thing, that would thesi altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figur it out, there' reason to think that-ther might be anoth one.Lewis:Yeah, I think a lot of consum want them to know exactli what' go on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice ralli in Samsung sales.Niu:They can't replic thi in their labs! It' just crazy.Lewis:Anyth els befor I let you go, Evan?Niu:No, I think we hit it all.Lewis:Awesome.

3 Reasons Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Hitting Record Highs … Again;10/21/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsCongratul to anyon who' been a long-term investor ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). GOOG and GOOGL share reach new all-tim high thi week despit a market-wid headwind of late. GOOG stock' up 23% for the last twelv months, and is still forg it way deeper into unchart waters.Source:Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)Th credit for the latest round of bullish wa larg given to the company' new so-cal Pixel smartphone.makeArticleAd();And, it' admittedli an impress devic that wa fortuit unveil right around the same time rivalSamsung Electron KRW5000(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) announc it wastak it Galaxi Note 7 off the market due to a danger design flaw.To understand whi GOOG stock seem to repeatedli prompt thi ""new 52-week"" high stori though, one ha to take a step back and look at the compani through a more philosoph lens. There are three big reason Alphabet Inc is one of onli a few truli must-hav stocks.In no particular order:GOOGL Is Still a Primari Web-GatekeeperWith just a quick glanc at some of the data, it would be easi to conclud Googl - and by extension, Alphabet Inc - is perpetu en-rout to weaker results. The amount of revenu it collect everi time someon click on one of it ad ha beensteadili sink sinc 2012, larg reflect the rise of smartphones, where text and banner ad aren't as fruitful.16 Best Stock to Buy Under Presid Donald TrumpTh flipsid of that trend is that what GOOGL may have lost in price power it ha more than made up for in sheer volume. Dure the second quarter of thi year, while it cost-per-click wa down anoth 7%, the number of total click it induc wa up 29% on a year-over-year basis. The downtrend in cost-per-click valu simpli reflect the commodit of an internet-ad market that' still rapidli growing.And GOOG is win a share of that market as it migrat away from comput and toward handheld devices. As of the second quarter of thi year, Alphabet Inc' Android oper system wa on arecord-break 87.6% of smartphon ship that quarter.That OS is essenti free to user sinc it' more valuabl to GOOGL as a platform to sell other products, like ad and apps.Alphabet Inc' Innov ImproveCal a spade a spade, while the Nexu line of smartphon thatfirst debut in 2010(posit as a Googl product, but actual made by HTC) wa a respect player in a tough arena, none of it iter were truli a match for the far more popular iPhon series, fromAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). As your truli ha mention more than onc over the year though, it' onli a matter of time befor competitor meaning copi a proven technology.Ent the Pixel smartphone, from GOOG.Th review are in, and thesmartphon expert love it- even the one who usual love to love the iPhon and love to hate Google. It may well have the veri best camera ever put on board a smartphone, and the built-in Googl Assist take dead aim at Apple' Siri. It' be (legitimately) pose as a potenti iPhon killer.Here' the thing … it' not just the smartphon that Alphabet Inc tweak and tweak until it came up with someth awesome: That' how it see and treat mani of it product and services.GOOG Is Not Afraid to Enter New ArenasBack in 2012, when GOOGL first start to lay it own fiberopt cabl to deliv super-high-spe internet servic to select cities, some felt the compani wa wast time and money. Broadband wa alreadi ubiquitous. It wa never about oper a profit ISP though. The invest wasmor of a messag to exist internet servic providersto step up their game and offer a servic that ultim benefit Alphabet Inc (and boost the valu of GOOG stock) in other ways.However, it' not just fiberopt servic - just as it' not a smartphon for the sake of sell smartphones.GOOGL is work on sever seemingli unrel and unfruit projects, includ drones, self-driv car and even medic technology, perhap without even know fulli where those effort are headed. It simpli know the futur won't look like the present, and there' valu in prepar for multipl contingencies.Advanc Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is a Long-Term PowerhouseCas in point? While the Googl Chromecast television-watch tool wa alway interesting, it wa never especi well-receiv rel to Appl TV or the Roku. Now, we know that wa all lead to a Google-brand ""skinny"" cabl televis package. Just thi week, Alphabet Inc announc it had ink a deal to makeCB Corporation(NYSE:CBS)on of the content provid for it new web-bas TV service.Bottom Line for GOOG StockI GOOG stock bulletproof? No, in the same sens GOOGL now pose a real threat to Appl and tradit cabl televis companies, other outfit can and will pose a challeng to it in the future. Alphabet Inc isn't a compani that ever becom complac or comfort though, and it embrac chang rather than resist it, even when it' not clear where those chang are headed.It' a rare seen philosophi that ha been regularli prod GOOG stock to new 52-week high sinc 2012, and really, well befor that.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Blue-Chip Stock You Should Sell Right Now16 Best Stock to Buy Under Presid Hillari ClintonTh post3 Reason Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Hit Record High … Againappear first onInvestorPlace."

This High-Growth Business Is a Massive Opportunity for Apple;10/18/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) depend heavili on the iPhon when it come to sale and earnings, but the servic divis is becom an increasingli import growth engin for the company. Both from a quantit and qualit point of view, servic could be a power return driver for investor in Appl go forward.makeArticleAd();A huge and grow businessWhen look at Apple' financi statements, the iPhon gener the lion' share of revenue. The compani made over $24 billion in sale from the iPhon dure the third quarter of fiscal 2016 (the quarter end in June of thi year), account for a massiv 57% of total revenue.However, servic are rapidli gain ground. The servic divis includ revenu from the iTun Store, the App Store, Appl Pay, Appl Music, and other services. Thi busi gener almost $6 billion in sale last quarter, and it' now the company' second-biggest divis behind the iPhone, account for nearli 14% of total revenue.To put these number in perspective,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) gener $6.2 billion in sale dure the second quarter of 2016, andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) ha recent report $2.1 billion in total revenu for the third quarter of the year. Thi mean that Apple' servic divis is nearli as big as Facebook, and almost three time bigger than Netflix.Even more importantly, the servic divis is fire on all cylinders, with revenu grow 19% versu the third quarter in fiscal 2015. The App Store wa a particularli strong driver last quarter, with revenu grow 37% year over year. Appl produc $23.1 billion from the servic busi in the 12-month period end in June, up by $4 billion dure the past year. Accord to management, the servic segment is on track to becom the size of a Fortun 100 compani next year.In stark contrast, revenu from the iPhon and the Mac contract by 23% and 13% respectively, and iPad sale grew by a modest 7% year over year last quarter. Thi mean that servic are outgrow the rest of the busi and gain particip in the overal revenu mix.Hardwar sale are typic quit volatile, as they depend on new product launch and other product-cycl considerations. Perform in the iPhon busi could easili improv go forward, especi sinc Appl launch it new iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu model in September, and the compani could materi benefit fromSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) discontinu the Galaxi Note 7.Nevertheless, even if other segment will probabl improv in the come quarters, everyth indic that the servic segment will continu outgrow other busi over the midterm, and thi should have a posit impact on overal revenu growth.Appl doe not disclos profit margin for specif busi segments, but servic are typic more profit than product sales. Base on data for 2015, invest bank Piper Jaffray estim that Apple' gross margin in servic could be abov 60%, substanti higher than the gross profit margin that Appl typic make on a whole-compani level (it' in the neighborhood of 40%).Beyond the numbersOn of the main uncertainti factor affect Appl is lack of growth visibility. Hardwar compani are typic valu at consider discount versu the overal market becaus demand in the industri is quit unstabl and cyclical. Besides, the iPhon market is matur and market penetr level are much higher than in the past, so Appl can't be expect to gener from the iPhon the same kind of perform it produc when the devic wa still an emerg technology.Servic are a whole differ story, though. Revenu in thi segment depend on the size of the instal base, not so much on product sale over a particular quarter. For thi reason, it make sens to expect a smoother growth trajectori from Appl in servic than in other busi segment relat to product sales.In addition, servic play a key role from a competit perspective. As custom becom entrench in Apple' ecosystem of servic and applications, they are more like to remain loyal to the company' products. If you are activ engag with Appl Pay and Appl Music, chanc are you will go for anoth iPhon when it' time to replac your smartphone.Th iPhon will most probabl remain Apple' biggest segment over the come quarters, but the servic divis is grow at full speed and gain particip in the overal revenu mix. Thi is not onli import from a quantit perspective, but a larger share of revenu and profit come from servic would make overal financi perform more stabl and easier to predict go forward. Investor in Appl have a lot to gain if the compani can sustain rapid growth in the servic busi over the year ahead.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

No, Apple Inc.'s OLED Plans Aren't on Hold;10/18/2016;"Imag source: Getty.Ov onSeek Alpha(fre membership required), contributor Nikhil Gupta offer up some commentari around a recent articl in Nikkei, particularli as it relat toApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) display sourc plans. The Nikkei piec said that Foxconn and Sharp, the former have recent taken a larg equiti stake in the latter, will begin mass product of organ light emit diode, or OLED, display for smartphon in 2019.makeArticleAd();Curr Appl iPhon use liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, but the iDevic maker is expect to be activ work to make sure the technolog and supplier infrastructur is in place for a transit to OLE displays. Appl is expect to adopt OLE technolog on a premium model that sit abov the 5.5-inch iPhon Plu model in the company' 2017 product lineup, per aprevi reportfrom Nikkei.So what doe thi have to do with Gupta' comments? In hi article, he argu that ""with the recent fiasco ofSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi Note 7 catch fire, and with reason still unknown, Appl would not risk procur OLE display from Samsung.""Th implication, then, is that if Appl ha to wait for Foxconn and Sharp to get their act togeth in OLEDs, Apple' plan to releas a premium iPhon next year with an OLE display may be in tatters.That' not go to happen; here' why.Display don't explodeIt' veri like that the Galaxi Note7' issu are, in some way, relat to the batteri inside. After all, itisth batteri that are exploding. The problem may not be due to faulti batteri pack themselves, but perhap there is an issu with the design of the phone and how it interact with the batteri that caus those problems.I don't think it' reason to blame the display itself.Us Samsung-built display should be fineTh realiti of the situat is that Samsung Display is one of the onli companies, if not the onli one, capabl of build OLE display that can be use in high-volum smartphon today. Even LG, a major manufactur of displays, still use LCD in it flagship smartphon -- thoughLG Display(NYSE: LPL) isreportedlymak signific invest to enabl a shift to flexibl OLE at some point.Not onli should Appl be fine with use Samsung-built OLE displays, but if Appl want to ship an iPhon with an OLE display dure the second half of 2017, it might not have ani choic but to sourc -- at least initi -- from Samsung.Appl won't be tie to Samsung forever, thoughAppl is unlik to be happi to be tie to Samsung fortoolong, particularli given that the two compani are fierc competitor in the world of smartphones. The iDevic maker is sure go to work to enabl other display manufactures, such as Foxconn/Sharp, as well as longtim LCD supplier Japan Display, to becom import OLE display supplier over time.Indeed, it' pretti tell that Appl reportedli plan on onli adopt a curv OLE display in a singl ultra-premium model rather than across the board. With so few viabl supplier of mobil OLE display today, the price that Samsung can charg are like substanti higher than what Apple' mobil LCD supplier can.Thi mean that from both a margin perspective, as well as simpli a suppli avail perspective, Appl probabl can't transit it entir iPhon lineup to OLE until later on.Onc all of the major mobil display vendor are abl to success produc mobil OLE to Apple' specifications, price on mobil OLE should come down -- a posit for display buyer such as Appl and a potenti neg for Samsung' mobil OLE margin and/or share at Appl for the longer term -- though the market opportun is like to be much larger as the supplier base grows.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Sinc then, Appl ha continu to improv the Siri experi and roll it out to all it iO devices, the Appl TV, Appl Watch and Mac computers. But those improv have been increment - Siri' capabl haven't taken a great leap forward.A one of the earli exampl of mass market artifici intelligence, Siri did well, but AAPL' person digit assist ha been fall behind.Appl CEO Stand Up for Gay Right in the Work PlaceRivalsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and especiallyAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have invest heavili in AI, machin learn and the massiv server infrastructur need to support advanc the field.A a result, in the time sinc Siri first appeared, Apple' person digit assist ha in mani way been left behind by the competition: Cortana, Alexa, Googl Now and the latest, Googl Assistant.

178 Billion Reasons to Buy Apple;10/15/2016;"Imag source: The Motley Fool.Accord to the recent releas 2016 Best Global Brand Rank from Interbrand,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the most valuabl brand in the world, with an estim market valu of $178 billion. These kind of rank and valu estim are alway a matter of discussion, but it' hard to argu the fact that Appl is world-class brand, and thi ha import implic for investor in the company.makeArticleAd();Th valu of a brandInvest in compani with strong brand valu can be a power strategi for superior return over the long term. When a compani ha a differenti brand, thi mean custom are will to buy that company' product over product from the competit offer a similar price and quality. Thi protect the busi from competit pressure, and it can also mean above-averag price power, which ha a posit effect on the company' profit margins.Interbrand implement a holist approach that includ both quantit financi data and subject consider for valu a brand. Financi analysi incorpor variabl such as after-tax oper profits, minu a charg for the capit use to gener the brand' revenu and margins. Interbrand also includ other aspect such as the portion of the purchas decis attribut to the brand, as oppos to factor like price and product features. When it come to measur brand strength, the consult firm also evalu the brand' abil to to creat loyalti and sustain demand in the future.On the other hand, the Forb Brand Rank put more weight on financi consider than Interbrand. Accord to Forbes: ""We measur the valu of a brand by look at the financi instead of fuzzi consum surveys. The most valuabl brand are one that gener signific earn in industri where brand play a major role.""Forb also consid Appl the most valuabl brand in the world, with a calcul valu of $154 billion. Interestingly, both Interbrand and Forb put competitorAlphabet' Google(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) brand in the second posit among global brands. Interbrand estim that the Googl brand is worth $133 billion, while Forb ha a more conserv valuat of $82.5 billion for Google.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is anoth top player in the industry, even if the compani is face a massiv blow after theSamsung Galaxi Note 7 disaster, which will probabl take a consider toll on Samsung' brand value. Interband put Samsung in the seventh global position, with an estim valu of $51.8 billion. When it come to the Forb Brand Ranking, Samsung is rank in the 11th place, with a brand valu calcul at $36.1 billion.How brand valu benefit investor in AppleTh consum electron industri is notori challeng and competitive, and most compani in the sector oper with razor-thin profit margins. Global smartphon demand is slow down thank to market satur across the world, and research firm IDC ha recent cut it growth forecast for the industri to an anem increas of 1.6% in shipment dure 2016. In thi context, mani smartphon manufactur are aggress cut price to protect market share, which is hurt profit margin across the board.However, you wouldn't have guess that by look at Apple. Even if the compani is face declin revenue, the busi still gener enorm profit for investor dure challeng times. Accord to data fromMorningstar, Appl produc an oper profit margin around 28.5% of revenu dure the 12-month period end in June of 2016. Thi is more than doubl the 12.8% oper margin produc by Samsung in the same period, and the profit gap will probabl increas over the come month becaus of the problem Samsung is face with the Galaxi Note 7.Base on data from financi servic compani Cannacord Genuity, Appl captur a stagger 75% of all oper profit in the smartphon industri dure the second quarter of 2016. Thi is in spite of the fact that the compani account for a rel small 11.7 % smartphon unit sale dure the period. Becaus Appl launch the new iPhon 7 in September, and becaus Samsung is suffer a major setback, chanc are good that Appl will grab an even larger share of profit in the industry.It' hard to object calcul how much a brand like Appl is worth, so investor need to take these estim with a grain of salt. However, the main point to consid is that brand valu is a crucial return driver for investor inAppl stock.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc.'s Surprisingly Strong Mid-Range iPhone Offering;10/15/2016;"Imag source: Apple.WheneverApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) releas new flagship smartphones, the prior-gener model are usual discount by $100. Thi effect make last year' Appl flagship into thi year' mid-rang offering, allow Appl to particip at a wider rang of price point than it would have otherwis been abl to.makeArticleAd();Thi strategi ha work reason well for Appl as it flagship devic tend to be advanc enough to success inhabit those mid-rang price point but not so advanc so as to diminish the valu proposit of the flagship model.Although the iPhon 6S and iPhon 6S Plu were disappoint seller as flagship (Appl saw it first-ev iPhon sale declin dure thi product cycle), as thi year' mid-rang offerings, they are probabl the most competit product that Appl ha ever had at these price points.iPhon 6S and iPhon 6S Plu still competit with Android flagshipsIn prior generations, it'd have been hard to make the case that Apple' previou gener phone were, in meaning ways, superior to flagship devic from major Android-bas competitors. However, thi year it' not a hard case to make at all.Th A9 processor insid of the iPhon 6s and iPhon 6s Plu offer better single/du core CPU perform than what can be found in ani other Android smartphon accord to the Geekbench 4 perform test (Android flagship have the A9 beaten on multicor performance, but per-cor perform is gener more import for the user experience).Both the iPhon 6S and the iPhon 6S Plu also incorpor Apple' 3D Touch functionality. Similar technolog have begun to pop up in a few Android smartphones, but the major flagship from well-known brand such asSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , LG, and HTC have yet to incorpor a similar featur (though I suspect they will in due time).Appl also wise opt to increas the amount of storag that it offer in these price-reduc iPhon 6S devices. The base iPhon 6S and iPhon 6S Plu model now come with 32 gigabyt of storag and 128 gigabyt in the higher price tier.Thos storag increases, coupl with the price cuts, should dramat improv the valu proposit of these former-flagships-turned-mid-rang phones.Th iPhon 6S and iPhon 6S Plu aren't ahead of current Android flagship in everi respect, though. The iPhon 6S and iPhon 6S Plu are behind in term of display resolution, cellular performance, and the cameras.That be said, the fact that Apple' year-old flagship are as competit as they are could help the compani gain some share at lower price point against the Android makers.iPhon 7 and 7 Plu should hold up extrem wellI believ that thi year' iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu are much more competit as flagship devic than the iPhon 6S and iPhon 6S Plu were when they were Apple' top devices. Assum that Apple' competitor don't advanc their phone at a quicker pace than they did in between the iPhon 6S and iPhon 7, then I could actual see the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu hold up even better against Android flagship post-iPhon 8 launch than the iPhon 6S and iPhon 6S Plu are now.And, for Apple, gain smartphon share while keep it averag sell price healthi (Apple' mid-rang phone start at $549) is critic to allow it iPhon busi to deliv profit growth. Increasingli strong mid-rang offer should allow Appl to do just that.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc. Stock Rests On iPhone 7 Demand (AAPL);10/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(AAPL) stock ha been on a nice tear of late as analyst have harp onSamsung's(SSNLF) trash (the explod Note 7) as Apple' treasure.Th iPhon maker' sharesfin had a tough time on Thursday, but they bounc back quickli on Friday as the countdown to the next earn report is on. iPhon 7 sale will be a key compon ofAppl stockov the next sever months.makeArticleAd();Appl Stock Target UppedTh Septemb quarter ha just a short time cover iPhon 7 sales. Thi is pretti typic of Septemb quarters, although thi year' quarter ha more sale day for the newest handset compar to the year-ago quarter with the iPhon 6s. While there are alway differ in iPhon unit estim among analysts, thi year there seem to be an except wide berth where headlin are concerned.Morgan Stanley(MS) analyst Kati Huberti bump up her price target for Appl stock by $1 per share to $124 per share base on better-than-expect iPhon 7 demand. While she said that their higher iPhon estim in the near term are alreadi mostli bake into Appl stock, she ad that she' get more confid that the iPhon 7 cycl will drive ""meaningful"" revis to estim and push the share toward her $162 bull case.Indeed, the headlin here fall into one of two categories: ""iPhon 7 sale are better than expected"" or ""iPhon 7 sale are weak."" Of cours Huberti fall into the former categori and ha for a long time.Apple' Estim Also IncreasedTh analyst increas her estim for Apple' fourth fiscal quarter, as she believ the featur of thi year' new phone are ""compel enough"" to result in a ""record number of switcher and decent number of refreshers"" off Apple' current instal base of more than 600 million iPhones. She believ that the dual-len camera on the iPhon 7 Plu and ""to a lesser extent,"" Samsung' Note 7 recal are shift the iPhon mix toward the larger of the two phones, thu boost the averag sell price and margins.10 Stock That Everi Investor Should OwnHuberti estim that everi 10-point increas in iPhon 7 Plu mix will add $20 to the averag sell price, rais the gross margin 15 basi point and add 1 or 2 cent to Apple' earn per share. She believ the compani will come in toward the high end of guidanc becaus iPhon 7 demand appear strong but suppli is limited. As a result, she bump up her iPhon unit estim from 43 million to 44 million and move her averag sell price estim from a declin of 7% to a declin of 3% due to greater demand and better mix.However, she cut her iPad unit estimates. She now peg Apple' Septemb quarter at $47.2 billion in revenue, $1.65 per share in earnings, and a 38% gross margin, which are in line with consensus. They'r also close to the high end of management' guid for $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion in revenu and 37.5% to 38% gross margin. While she see thi year as shape up well already, she call fiscal 2018 the real supercycle.Whil Appl bear are rel few compar to the gener bullish that ha surround the compani for some time, they do exist. One such exampl isForbescontributor Bert Dohmen ofDohmen Capital, who said that iPhon 7 sale are so poor that Appl didn't even releas first week sale as it ha in the past.However, the compani ha said that suppli is the problem rather than demand, although thi is someth we won't know until we see unit number for the Septemb and Decemb quarter (but mostli December).Dohmen argu that Appl won't end up be themain beneficiari of Samsung' Note 7 debaclebecaus he believ that consum who have had a Galaxi phone won't return to the ""Appl 'eco-jail.'"" He also note that a ""rel small number of people"" use the Note, which is also a veri larg device.Th Love Stori Is Over for Twitter Inc (TWTR)A a result, he suggest that Note 7 user may be more like to turn to other Android devic such asAlphabet Inc's(GOOGL) new Pixel phones.Appl stock edg upward by as much as 0.28% to $117.31 dure regular trade hour on Friday, and close ahead 0.56% at $117.62 per share.Th postAppl Stock Rest On iPhon 7 Demand, Earn Even More Nail-bitingappear first onValueWalk.Mani academ claim invest is a ""random walk.""

Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. May Have Just Confirmed Apple Inc. A12 Win;10/14/2016;"Imag source: TSMC.Back in 2015, it wa reveal thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had decid to sourc the A9 applic processor that power the iPhon 6s and iPhon 6s Plu from bothTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .makeArticleAd();Thi wa view as someth of a blow to TSMC, as the compani wa previous the exclus manufactur of Apple' A8 chip.Sinc then, TSMC' execut appear to have improved. It is wide believ to be the sole manufactur of Apple' A10 Fusion chip insid of the recent releas iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plus. It is also expect to be the sole manufactur of next year' A11 processor, particularli in light of management' comment that it will have in excess of 70% foundri market share at the 10-nanomet node.Bas on commentari from TSMC' third-quart earn call, it look as though it might have won the entireti of Apple' A12 order as well.TSMC expect substanti share at 7 nanometersWhen an analyst ask TSMC' execut about what kind of share the chipmak expect to have dure the 7-nanomet technolog generation, co-CEO Mark Liu had the follow to say, accord to a transcript fromSeek Alpha [sign-in required]:High. We'd say high. Higher than 10-nanometer. We want to do everi node higher than the previou node.Bas on thi comment, and assum that the A12 chip will be manufactur in a 7-nanomet process rather than a 10-nanomet one (and I believ thi is a safe assumpt to make), it stand to reason that TSMC ha won the entireti of the Appl A12 contract.Additionally, sinc the 7-nanomet node is expect to be TSMC' lead edg technolog until around 2020 (when it roll out it 5-nanomet technology), Appl will like build the A13 on TSMC' 7-nanomet technolog as well.And, given that Appl is respons for a substanti amount of revenu and unit shipment on a given technolog node, it would be veri hard for TSMC to have ""higher than 10-nanometer"" share if it weren't the exclus manufactur of the A13.Impact businessesFor TSMC, thi is like good news for a coupl of reasons. First of all, Appl doesn't tend to reduc the size of it chip much, instead opt to use the addit chip area that new manufactur technolog bring to add features/performance. Given that 7-nanomet wafer will almost certainli be more expens than 10-nanomet wafer (which in turn are like to be more expens than 16-nanomet wafers), I expect TSMC' dollar content from the applic processor within futur iPhon to continu to move upward.Beyond that, though, to the extent that Apple' iPhon unit shipment grow, so too should TSMC' revenu from Apple.Th main loser here isSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , which is a competitor to TSMC in contract chip manufacturing. Appl use to be a major anchor custom for Samsung' contract chip manufactur business, but it would appear that thi busi is gone in the near-to-medium term -- and potenti for good.Further, if TSMC' share project are accurate, Samsung foundri custom likeQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) might be plan to jump ship -- in whole, or in part -- to TSMC at the 7-nanomet node.Fortun for Samsung, contract chip manufactur is a veri small part of it nearli $40 billion chip busi (IC Insight estim Samsung' contract chip busi at less than $3 billion in revenu dure 2015), let alon it total business, so lose out to TSMC isn't realli a ""game changer"" for Samsung' busi or it stock price.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Sales: Don't Be Misled;10/14/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha a lot ride on it recent releas iPhon 7 smartphones. The company' iPhon product categori isbi far it most important, and after see year-over-year shipment and revenu declin dure the iPhon 6S cycle, the compani need the iPhon 7 to do well.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, there have been sever report claim that Apple' iPhon 7 shipment dure the second half of 2016 might actual come in lower than shipment of the iPhon 6S in the prior year.That might make it seem as though sale of the iPhon 7 are actuallyworsethan what the iPhon 6S wa abl to deliv last year. However, investor need to realiz that thi isn't necessarili the case at all. Here' why.Appl over-ship last time; Appl seem suppli constrain thi timeWith the iPhon 6S, Appl like built and ship iPhon 6S devic under the assumpt that the then-new devic would sell better in the marketplac than the prior gener iPhon 6. When it wa clear that the end-demand wasn't there, Appl wound up cut iPhon 6S product and reduc the number of phone that it ship to it channel/distribut partners.That channel inventori reduct led to Appl meaning reduc it own iPhon 6S shipment dure the first half of thi year.Th initi build plan around the iPhon 7 were like inform by Apple' experi with the peak sale of iPhon 6s. It' not surprising, then, that Appl had origin plan to build fewer iPhon 7 unit dure the second half of 2017 rel to what it built of iPhon 6S unit in the second half of 2016.Those initi build plan don't realli say much about end demand.What is telling, though, is that in light of the reduc build year over year, Appl doesn't appear to have reach supply-demand equilibrium; instead, mani model -- particularli the iPhon 7 Plu model in black and jet black finish -- are still difficult, if not impossible, to find at Appl retail store (and ship time on Apple' onlin store are veri long for these models).Mi bet? iPhon 7 will do better than iPhon 6SAlthough it' too soon to say for sure, I have a suspicion that the iPhon 7 seri of smartphon will do better than the iPhon 6S did when it wa Apple' flagship. Not onli are the new phone more competit than their predecessor were in term of featur and compon performance, but Appl also ha the benefit of mani of those iPhon 6 owner (and given how success thi phone was, there were like a lot of them) potenti be in the market for upgrades.There' also the fact thatSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , arguabl Apple' toughest competitor, recent can it Galaxi Note 7 line of smartphones, which would have compet with Apple' iPhon 7 Plus. Some analyst think that Samsung' stumbl here could lead to unit shipment upsid for Apple, though that remain to be seen.Th iPhon 7 seem like it is good enough to allow Appl to do well over the next year while the compani prepar what it wide expect to be a ""revolutionary"" next-gener iPhon 8.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

That' the lesson thatSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is grappl with right now, even as the South Korean conglomer ha it hand full with the logist of a global recal for it Galaxi Note 7. Over the years, Samsung ha investedten of million of dollarsinto marketing. The world of advertis is similar to the world of politics: Money matters. A lot.makeArticleAd();A Galaxi phone by ani other name would not be as flammableTh compani ha built up it Galaxi brand, differenti it devic from the rest of the Android camp. Over time, it expand the lineup into differ sub-brands, each cater to specif use case such as the recent Galaxi S7 Activ that is intend for -- you guess it -- physic activ users. There are liter dozen of other examples.Th troubl now is that the Galaxi brand is significantli tarnished, and mani averag consum may not be abl to distinguish among all the differ sub-brands, particularli in the face of all the neg publicity. It doesn't help that mani of these model often share the same numer gener in the model name. Peopl keep see explos headlin about a Samsung phone with ""Galaxy"" and ""7"" in the name. That may concern custom who own a Galaxi S7 or a Galaxi S7 Edge.Som Galaxi are safeIn an effort to proactiv contain the brand fallout, Samsung ha begun send push notif to custom that own these other seemingli relat but safe devices. For example, aTechnoBuffalostaff member receiv the follow message: ""Your Galaxi S7 is not an affect device. The Galaxi S7 is not subject to recall. You can continu to use your devic normally.""It' not clear if Galaxi S7 Edg owner are receiv the same message.

All Galaxi Note 7 custom should heed these warn consid the safeti concern associ with a carri a devic in your pocket that risk spontan combusting.How much is your loyalti worth?Samsung is will to pay for loyalty, too, as it is now offer $75 if custom opt to trade in their fieri devic for a differ Samsung model. That' on top of a $25 bill credit that some carrier are offer for the exchange, which bring the total rebat to $100. But that $25 is avail even if custom switch to anoth brand, so Samsung is realli tri to buy loyalti for just $75.Loyalti is a rare commod within the Android camp, as there are plenti of other Android phone that are just as good -- if not better -- than Galaxi devices. The peac of mind of buy a non-explod phone should be worth more than $75.Time may not heal all woundsThere' alreadi evid that the Galaxi brand is suffering.Busi Insiderreport that YouGov BrandIndex is alreadi see measur declin in two import brand metrics.

Apple Inc.'s Got a Big Watch Problem;10/13/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Just a few month ago,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made a coupl of announc around it Appl Watch product category. In a nutshell, it releas a new Appl Watch Seri 2 devic with improv internals, a better screen, water resistance, and integr GPS. It also updat the intern of the origin Appl Watch to includ the same processor as the one found in the Appl Watch Seri 2 but kept the design and the display larg similar.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, accord to an Augustreportfrom Bloomberg, Appl want to includ cellular connect in a futur Appl Watch, but one of the challeng it face is keep batteri life in check.Indeed, Bloomberg say that ""current cellular chip consum too much batteri life, reduc the product' effect and limit user appeal,"" cite ""peopl with knowledg of the matter."" In response, Appl ha reportedli ""begun studi lower-pow cellular data chip for futur smartwatch generations.""Thi all seem veri reasonable, but I believ that it highlight a key weak within Apple' chip team that the iDevic maker will need to remedi at some point down the line.Integr a cellular modem would probabl helpA of today, Appl ha yet to releas a processor with an integr cellular modem. In it iPhon and cellular-cap variant of it iPad products, Appl use standalon applic processor pair with standalon cellular modem sourc fromQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) .Other compani that develop processor for mobil use have 3G and 4G cellular modem technolog in hous and are abl to integr that technolog into the same silicon die as the main applic processor. Thi is gener lead to better power effici and, ultimately, batteri life.For example,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recent announc a chip target at wearabl devic known as the Exyno 7270 that integr a 4G LTE modem on the same die as the processor. Qualcomm, too, offer a chip known as the Snapdragon Wear 2100 that also includ an LTE modem on the same die as the main processor.I suspect that if Appl had the capabl in-hous to integr a cellular modem into a futur smartwatch-ori processor, thi would be veri help for tackl those potenti batteri life issues.Appl may veri well be work on itTher ha been plenti of evid that Appl ha continu to build out team to work on wireless chips. For example, Appl put up a job list on Sept. 21 look for someon to work ""a part of a silicon design group respons for design state-of-the-art wireless"" system on a chip.It' hard to know exactli what thi might be for, but it could veri well be in servic of an in-hous cellular modem effort for integr into a futur Appl Watch processor.Appl will figur it out, one way or anotherAlthough it would appear that Appl is current at a competit disadvantag with respect to the integr of cellular modem insid it Appl Watch-bound processors, it' import to note that Appl is extrem technic compet and spend significantli on research and develop in support of it key product categories.Th Appl Watch appear to be someth that Appl is plan to invest in over the long term, and as a result I expect that one way or anoth it will be abl to figur out how to get cellular connect insid a futur Appl Watch.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone Business: 3 Things Investors Need to Know;10/13/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fundament redefin the concept of the smartphon with it 2007 introduct of the origin iPhone. In the year following, the compani ha led the way in bring significant, even game-chang featur that have help transform the smartphon into arguabl the most import -- and most use -- comput devic categori in today' world.makeArticleAd();Th iPhone, unsurprisingly, is far and away Apple' most import product categori from a busi and financi point of view.Today, I'd like to go over three key fact about Apple' iPhon busi that current and potenti investor in the compani should be keenli awar of.Most of Apple' revenu and profit come from iPhoneIn the company' last fiscal year, the iPhon brought in approxim $155 billion in revenu out of a total of roughli $234 billion. Thi mean that more than 66% of the company' revenu that year came from sale of iPhon .Moreover, Apple' depend on the iPhon ha actual increas over the last coupl of years, jump from 53.4% of revenu in fiscal year 2013 to a whop 66.3% of revenu in fiscal year 2015.Additionally, as the iPhon is wide believ to be a higher-margin product than the company' iPad or Mac lineup, it seem like that the iPhon make up an even larger portion of Apple' oper profit, and therefor net income.It' thi depend on the iPhon that lead mani investors, analysts, and invest comment to focu so much on the perform of thi product categori for Apple. If the iPhon is do well, Apple' financi and share price should do well. If iPhon doe badly, then the company' financi and share price should larg follow suit.Apple' iPhon averag sell price eclips it competitors'On of the reason that Appl ha seen such financi success from the iPhon is that it sell a lot of iPhon at averag sell price (ASPs) that are well abov what it competitor are abl to command. In fiscal year 2015, for example, Appl brought in around $155 billion in revenu from iPhon on unit shipment of about 231 million, impli an ASP of $665.To put thi into perspective, dure the second quarter 2016, Apple' chief rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) report overal mobil revenu of approxim $23 billion. Market research firm IDC estim that Samsung ship approxim 77 million smartphon in that quarter.Even if we assum that all of thi mobil revenu came from smartphones, we'r look at smartphon ASP of approxim $298 -- less than half of Apple's. Note that thi is an upper bound, as Samsung' mobil busi includ revenu from tablet and smartwatch in addit to smartphones, includ low-end smartphones.In term of averag revenu and gross profit per smartphone, Appl is way out in front rel to it competition. Thi is view as both a strength (Appl current ha price power, allow it to captur much of the profit in the smartphon industry), as well as a potenti liabil (Appl is at risk of be undercut on pricing, for example).Apple' iPhon busi is current growth-challengedThrough fiscal year 2015, Apple' iPhon busi alway manag to deliv some level of revenu and unit growth. However, Appl is current expect to report it first-ev annual declin in iPhon unit shipment and revenu in fiscal year 2016, follow the first quarterli declin that were recent reported.Clearly, given that Apple' revenu and profit depend so substanti on iPhon sales, thi ha been a key tenet of the bearish thesi around the company' stock. If the iPhon continu to decline, then Apple' revenu and profit are set to suffer, particularli as it will be veri difficult for Apple' other busi -- larg in their own right, but in aggreg still much smaller than iPhon -- to pick up the slack.However, if the iPhon 7 help return the iPhon categori to growth in the come fiscal year, then the compani could be look atcoupl of good year of iPhon growth, particularli as Appl is expect to make some dramat chang with next year' iPhon that could further fuel demand growth.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Even with the recent outperformance, Appl still trade at a price-to-earn ratio of 13.5, approxim half the valuat of the greater S&P 500' P/E ratio of 25.makeArticleAd();In the last month, Apple' return have been turbocharg due toSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) struggles. In September, Samsung issu a voluntari recal for 2.5 million Galaxi Note 7 smartphon due to a ""minor flaw in the batteri manufactur process"" that led to phone exploding. Samsung' situat took a turn for the wors when the compani recent announc it would ceas Galaxi Note 7 product after replac unit prove no safer than the initi models.Convent wisdom state ani loss for Samsung is Apple' gain, and that' most-lik true in some aspect. In the end, however, the biggest beneficiari of Samsung' struggl may be the compani that provid Samsung' ecosystem:Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .Ecosystem is import as devic and switch cost are increasingA base analysi of smartphon typic compar on-devic featur and specifications. While thing like process clock speed, camera megapixels, and design are important, in mani case the differ between premium smartphon are so minuscul they'r unlik to drive the buy decis on their own.What doe drive the buy decis is the abil to quickli access photos, emails, and purchas content and to understand the devic layout. The simpl truth is the ecosystem -- the seamless experi between hardware, oper system, and content -- is becom the true differenti between smartphon more so than devic specifications. And when it come to ecosystem, the oper system is the key differentiator.Whil both Appl and Android-pow phone have taken step to encourag cross-O switchers, it' increasingli difficult for an Android user to becom an iO user, and vice versa, due to the increas switch cost from cloud storage, purchas content (music, movies, and TV shows), and other OS-specif applications. Ecosystem have becom so key to the buy decis that mani smartphon user refer to themselv as ""iOS-only"" or ""Android-only."" Against that backdrop, it' like Samsung' stumbl benefit other high-end Android smartphon vendors.Alphabet' new Googl Pixel smartphone. Imag Source: AlphabetSamsung' Note 7 disast is good news for AlphabetSamsung' stumbl could not have occur at a better time for Alphabet. The company' recent announc Googl Pixel smartphon is a major step in Apple' direction.

Still, with a 30% jump in valu year to date, HP is ride high. What wa the impetu for Monday' stellar run?It appear that some of the analyst who'v been on the HP fenc or were bearish due to the ""di PC market"" have final decid that the rampant gloom and doom wa overblown. The good news is that there are multipl reason for pundit and investor to like what HP CEO Dion Weisler and team are accomplishing.Ther is a caveat to the recent good tidings, however. Wall Street' recent upgrad of HP stock are still overli conservative, which should be music to the ear of growth and incom investors.makeArticleAd();Imag source: HP.Earn respectHP analyst chime in with either upgrades, rais price targets, and/or reiter posit recommend on Monday, and it' about time. As HP demonstr last quarter, and is expect to do again thi quarter, it' hit on most cylind and even an area of concern for some -- total sale -- ha been more than made up for by strength in other areas.Yes, HP' total revenu declin 4% last quarter to $11.9 billion, but it obliter the bearish analyst expect of just $11.44 billion, as did earn per share of $0.48 compar to the $0.44 pundit had forecast. But HP' slight revenu hiccup wa easi to overlook when investor dig a bit deeper, particularli margins, expenses, and non-GAAP (exclud one-tim items) net earn from operations.Thank in larg part to HP shave $600 million in expens year over year, it net earn from continu oper actual climb 20% befor tax to $843 million last quarter, befor it took a hit for ""discontinu operations."" Weisler' strict expens manag effort are also boost margin across the board.HP' person system divis report margin of 4.4% la quarter, up from just 2.8% a year-ago and nearli a full percentag point higher than the previou quarter. Printing, HP' Achilles' heel -- though it issu are be address -- grew margin to a sky-high 20.4%, well abov last year' 17.4%.Still underappreciatedThough HP ha earn a nod from industri analyst of late, their target price don't reflect quit as much confid as Oct. 10' posit stock price movement might indicate. Most of the target are around the $16-a-shar range, which HP stock is nearli at already. If print is the concern, which it veri well could be given it woeful perform last quarter, that shouldn't dissuad investor becaus HP ha a plan.Last quarter' $4.42 billion in printer sale wa a 14% drop compar to 2015' $5.16 billion. Much of the revenu declin can be attribut to HP' suppli segment. HP fan have like heard about it recent $1.05 billion deal to acquireSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) print and copier business, which includ some assist for HP' print suppli woe as well.Bring Samsung' print busi in-hous will not onli ramp up sale thank to it cutting-edg printer-copi lineup util multifunct printer (MFP) technology, the deal also includ the Korea-bas giant' suppli busi and a portfolio of more than 6,500 patents. Weisler' strategi of target specif nich markets, just as with HP' surprisingli strong PC division, will also play a key role in turn around it print results.Th new Sprocket pocket-s printer is the most recent exampl of HP' target approach. At $130, the Sprocket isn't like to make a dramat impact on sale in and of itself. However, it smartphon compat and target of the world' social media and selfi photog is right up HP' strateg alley. And with an expect 2.5 trillion pictur snap thi year, those inexpens Sprocket will requir a lot of supplies.PC are soar -- HP top the U.S. sale list last quarter. HP also boast a stellar 3.2% dividend yield, is run a leaner, meaner operation, and print is be addressed. A price target of $16, even with an analyst' ""buy"" recommendation?

Not all incid stem from a design problem are publicli reported. It is safe to say, however, that there were more incid than the dozen or so that have been confirmed, and that wa more than enough to prompt Samsung to halt sale of the Galaxi Note 7 until it can figur out exactli what' caus the batteri in the devic to overheat, and what to do next.Not Just a Batteri ProblemIf thi all seem vagu familiar, it may be becaus the problem actual surfac in late August. By earli September,al Galaxi Note 7 smartphon were be recal by Samsunga mere month after it had been released, as some of the phone had caught fire while charging.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for the Rest of 2016At the time, it wa believ to be the batteri use rather than the devic itself, and although a simpl swap-out of the batteri would have sufficed, the compani offer an outright exchang for a differ devic if a custom wish it. As it turn out, the problem doesn't appear to be faulti batteries; it' the devic itself.Thi past weekend,sever of the Galaxi Note 7 phone with a replac batteri overh and caught firejust as the previou one had.With the design of the devic clearli flawed, Samsung ha opt to discontinu sale of the device, and to stop make the Galaxi Note 7 altogether.Apple, Alphabet Win at Samsung' ExpenseTh overh issu ha been limit to the Galaxi Note 7, consid it wa a design/qu problem and not just a batteri issue. But it' not a stretch to say Samsung' reput ha been damaged. That will advers impact sale of other Samsung phones, funnel consum to altern phonemak like the newGoogl Pixel, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)Th real winner here, however, are those who'v patient held onto their stake in Appl stock even though sale of the company' flagship smartphone. Apple' iPhon 7 is the onli devic that effect contend with the Galaxi Note 7, and Samsung' devic wa just disqualifi from competing.Thi couldn't have come at a better time for Apple, either. Although the hoopla surround the iPhon 7 wa as loud as it usual is for the releas of other iter of the iPhone,cred report of weak iPhon 7 saleshav spook Appl stock holders. Now Apple' phone won't have to compet with it biggest threat.Th upsid to Appl isn't exactli clear, but Standard & Poor' analyst Angelo Zino think the Samsung debacl could translat into an addit 14 million to 15 million iPhon sold thi quarter. The pro had been expect sale of 60 million unit of the device.It' not just a hollow assumpt or hope logic. A recent poll perform by CNET found that48.5% of the site' reader would opt for the iPhoneif they had to replac their current Galaxi Note 7.Bottom Line for Appl StockI'v made a point in the past about thedang of put Appl stock on a pedestal. But I'v never deni Appl make the highest-qu product found in the consumer-tech market.Up until now it didn't matter. Samsung' and Google' hardwar qualiti wa ""good enough"" to compar it to the function of Apple' devices. The Galaxi Note 7' problem weren't root in a logic-ori design decis though.

Samsung's Nightmare May Not Be Apple's Dream Come True;10/11/2016;"Imag source: Samsung.It look like it' the end of the line forSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) ill-fat Galaxi Note7.

Samsung is now ask wireless carrier and retail partner to ceas sale and exchanges, open the door for rival handset makers.makeArticleAd();Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is be play up as a huge beneficiari here. The stock is shoot higher, and a coupl of Wall Street pro see the class act of Cupertino score million of increment iPhon sale in light of the calam at Samsung.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White feel that Appl stand to score at least 8 million more iPhon unit thi quarter. That would be more than half of the 10 million to 14 million Galaxi Note7 handset that White wa expect Samsung to ship thi year, though Credit Suiss feel that thi will cost Samsung to miss out on 19 million units.S&P analyst Angelo Zino is even more aggressive. He see Appl pick up 14 million to 15 million iPhon sale as a result of the Note7 fiasco. Thi would translat into Android relinquish 1% of the market share to Apple' proprietari iOS, base on the roughli 1.5 billion smartphon that industri tracker expect to ship thi year.Anoth bite of the AppleTh obvious bode well for Appl in thi scenario, and the stock ha been shoot higher as Samsung stock take a hit.Appl stockhit a 10-month high today on the news. However, it' also import to have realist expect here. Appl is go to benefit from the blaze death of the Galaxi Note7, but let' not get too ahead of ourselv here.Samsung is go to have a hard time get back on track. Thi is just one of the mani devic in it wide product line, but the Samsung and Galaxi brand are go to get tarnished. That' clearli good for Apple, but it' probabl even better for mani other maker of Android devices.Android remain the mobil oper system of choice, command 87.6% of the market dure the second quarter accord to industri research IDC. It' far easier and cheaper to replac an Android devic with a rival Android smartphone. If someon deliber chose Android over iO in singl out the Note7, it' a fair bet that those reason are still in play.W also get to the unfortun time of the event. Appl just roll out the iPhon 7 last month, but there' an inventori shortag of the larger iPhon 7 Plu models. That' go to be a problem. Buyer of the Galaxi Note7 were like drawn to the 5.7-inch display. Thi would make the iPhon 7 Plu and it 5.5-inch display a clearer replac choic than the iPhon 7 with it 4.7-inch display.Unfortun for Appl and iPhon 7 Plu seekers, new order for Apple' largest (and priciest) smartphon won't be fill for anoth three to four weeks. If you own a Note7, are you realli go to risk a fire or go without a smartphon for nearli a month? If you bought the gargantuan-s Note7, you will probabl move to a bigger Android devic befor opt for the rel puni iPhon 7.Appl is go to make out like a bandit here, but it may not be as big a winner as bull and some Wall Street pro expect it to be.

Finance.Thi data provid onli a superfici snapshot of these Appl suppliers, so let' investig the invest thesi drive each of these name today.Imag source: Broadcom.Broadcom: Apple' diversifi chip vendorIt' hard to look at the newli combin Broadcom and not love what you see. Today' compani is the result of last year' megamerg between semiconductor giant Broadcom andAvago. An activ pick in at least one of the Fool' premium services, the new, post-merg Broadcom ha emerg stronger and better posit to thrive in our increasingli mobil and connect world.Appl contribut over 10% of Broadcom' sale -- befor the merger, 14% of Broadcom' and 10% of Avago' sale came from Apple. But Broadcom is by no mean reliant on it Appl vendor busi to drive it financi results. It diversifi chipset lineup includ radio frequency, wireless combo chips, broadband, and storag and network chips, each cater to long-term secular growth market in tech. That' whi analyst expect Broadcom' sale to increas 91% thi year and 22.8% next year. (The number is especi big thi year becaus of the merger.) From a longer-term view, the compani is expect to grow it EP at an averag annual rate of 14.5% over the next five years, make it one of the most appeal Appl supplier to own for the near future.Imag source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Co., Ltd.Taiwan Semiconductor: the A10' sole chip supplierIt' been a great time to be a Taiwan Semiconductor shareholder. The compani now serv as Apple' exclus fabric partner for the powerhous A10 chip in the iPhon 7, and the chip fabric house' share have surg in reaction to the news.TSMdata byYChartsTh reaction is understandable. As my Foolish colleagu Ashraf Eassanotes, not onli doe TSM figur to see revenu rise by virtu of win a greater percentag of Apple' business, but it should also enjoy an addit revenu tailwind by virtu of the A10' larger silicon footprint. What' more, TSM ha also reportedli won the fabric contract for the A11 chip that will power next year' reportedli radic redesign 10th-anniversari iPhone. These develop should give TSM a continu boost to sales, though an increas relianc on Appl deserv some caution as well.However, although Appl want to keep it chip foundri busi out the hand of rivalSamsung, it' also shown a willing to reward it South Korean frenemi with it chip-vendor deal if it believ Samsung can produc better result than TSM. Case in point: After TSM produc the major of A8 chips, Appl reportedli contract with it for onli an estim 30% of it A9 chips.Report say that Appl compris onli 8.2% of TSM' sale as of last year, so that number figur to increas dramat as a result of win all of Apple' A10 business. Not that TSM can rest on it laurels, especi with mention ofIntel' interest in further scale out it own third-parti chip foundri services. An Apple-Intel allianc ha alreadi been mention as a distinct possibl in either 2018 or 2019, though they remain just rumor for now.Appl ha a deserv reput as a tough custom for it suppliers. Just ask the now-defunct GT Advanced. The billion in sale Appl can offer a potenti vendor have histor come with their own costs, and anyon look to invest in the compani within Apple' massiv suppli chain need to understand the risks. So while invest in Appl supplier can be a win strategy, as it ha been for Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, it isn't a one-size-fits-al strategy, either.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Google Re-enters China Through The Back Door;10/11/2016;"ByPet Fuhrman:Th end is in sight for Google' (GOOG) (GOOGL) seven wilder year in China. With none of the theatric that accompani it voluntari withdraw from the countri due to web-search censorship in Januari 2010, Googl is now firmli on a path not onli to return to China but also to potenti seiz a spot alongsid Appl (AAPL) as one of the most profit tech compani there.Thi is a like outcom of Google' announc last week that it is enter with full forc the global consum hardwar industry. Googl Pixel mobil phones, Googl Home artifici intelligence-en speakers, Googl Daydream View virtual realiti headset - these will be the engin of Google' reviv in China. Base on what Googl ha so far reveal - includ price - these product may find a larg market among Chines consumers.Th compani ha made no specif mention of plan to re-ent China. China' govern will not like strew the ground with rose petal to welcom Googl back.makeArticleAd();Instead, Googl can reli on China' enorm grey market for electron hardwar to bring it product into China' on-and-offlin retail network. Hong Kong is usual the main transship point, not onli becaus price are lower than in the PRC, but the qualiti of hardwar sold there is consid to be higher.Ther is a preced here. Appl took six year after the iPhone' launch to ramp up it offici sale channel in China by do a deal with the main carrier, China Mobil (CHL). By that point, an estim 30m to 50m grey market iPhon were alreadi in use in China.Mobil phone run Google' Android system alreadi domin the Chines market, with about 300m sold thi year. Most are sold unlock without carrier subsidy. None can freeli access Googl search, storag or maps. The Googl Pixel will like have similar limitations.But Pixel will have huge advantag no other Android phone can match of close integr the oper system and devic hardwar to optim the perform of everyth els on the phone.Al of China' mani Android brand will be impacted, but none more so than the current market leader, Huawei. It now domin the high-end Android market in China, even more so with Samsung' (SSNLF) recent woes. The Pixel will be price to compet directli with Huawei' flagship models.It is not onli in it home market of China that Huawei may get battered. It ha also set great store on becom the world' lead Android phone brand in Europe. That will certainli be far harder to achiev now.A it happens, Google' announc came at a time when just about everyon at Huawei, along with everyon els in China, wa enjoy a week-long nation holiday. They return to their desk thi week to find the tech world disrupted. No one quit predict Googl would amp up it hardwar strategi to thi level.Googl had toy around before, sell small volum of it outsourc Nexus-brand mobil phone to showcas more of Android' features. Huawei wa one of the compani make Nexu phones. Googl also bought Motorola' mobil phone busi in 2011 and unload it two and a half year later to China' Lenovo (LNVGF) (LNVGY), a deal that ha not work out at all well for the Chines company.But thi time, Googl say it is not dabbling. It defin it futur strategi as becoming, like Apple, a fulli vertically-integr hardwar and softwar business, but one with the world' most power system of proprietari voic and text-en artifici intelligence.Googl introduc three hardwar product last week. More are certain to follow, includ perhap a mid-pric phone that will take aim squar at China' Xiaomi (XI) (among others), alreadi reel from fall sale and an inabl to crack the more lucr higher-end Android market.Google' advantag run so deep they can seem unfair. Not onli doe it own and develop the Android softwar it competitor except Appl reli on, it also alreadi ha one of the world' best and most recogniz brands. Also worth noting, Googl now ha about $70bn in cash, mainli sit outsid the US, look for new market to conquer.A for the other new Googl hardwar product - the home speaker and virtual realiti ((VR)) headset - the market seem ripe for the taking. Despit billion of govern dollar invest into Chines compani work on machine-learning, artifici intellig and VR, none ha come to market in ani signific way.Even if they now do, none can match Google' enorm breadth, capabl and experi in human-machin dialogue.Though a success in the US, Amazon' (AMZN) Echo home speaker, which is capabl of interact with the human voice, is a non-ent in China. It doe not understand spoken Chinese. Google, on the other hand, is quit adept at Chinese. While Googl Maps, Gmail, Drive are all block in China, Googl Translat is not.Indeed, the Chines govern quietli stop block it about a year ago. It' the onli one of Google' major onlin offer that can be readili access in China. The reason: Googl Translat ha becom an essenti tool for Chines compani activ internationally, as well as for mani of the 150m middl class Chines now vacat abroad each year.If Sundar Pichai, Google' CEO, is correct, the world includ China is move from a ""mobile-first to an AI-first world."" Googl is alreadi mile farther down thi path than ani Chines company. It need not reestablish it search engin busi in China to be a major forc there.A for China' government, howev it choos to react to Googl hardwar product sweep into China, it own aspir to nurtur globally-competit indigen tech compani probabl just got a lot harder to achieve.In the seven year sinc Googl departed, China becam in mani area even more of a tech Galapagos. Pois now to reenter China by the back door, Googl should like the way the competit landscap look there.If Googl take just 1 percent of the China Android market - and my predict is it will do markedli better - it will have $2bn of annual revenu in China, a busi larger, more valuabl and unassail than when it pull out.Pet Fuhrman is Chairman & CEO of China First Capital, a boutiqu invest bankA publish in the Financi TimesDownload PDF versionSe alsoAmerican Express: Re-Rat Ha Begun And Will Drive The Stock To The $90son seekingalpha.com"

Why the iPhone 7 Is the Best Phone Nobody Needs;10/5/2016;"iPhon 7 Plus, iPhon 7, iPhon 6s Plus, iPhon 6s, iPhon SE. Apple' latest iPhon look a lot like the previou model. Imag source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha set the bar so high with the iPhon that the compani ha troubl top itself.makeArticleAd();In fact, sinc it ad Siri in the iPhon 4s in 2011, you could argu that the compani ha not made ani truli revolutionari changes. You could also argu that Appl Pay, which wa first releas in 2014 with the iPhon 6, meet that threshold, but certainli noth on the 6s or 7 model does.It' not that these are not fabul phones. Everi singl iPhon improv upon the last with a faster processor along with other improvements. The 7 and 7 Plu model have better cameras, doubl the storag space on the entry-level model from the previou standard, margin better batteri life, and a slightli improv look.Th problem is that for most consum these chang are like ad five mile per hour to the top speed of a Ferrari. It sound nice, and it count as be better, but veri few peopl will ever take advantag of the improvements.iPhon 7 and 7 Plu may be the best phone ever created, but for the most part, the improv over the 6s and 6s Plu they replac won't be notic by most users. The previous-gener phone were so good that noth short of ad revolutionari new function should make upgrad worth it.That' not a problem uniqu to Apple.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) face it, too, when it releas new version of it Galaxi Phone. Better ha becom ho-hum and even bad phone are so good that it ha becom veri hard to impress people.Hands-on with the iPhon 7 PlusA an avid iPhon user who cover the technolog space, I consid upgrad my phone each year for work. And while I wa happi when my order of the iPhon 7 in the new black color arrived, actual use it wa a bit underwhelming.Physically, asid from the chang in color from my previou phone' space grey, the two unit look and feel nearli the same. The new home button and the simul click work well -- perhap even a littl better than the old one. In addition, Forc Touch, which I found complet useless on my previou phone, now work better, make it now just mostli useless.Th improv processor and camera may well be as revolutionari as Appl say they are, but after a week or so of use (and dozen of pictur of my cats), it' hard to notic that anyth ha changed. Batteri life is anecdot better as on my last iPhone, a full workday of email, pictures, and playingPokemon Gooften left me sub-20% by 5 p.m. Now, after similar usage, I end up closer to 40%, but it' also worth note that my past experi ha shown that batteri tend to perform better when a phone is new.And while I like the new iPhon becaus it ha doubl the storag of the previou model -- 32GB versu 16GB for the iPhon 6s Plu -- I'm actual more annoy by the lack of a headphon jack than I expect to be. It' not that the includ Lightn headphon don't work and it wa nice of Appl to includ a dongle/adapt so peopl can use old ones, but there are unexpect issues.Th problem is that I almost never use headphones, but I do plug into my car stereo use the aux port in my vehicl and the headset jack on the iPhone. I can still do that via the dongle, but it' mildli annoy to have to carri the adapt with me or buy a second one to leav in the car.Appl ha itself to beatTh problem for Appl (and to a lesser extent, Samsung) is that it phone are so great that even an iPhon 5 doe more than most peopl need. Thi ha not been a huge drag on Apple, but iPhon replac cycl are lengthening, accord toresearchfrom Consum Intellig Research Partner (CIRP), which said:In the year end with the June 2013 quarter, 66% of old iPhon were either under one year old or from 1-2 year old. By the March 2016 quarter, 51% of old iPhon were either under one year old or from 1-2 year old.

What realli hurt is that befor taxes, print gener the major of HP' earn from continu operations. Needless to say, CEO Dion Weisler and team have some work to do, but a few of HP' recent move could be just what the doctor ordered.Phas one of the planHP' save grace last quarter were strong PC sales.

If NXP Semiconductors NV Is for Sale, Which Company Going to Buy It?;10/5/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.Rumor ha it thatNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) is look for a buyer. Lean on nameless insid sources,Bloombergsaid thatQUALCOMM(NASDAQ: QCOM) is in ""preliminari talks"" with the company, and that NXP is shop around for a better offer. NXP share have soar more than 25% higher sinc the Bloomberg report wa post last Thursday.makeArticleAd();It' a juici rumor, but doe it make ani sense?

Finance.Aft combin with fellow embed chip specialist Freescal Semiconductor, NXP now rank among the 10 largest compani in the industri -- but still remain a rel minnow next to these even larger titans. Thi in-between market situat put NXP in a tricki position. The compani is larg enough to move the needl significantly, even for Intel and Samsung, but too larg to be an easi pickup for ani of these peers.It' true that most of these suitor have access to more capit than you see in the typic present of cash equivalents. For example, Intel and Qualcomm could liquid nearli $14 billion of long-term invest in a pinch. But that' a last resort, and a veri unlik method of fund a major buyout.A for Samsung, the semiconductor arm of thi multi-industri colossu can't lay claim to the entir cash hoard. The Korean compani deriv just 24% of it revenu and 32% of oper profit from it semiconductor division.Th onli realist way to structur NXP' combin with ani of these rival would includ addit debt and a fair amount of stock-swapping. The compani is simpli too larg for a pure cash-bas deal, and none of the suggest partner would make thi move on a whim.So, which compani is most like the winner?Read the tea leaves, Qualcomm certainli look like the most deepli interest partner here. The compani is look to diversifi beyond the mobil commun sector that ha treat it so well over the last decad but is now run out of steam. NXP offer a brand new slate of target market that includesautomot computingand digit secur tools. Both of these would fit like a hand in Qualcomm' glove, without step on ani of the buyer' toe in overlap markets.Furthermore, Qualcomm feel the itch from a larg and inact cash pile, and could put it to good use here. The pristin balanc sheet would instantli turn toxic, but current and futur cash flow should straighten out that problem in a coupl of years. And don't forget that Qualcomm' share are trade near their 52-week highs, make the stock an effect tool for cash-plus-shar takeov deals.And there' even more evid of a pend Qualcomm bid. Accord to Bloomberg, NXP hire Frank Quattrone' Qatalyst Partner to look around for seriou bidders. As it happens, Qatalyst ha a histori of make big sale to Qualcomm. Thi wa the firm thatturn Wi-Fi chip specialist Athero Commun into a Qualcomm division, with a gener $3.5 billion price tag.Now, I'm not say that Qualcomm absolut must, will, or even should buy NXP.Fellow Fool Leo Sun alreadi explor that question.

In the last quarter, it wa $4.88 billion on sale of 9.95 million units. That' just over 10% of the company' total revenu for Q3 2016.However, that number ha been slide for three years. In Q3 2013, iPad sale number 14.6 billion. Thi isn't an Apple-specif issue.Tablet sale worldwid declin 12.3% in Q2 2016, and AAPL actual did better than mani competitors.10 Biotech Stock to Put on Your Radar Thi QuarterHowever, iPad sale are a more import revenu gener for Apple, than they are for, say,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), who doesn't even bother to releas number for it Kindl Fire tablets.iPad Pro to the Rescue?In the latest quarter, the averag new iPad sale for Appl wa roughli $490. But in Q3 2013, when the sale number were much higher, the averag price per unit work out to about $436.That differ in averag sell price can be attribut to the iPad Pro.Sinc Appl first releas the iPad in 2010, the base price of the latest new iPad had been $499. The except wa the releas of the iPad Mini in 2012 for $329. But in 2015, AAPL shook thing up with a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro at $799.The bigger move (no pun intended) wa 2016' 9.7-inch iPad Pro at $599. Thi time, Appl decid to sit out updat the age iPad Air 2, so rather than a new iPad at $499 thi year, the latest new iPad wa $599.AAPL to Go All-In on iPad Pro in 2017Appl ha been expect to ditch the iPad Mini sooner rather than later. It wa introduc to fight off cheap, 7-inch Android tablet introduc by Amazon,Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and others. With the popular of the 5.5-inch iPhon Plu - seen as cannib it sale - the iPad Mini' day seem numbered.However,Mac Otakara(a blog which wa first to predict the iPhon 7 would ditch the headphon jack, gain a new Home button and be offer in two black color options) is predictingAAPL will releas three new iPad Pro modelsnext spring.Accord toMac Otakara, the 12.7-inch iPad Pro will be back, as expected. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro will grow slightli to 10.1-inches. And, the iPad Mini will becom a new 7.9-inch iPad Pro, complet with Smart Connector, 4-speaker audio and True Tone display.Increas the size of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 10.1-inch is a rel small tweak, but make it more friendli to busi user and is a symbol break from the past. The origin iPad wa 9.7-inches, a size Appl alway maintain wa optimal. But AAPL is now chase profession that want a larger display for text and numbers, not consumers…And by not jettison the iPad Mini altogether, but instead make it an ultraport iPad Pro, AAPL can consolid all it new iPad under the ""Pro"" umbrella. Ultimately, that simplifi the product line-up.I Twitter Inc a Poison Chalice? (TWTR)It also leav one tablet that' current and afford for consumers, in the 7.9-inch iPad Pro. And, it jack up the averag sell price for an iPad - despit consum resist to pay more - boost revenue.If Appl could actual sellmoreiPad instead of less, combin with that increas sell price per unit, the tablet busi could continu to be one of AAPL' revenu pillars. And while that scenario seem unlik base on the past three years, at least some peopl thinkiPad sale are near to reach bottomand due for a rebound.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace6 Bank Stock That Can Come BackTh 10 Best Stock to Buy for the Rest of 2016The postAppl Inc.

Apple'sAAPLiPhon is the most popular phone on the market, and iter of the product have been close critiqu and examin after each release.Th iPhon 7 ha some neat new featur like water resist and stereo sound, but it is no stranger to scrutiny. Mani have been complain about the latest iPhonelack a headphon jack and physic home button, but there now seem to be someth els folk can complain about.Two test conduct byWhich?hav reveal that the iPhon 7' batteri life doesn't last as long as it 3 major competitors' smart phones, which includ the SamsungSSNLFGalaxi S7, the HTC 10, and the LG G5. One of the test measur how long the phone would last make calls, and the other measur batteri life when brows the web.

The HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxi S7 last about 31, 26.3, and 24.9 hour respectively. The iPhon 7 perform much worse, log in just 11.9 hour of call time on a full charge.

Analyst were expect a loss of 5 cent per share of BBRi stock thi time around, on $394 million in revenue.makeArticleAd();CEO John Chen commented, ""We are reach an inflect point with our strategy. Our financi foundat is strong, and our pivot to softwar is take hold.""To that end, BlackBerry' softwar and servic revenu grew 111% on a year-over-year basis, reach approxim $155 million, or 44% of the company' total revenue.But that growth is come at the expens of other segments.Th 10 Best Blue-Chip Dividend Stock to Buy for Q4Servic access fee account for 26% of last quarter' revenue, or $91 million, while mobil solut (devices) made up 30% of fiscal Q2' sales.

Better Buy: Sierra Wireless vs. InvenSense;9/28/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.BothInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) andSierra Wireless(NASDAQ: SWIR) have taken a beat over the past year, with their stock price down 20% and 33%, respectively. But both compani still have lot of potenti in their respect markets.makeArticleAd();Let' look at the problem face both compani and what they'r do to fix them, and decid which compani might be the better buy for investors.SWIR,INVNdata byYCharts.Th case for Sierra WirelessSierra Wireless' stock hasn't exactli been an easi one to watch. In the second quarter of thi year the compani beat Wall Street' estimates, but post a quarterli declin of 1.1%. That' not all that great, of course, and revenu for the company' OEM solut unit (it main revenu driver) fell by 4% year over year.Part of the declin from OEM wa from invest in new custom that should pay off down the road. Manag said on the second-quart earn call that two new design win in the China OEM market, along with new win in transportation, smart metering, network and industri segments, will help long-term growth. But the compani also ad that OEM revenu may still be weak in the short term.Additionally, Sierra Wireless increas revenu from it second-biggest busi segment, Enterpris Solutions, by 10% year over year. Part of thi growth came from sale of two new products, the RV50 industri gateway router and the MP70 rug mobil router. The compani also said new product are launch in the second half of thi year that should continu to grow enterpris revenue.Anoth bright spot for Sierra Wireless come from it recent purchas of GenX Mobile. The compani believ the purchas will not onli help it scale some of it enterpris products, but could also lead to more sale in the company' cloud and connect segment by bundl GenX Mobil devic with cloud services.And despit it overal revenu losses, Sierra Wireless continu to hold onto it domin posit in revenu market share (current 33%) of the embed machine-to-machin (M2M) modul business.Th case for InvenSenseInvenSense' stori is one full of possibilities, but also not without it pitfalls. The compani is best known for make motion sensor (gyroscop and accelerometers) for the mobil market, and boast bothApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsunga customers.That wa all well and good when both smartphon maker were see sky-high devic sales, but the overal smartphon market ha cool as of late.Smartphon shipment were flat in the first quarter of thi year, rise just 0.2% year over year compar to growth of 16.7% in the first quarter of 2015. Accord to IDC, first-quart 2016 growth wa the smallest year-over-year smartphon growth on record, and it' not expect to get much better. IDC expect growth todropto just 0.2% between 2015 and 2020 in develop smartphon markets.InvenSens receiv 46% of it total revenu from Apple, and with iPhon sale see consecut year-over-year declin (16.3% in Q2 2016 and 15% in Q3) that depend ha hurt InvenSense. In fiscal Q1 2017, InvenSense' revenu came in at $60.6 million, repres a 43% drop year over year.Th compani know better than anyon that it can't continu to reli on Appl for such a larg chunk of it revenue. That' whi InvenSens is diversifi some of it revenu away from it mobil segment. A year ago, InvenSens brought in 72% of total revenu from compon sale from it mobil segment, but that' sinc fallen to 63%. Meanwhile, it ""Internet of Thing and other"" segment ha grown from 12% to 25% of total revenue.Sel compon to other market outsid of mobil will be the key to the company' futur stability. Smartphon sale could bounc back, of course, and if Appl pull off blockbust sale of it new iPhones, then InvenSens should definit benefit. But diversifi it custom portfolio is certainli on the top of InvenSense' to-do list.Th verdictI think Sierra Wireless' domin M2M embed modul posit and it growth from it enterpris and cloud servic segment -- along with new custom growth in it OEM busi -- are put that compani in a veri strong position.Between Sierra and InvenSense, Sierra' busi appear to be much more stable. It revenu are grow faster than InvenSense's, and the compani ha no custom that account for as larg a percentag of revenu as Appl doe at InvenSense. For now, Sierra get my pick.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Intel Corporation Likely to Maintain Process Density Leadership at 10 Nanometers;9/27/2016;"Microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) ha long been known for it chip-manufactur prowess rel to competitors. It manufactur technolog have often offer better perform than the competition, and it ha usual been abl to bring denser technolog -- that is, technolog that allow chip design to pack more function into a given area -- to the market sooner than it competitors.However, in recent years, Intel' chip manufactur peersTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been work to tri to narrow the gap.Dur the next coupl of years, Intel is certainli go to face someth of a public relations/percept nightmar as it chip-manufactur peer transit to technolog that they refer to as ""7-nanometer"" -- usual smaller is better -- around the time when Intel will be in product on a technolog that it call ""10-nanometer."" Although there' more to a chip-manufactur technolog than density, it' a relev metric that ha a direct impact on the capabl that these compani can, cost-effectively, put into their chip designs.makeArticleAd();A question that' worth pondering, then, is the following: Will Intel be abl to maintain chip-area leadership with it 10-nanomet technolog even as competitor transit to their ""7-nanometer"" technologies? I think the answer to that is ""yes."" Here' why.Compar TSMC' public statement with Intel'sI consid TSMC to be Intel' fiercest and most capabl competitor. It' the world' most success contract chip manufacturer, and over the last sever generations, it ha execut brilliantli in ramp new manufactur technolog into product in support ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) A-seri processors.In contrast, Samsung ha lost Apple' business, and is even reportedli activelyshift focu awayfrom contract chip manufactur in favor of display manufacturing. In light of this, I think the most interest discuss is one in which we look at Intel' and TSMC' public statement head-to-head.A metric that Intel use (publicly) to compar the rel densiti of two manufactur technolog is gate pitch multipli by cell height. (A visual represent can be found below.)Imag source: Intel.Intel say that, use thi metric, it 10-nanomet technolog offer ""close to a full gener lead in logic density,"" as illustr in the slide below:Imag source: Intel.Intel also claim that it 10-nanomet technolog provid better than it histor 0.46 time scale factor rel to it 14-nanomet technology, though the chipmak doesn't specifi by how much.In the tabl below, I show the gate pitch multipli by minimum metal pitch -- a similar metric that Intel and other have use in the past in place of gate pitch multipli by cell height -- for sever Intel and TSMC technologies, as well as my projections. Thi is base on Intel' and TSMC' public statement for what futur technolog will bring:IntelTSMC14nm/16nm3640576010nm<1674~28807nmN/A~1766Data sources: Intel and TSMC.At the 14/16-nanomet generation, Intel had a clear lead over TSMC in term of density. TSMC say (viaEETimes) that it will go into mass product on it 10-nanomet technolog by the end of the year, and that it will provid a 50% area reduct compar to it 16-nanomet technology. TSMC' 10-nanomet technolog should be superior to Intel' 14-nanomet technolog in term of chip area, and it should be in mass product befor Intel' 10-nanomet technology.At 10 nanometers, Intel should see a scale factor of someth smaller than 0.46 times, per it own statements, result in the <1674 figur given in the tabl above. Accord to EETimes, TSMC claim that it 7-nanomet technolog will offer a 1.63 time the densiti of it 10-nanomet technolog -- an impli scale factor of ~0.613 times.Intel should have a slight area leadBas on the analysi above, Intel' 10-nanomet technolog should have aslightarea lead over TSMC' 7-nanomet technology. What thi mean is that Intel' market claim that it' almost a gener ahead of TSMC are virtual worthless becaus TSMC' 10-nanomet technolog should be in mass product befor Intel's.In fact, in term of timeline, TSMC' 7-nanomet technolog is expect to go into mass product in the first quarter of 2018 -- approxim two quarter after Intel begin mass product of it 10-nanomet technology. (Intel' first 10-nanomet chip should go on sale in the fourth quarter of 2017 accord to leaks, impli mass product start in the third quarter of 2017).The realiti is that, in term of chip area scaling, Intel is like to have a roughli six-month lead over TSMC. This, in the scheme of how long these technolog are expect to remain lead edge, is just not all that long.Th good news for Intel is that, contrari to the market label that TSMC (and other contract chip manufacturers) assign to their technologies, it won't actuallyfal behindit competit in term of chip area scaling. The day of Intel have a substanti leadership posit in thi metric, though, are like long gone.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

And there wa consider anger over the decis to ax the headphon jack.But as review got their hand on the new iPhone, the narr began to change.Facebook Overestim a Critic Video Metric for Year (FB)Subtl tweak Appl made to the iPhon 7, like re-rout the antenna band to make it less obvious, ad up. The new Jet Black finish option wa gorgeous. And with theSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxi Note explod batteri crisis, mayb Appl wa right to have kept a proven design rather than to take risk by push the envelope.Th water resist work even better than expected. Thedisplay wa a work of arteven if it wa just LCD. The A10 Fusion CPU wa a perform monster, and the dual-camera optic zoom of the iPhon 7 Plu wa push out some incred imag when given to pro photographers.Add in the boost base storag - 32GB up from 16GB - and the iPhon 7 wa turn into a sleeper hit.Th List of iPhon 7 Issu is Ad UpHowever, in the week sinc actual consum got their hand on the new iPhone, the list of complaint ha been growing. Most are minor issues, but mani are the sort of thing you simpli wouldn't expect from Apple.Among the iPhon 7 issu current be tracked:Extrem and excess scratch of the Jet Black version.New solid state Home button complaint that ""Taptic Engine"" feel unnatural, and the buttondoesn't work with mani touch-en winter glovesand protect cases.Consum Reportsreleasestest result of iPhon 7 camera, say ""So far, we'v found no major leap in camera perform from the iPhon 6s models.""Lightn EarPod remot failingwith the iPhon 7.Report that some iPhon 7 Plu owner are experienc loud hiss nois from their smartphon - also known as ""Hissgate.""And the latest, which start pop up on user forum over the past few days: Some iPhon 7 user are experiencingpoor or distort audio when take voic calls.Yes, peopl do still use smartphon for make calls, so thi is a problem.Did Appl Drop the Ball Despit Play It Safe?Non of these iPhon 7 issu is anywher near the sever of those explod Galaxi Notes.

1 More Surprise Winner Inside the Apple Inc. iPhone 7;9/19/2016;"Imag source: Getty.TheApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu offici hit store shelv on Sept. 16, and it wasn't long beforeChipworkspublish a tear-down report show the chip insid these new smartphones.makeArticleAd();Ther is a lot of neat stuff go on insid Apple' latest smartphones, but the Chipwork tear-down report reveal a new design win that could be interest for a small and rel unknown chipmaker.An FPGA insid the iPhoneAccord to Chipwork the iPhon 7 contain a field programm gate array, or FPGA, from a small FPGA specialist calledLattic Semiconductor(NASDAQ: LSCC) .A good explan of what an FPGA is come from anoth FPGA manufacturer,Xilinx:FPGA can be reprogram to desir applic or function requir after manufacturing. Thi featur distinguish FPGA from Applic Specif Integr Circuit (ASICs), which are custom manufactur for specif design tasks.Chipwork say that it found an FPGA from Lattic carri the model number ""ICE5LP4K.""Bas on the model number of thi chip, it would seem that we are look at the highest-end member of Lattic Semi' iCE40 Ultra famili of FPGAs. Accord to the data sheet for the iCE40 Ultra famili of FPGAs, it is ""an ultra-low-pow FPGA and sensor manag design for ultra-low-pow mobil applic such as smartphones, tablets, and hand-held devices.""Given the programm natur of FPGAs, it' hard to know what exactli what Appl is use thi chip for.Imag Source: Lattic Semiconductor.What could thi mean for Lattice?In an investor present accompani it earn call last month, the compani said that it revenu in the second quarter ""benefit from ramp Tier 1 custom OEM win."" Additionally, it expect ""double-digit revenu growth"" dure the current quarter driven partial by ""ramp Tier 1 Consum OEM wins.""It' clear that at least some of Lattice' confid came from the fact that it would be enter the iPhon 7 suppli chain.Th good news for Lattic is that tear-down of the previous-gener iPhon 6s and 6s Plu didn't show the presenc of a Lattic FPGA. Thi should mean that the iPhon 7 and 7 Plu repres noth but upsid for the programmable-log specialist.It' hardli a given, though, that Lattic will be abl to maintain it spot insid futur iPhones. Perhap Appl is mere use an FPGA as a stopgap solut until it can build a special chip to perform the task that it current use the FPGA for.For example, the the Chipwork tear-down of theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi S5 reveal a Lattic FPGA, but it tear-down of the later Galaxi S7 Edg doesn't show a Lattic chip insideTh good news is that in the here and now, Lattic is pois to benefit from the sale cycl for the iPhon 7 and 7 Plus.Additionally, even if Lattice' chip aren't use in the iPhon 8 (or whatev Appl call it next iPhone), the compani should still gener revenu from sale of the iPhon 7 and 7 Plu when they becom Apple' mid-rang product offer -- though the year-over-year comparison would becom unfavor for Lattice.On the flip side, if Lattice' chip are chosen for the iPhon 8, then the compani should see revenu growth -- at least in the Apple-rel portion of it busi -- from the fact that it chip will be in both Apple' latest smartphon and it mid-rang offering.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Thi can be a headwind for Appl in term of growth opportun in the short term, but it also ha big posit implic for investors.Appl is one of a kindAppl own one of the most valuabl brand in the world, and Appl user are remark loyal to the company. The Fortun Brand Rank consid Appl the most valuabl brand on the planet, with an estim valu of $154.1 billion. Competitor Samsung come in 11th, accord to the publication, the Samsung brand is reportedli worth $36.1 billion.Even better, the competit gap between Appl and Samsung seem to be widen lately, as the iPhon 7 is off to a strong start, while Samsung is face seriou problem with the Galaxi Note 7. The South Korean manufactur ha recal 2.5 million Note 7s after dozen of case in which batteri explod or caught fire. Thi is an import issu in term of custom safety, and it will probabl inflict consider damag to Samsung' reputation.On the other hand, bothT-Mobil US(NASDAQ: TMUS) andSprint Corporation(NYSE: S) announc on Tuesday that demand for the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu look encouragingli strong. Accord to T-Mobile, the iPhon 7 is the biggest pre-ord in T-Mobile' history, and Sprint said pre-ord of the iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu are up more than 375% in the first three day over the same period last year.Appl ha a price disadvantag versu lower-cost competitors, limit market share potenti in emerg market where incom level are lower and the carrier subsidi model is not as extend as in the Unit States. However, when it come to compet in the higher end of the price spectrum, Appl come second to none.Th iPhon versu the iPhoneMost custom don't renew their smartphon everi year.

However, the product is no game-chang in comparison with the iPhon 6 or the iPhon 6s. Sinc mani Appl custom alreadi own an iPhone, we could say that the main challeng for the iPhon 7 is persuad custom to get rid of their older phone and chang them for the latest iPhone. In a sense, the iPhon is it own biggest competitor, and Appl is a victim of it own success.Th bright sideTh fact that previou iPhon model are good enough for mani consum can be a limit when it come to introduc new versions.

Why HP Inc.'s Deal With Samsung Could Be a Game Changer;9/15/2016;"It may come as a surprise, given all the gloom-and-doom talk surround the ""dying"" PC market, butHP(NYSE: HPQ) is more than hold it own. Last quarter wa a great exampl of CEO Dion Weisler and team deliv on their strateg object of target nich market within the struggl PC market, and HP' fiscal third quarter 2016 made it clear the plan is on target.Th same can't be said for HP' other division, printing. If not for a woeful quarter of printing-rel sales, HP would have realli surpris bearish pundit in Q3. Unfortunately, it wa not to be. But a recent move by Weisler to ""disrupt"" a stagnant copier industri and bolster HP' bevi of print solut will be an absolut game changer for year to come.A billion-dollar bargainIn an effort to ""reinvent and replac service-intens copier with superior multifunct printing,"" HP recent ink a $1.05 billion deal with longtim partnerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) for the South Korean conglomerate' printer unit. The acquisit is the largest printing-rel deal in HP' long history.makeArticleAd();Accord to HP, the copier market ""hasn't innov in decades,"" and with an estim $55 billion in global sale avail for the taking, a printer-copi combin util today' technology, includ the cloud and enhanc data security, could turn HP' woeful print unit on it head.Samsung' print unit includ ""a formid portfolio of A3 MFPs"" (multifunct printers) for the tradit print market, some of which have a mere seven replac parts. As for sales, Samsung brought in $1.8 billion in print revenu in fiscal 2015, which is a drop in the bucket compar to HP' $13.7 billion so far in fiscal 2016.However, the deal involv a great deal more than simpli rebrand and sell Samsung products. HP intend to combin it PageWid technolog -- which improv quality, boost efficiency, and reduc user cost -- with Samsung MFP to develop a new gener of printers. And that' just the start.Just as import to the deal are the ancillari asset that come with the $1.05 billion check HP will write sometim in the next 12 months, which is when the acquisit is expect to close. HP will retain nearli 1,300 Samsung engin and research to bolster it own research and develop efforts.And what could prove to be the most valuabl aspect of the deal is the portfolio of ""more than 6,500 print patents"" that will come along with the talent and the products. Samsung ha also agre to invest $100 million to $300 million in HP stock purchas on the open market onc the regulatori hurdl are cleared.Imag source:HP.Wher to from here?HP' $11.9 billion in revenu last quarter wa a 4% declin compar to the year-ago period -- that' the bad news. The good news is that it person system unit -- home of HP' PC-relat sale -- actual improved, albeit slightly, to $7.51 billion from last year' $7.5 billion.Notebooks, in particular, perform admir in Q3, with sale climb 8%, to $4.3 billion -- easili make it the person system team' top revenu driver. HP' focu on nich markets, such as it new OMEN virtual-reality-readi notebook and desktops, drove an increas in PC sale and the segment' share of the overal market in calendar Q2.A for printing, the 14% drop in sale last quarter, to $4.4 billion, wa led by a whop 18% declin in suppli revenue. But along with the Samsung deal, Weisler ha a plan to address that shortcoming. For one, HP will focu on sell high-end enterpris printer to increas suppli sales. And HP' leadership posit in both commerci and consum 3D print will also give it a boost go forward.Accord to one estimate, 3D print will gener $7 billion in revenu thi year, up just $1 billion from 2014. However, two year from now the market is expect to skyrocket to $13 billion, and it is predict to soar to $21 billion by 2020. Print is HP' Achilles' heel today, but the Samsung acquisition, suppli sale strategy, and a burgeon 3D market will make that a thing of the past.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Why Apple Inc. Didn’t Include OLED Displays on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus;9/15/2016;"Imag source: Apple.With thi year' iPhones,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made a number of enhanc to the display -- a critic part of the user experi -- rel to last year' models. The new display support the much wider DCI-P3 color gamut for better color satur and are substanti brighter -- 25% brighter, accord to the iDevic maker. These chang impli that Appl is use an all-new liquid-cryst display (commonli abbrevi LCD) backlight in thi device, as bright and color gamut in an LCD are larg dictat by the backlight.makeArticleAd();To the disappoint of some, Appl did not use an Organ Light Emit Diode, or OLED, display in the new iPhone. OLE have a number of advantag over LCDs, with two obviou one be that they can deliv substanti enhanc contrast rel to LCDs, improv imag quality, and the fact that they can be curv as inSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) recent flagships.Appl is expect to use curv OLE display on it next-gener iPhones, but thi year, Appl stuck to LCDs, know full well that do so could put it at a market disadvantag rel to Samsung and other smartphon makers. And to be blunt, Appl isn't stupid.Th question, then, is ""why?""It look like an issu of technolog readinessIt may seem as though Appl mere buy display and ha veri littl involv with the underli technolog that goe into them. Apple' secreci mean that it doesn't talk about thi sort of thing, but the compani ha hire a substanti number of display technologists. These engin like work close with the major display manufactur to build product that meet Apple' exact specifications.In order for Appl to choos to adopt OLE displays, it need to be sure that the new display will bring with them all of the advantag tradit associ with OLE while at the same time not regress in ani key way rel to the best LCDs. To be blunt, I don't think Appl could have adopt OLE thi year without make signific sacrifices.For example, accord to AnandTech' testing, the display found on the Note7 -- arguabl the best smartphon OLE display in the market today -- onli achiev a maximum bright of 359 nits. The iPhon 6s Plus, which Appl rate at 500 nit of brightness, actual manag to achiev 582 nit in AnandTech' tests.Th iPhon 7 Plus' display, which Appl rate at 625 nit of brightness, could veri well achiev over 700 nit of bright if the delta between Apple' rate and measur bright hold for the iPhon 7/7 Plu as it did with the iPhon 6s/6 Plus, and even iPhon 6/6 Plus.If, with the iPhon 7/7 Plus, Appl is abl to achiev best-in-class color/grayscale/satur accuraci (the key metric that AnandTech tests) combin with an extrem bright display, then I would argu that use a similar panel to the one found on the Note7 or S7/S7 Edg would have been an unaccept regress in a number of key ways.Appl Watch 2 paint a bright pictur for the 2017 iPhoneInterestingly, Appl ha alreadi adopt OLE display in the Appl Watch, and at it Sept. 7 product launch event, talk up the display improv on the second-gener Appl Watch. In particular, the iDevic maker claim that the Appl Watch 2' display is extrem bright and capabl of emit 1000 nit of light. If Appl and it display partner(s) are abl to scale thi technolog up for use on next year' iPhones, then next year' iPhon display could be unequivoc better than thi year's.Impl for Apple' iPhon bizI suspect that mani of Apple' competitor will increasingli shift OLE in a bid to differenti their offer over the come months. Even if those display are inferior to Apple' LCD in a number of key areas, those competitor will like use the ""we have OLE and Appl doesn't"" market angl to tri to maintain/gain share at the high end of the smartphon market.Unfortunately, thi is a market disadvantag that Appl is go to have to live with over the cours of thi product cycle. Fortunately, though, onc Appl transit to OLEDs, it competit won't be abl to use thi against it -- someth that could help acceler ani potenti share gain that the iPhon 7 and 7 Plu manag to deliv for the iDevic maker -- should they help it gain share, at all.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Sinc becom a dividend payer again in 2012 (it wassuspendedfrom 1996-2011), they have increas the quarterli dividend by 50% from 38 cent per share to 57 cents.With a rel low payout ratio, high return on invest capital, and an extrem valuabl consum brand, Appl look undervalu at onli 13x 2016 earnings. Warren Buffet' lieuten certainti agre asBerkshir invest over a billion dollarsin the compani thi year.makeArticleAd();However, in a world where technolog trendschang drastic quickly, should investor count on Appl to deliv sustain dividend growth?Apple' Busi AnalysisAppl is a global technolog compani with a rich histori of product innovation. In fiscal year 2015, they gener sale of roughli $234 billion dollars. To put some context around thi coloss sale number, it islarg than the GDP of mani countries.In general, the technolog industri isa difficult industri to invest in for dividend investorsdu to the speed at which trend can influenc competit positions. The same factor that have allow Appl to be extrem success could just as easili go against the compani if a competitor were to come out with a far superior product or if a new innov were to displac the iPhon entirely.Besid pay attent to all the usualimport financi ratios, dividend investor need to pay attent to the sustain of the current margin structure, project key product growth rates, and Apple' capit allocation.10 Stock to Take Profit On NOWAppl oper the busi through key product line includ the iPhon (66% of sales), iPad (10%), Mac (11% ), Servic (8.5%), and Other Product (4.5%). Appl gener enviabl econom with return on invest capit significantli abov it cost of capit driven by 30%+ oper margins.Source: Simpli Safe DividendsMargin have significantli increas from around 12% in the pre-iPhon year close to a decad ago. In fiscal year 2006, Apple' main sourc of revenu came from the Mac and iPad. Clearli the econom of the busi have chang with the introduct of the iPhone.Source: Simpli Safe DividendsSomereportsput the gross margin on the iPhon 6 at nearli 70%. Thi is a huge margin and obvious help drive up the company-wid margin well into the 30% range.Furthermore, Apple' margin is well in excess of estim Android phone manufactur (HTC,Soni Corp (ADR)(SNE),LG,Samsung Electronic(SSNLF), etc.margin of flat to 10%.The onli reason Appl can gener such a superior econom profil rel to peer ha to be due to brand power, captur the full econom of the phone (softwar and hardware), better term from suppliers, or a superior product. In fact, it is like that they benefit from all of these factors. Given the current busi mix and way the busi ha evolv over the past decade, the sustain of iPhon margin are the key to maintain the robust oper profile.Clearli thi could chang if Appl develop a breakthrough new product or service. After all, few predict back in the early-to-mid-2000 that smartphon adopt would take off like it did and that Appl would be the one to captur the major of the valu from the market.Assum that the busi mix remain the same, the key to the sustain of the current oper profil and futur dividend increas is maintain the iPhon economics.Acurr iPhon 6s cost $100 more(roughli 15% higher price point) than a Galaxi S7 despit the Samsung phone have a better display and camera, more storage, and a host of other features.If peopl were simpli interest in the specif and features, then purchas the iPhon at a higher price point doe not make sense. Instead peopl buy base on brand and user experience. After all, if the averag person is unabl to seamlessli navig all the features, then the featur don't add ani value.Also, the way most iPhon are purchas enabl veri attract pricing. In 2015,76% of US shoppersbought phone through their carrier. Thi mean that there wasn't the upfront $600+ sticker shock of purchas the phone. Instead, the phone cost is built into the monthli cell phone bill. Thi is akin to financ a car rather than pay cash up front.Th most recent data point indic that the price dynam in the market is still healthy. Appl recent releas their new iPhon 7 family, and some version are at a higher price point.Whil growth investor will be pay attent to the latest news on iPhon shipment and product cycles, the number one concern for dividend investor need to be on the current margin structure. For now it appear that the iPhon econom appear intact.Dividend Safeti Analysis: AppleW analyz 25+ year of dividend data and 10+ year of fundament data to understand the safeti and growth prospect of a dividend. Apple' dividend and fundament data chart can all be seen byclick here.Our Dividend Safeti Score answer the question, ""I the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factor such as current and histor EP and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industri cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.Dividend Safeti Score rang from 0 to 100, and conserv dividend investor should stick with firm that score at least 60. Sinc track the data, compani cut their dividend had an averag Dividend Safeti Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduct announcements.W wrote a detail analysi review how Dividend Safeti Score are calculated, what their track record ha been, and how to use them for your portfoliohere.Apple' Dividend Safeti Score is 95, which indic that the dividend is not onli much safer than the averag dividend-pay stock in the market, but actual one of the safest overall. The strong safeti score is driven by rel low payout ratios, a healthi balanc sheet, strong busi economics, and low industri cyclicality.Sinc initi the dividend in 2012, Apple' free cash flow and EPSpayout ratioshav stay below 30%. For 2016, they are expect to gener EP of $8.28 and pay dividend of $2.23 per share. Thi impli a veri comfort payout ratio of 27% for 2016.Source: Simpli Safe DividendsSource: Simpli Safe DividendsApple' balanc sheet is one of the healthiest in corpor America. As of the end of the second quarter 2016, they have over $18 billion in cash and anoth $213 billion in short and long-term market securities.Thes market secur are mostli compos of U.S. treasuries, corpor debt, and mortgag and asset-back securities. Offset thi cash and market secur is $12.5 billion in commerci paper and a littl over $72 billion in current and long-term debt.Overall, Appl ha over $145 billion in net cash and market secur on the balanc sheet.To put some context behind just how much money sit on Apple' balanc sheetPepsiCo, Inc.(PEP),Intern Busi Machin Corp.(IBM),Walt Disney Co(DIS),Medtron PLC(MDT),Mastercard Inc(MA), and a whole host of other blue chip, multi-n busi have a market cap that is less than just the net cash and market secur on Apple' balanc sheet.On an annual basis, Appl pay about $12.2 billion in dividends. Thi mean that Appl can cover the current annual dividend payment for around 12 year with just the net cash and market secur on hand.Whil the major of the cash and market secur is locat outsid the U.S. and is not easili avail for a tax effici payout, Appl can issu debt in the US to financ capit return to shareholders. We do not expect thi dynam to chang anytim soon.Recently, the European Commiss announc that Ireland must recov up to $14.6 billion dollar in tax from Apple. If Appl would have to pay thi tomorrow, it would not be an issu for the compani given the net cash position. However, we believ the more like scenario is that the rule get tie up in court for years.A detail in the Busi Analysi section above, Appl gener robust econom that lead to signific free cash flow.W expect these econom to be persist as long as Appl is abl to maintain the price power and manufactur relationship for the iPhone. We will be close monitor the situation, but dividend investor should rest easi know that the Appl brand ha been strong for mani decades.Th last piec that lead to the phenomen Dividend Safeti Score is the histor stabil of Apple' end markets.Sinc the iPhon (and smart phone in general) were just gain mainstream penetr dure the financi crisis, that time period is not a good indic of how the busi will perform dure the next recession.Dur the next recession, individu will like defer upgrades, trade down to a cheaper phone, and/or purchas use iPhones. Thi could significantli impact sale for a year or two, but Apple' strong brand and featur addit should eventu stimul sale to inflect back upwards.Overall, we see veri littl risk to Apple' dividend over next few years. The factor that could lead to a dividend cut or suspens appear to be more tail risk event such as signific brand damag and/or technolog disruption. Even so, Apple' hoard of cash provid it with plenti of flexibl to continu pay dividend and make the right invest or acquisit to stay relevant.Dividend Growth AnalysisOur Growth Score answer the question, ""How fast is the dividend like to grow?"" It consid mani of the same fundament factor as the Safeti Score but place more weight on growth-centr metric like sale and earn growth and payout ratios. Score of 50 are average, 75 or higher is veri good, and 25 or lower is consid weak.Here' how Appl fare in thi critic measure…Apple' Dividend Growth Score is 89, which indic excel futur growth potential. Sinc start to pay a dividend in mid-2012, Appl ha grown it at around 10% per year on a full-year basis.Within reason, Appl could probabl grow their dividend as fast as they want. The combin of a rel low payout ratio, extraordinarili strong balanc sheet, and end market that should continu to grow can fuel dividend growth for mani to come.Source: Simpli Safe DividendsIn reality, Appl is like to keep up the roughli 10% per year growth rate for some time. The compani still view itself as a growth compani and is will to invest billion and billion of dollar into high risk, but high reward busi ventur in huge address market (autonom drive cars, payments, etc).Whil iPhon sale will be a bit choppi year to year depend on custom upgrad and new product introductions, we expect iPhon growth to continu to be strong over the cours of the next five years.AAPL Stock ValuationAppl current trade just below 13x 2016 earn estimates. These are rel low expect for a compani that ha an entrench competit particip and particip in larg grow markets. Whi are expect so low?W believ that expect are low becaus there are few preced for compani the size of Apple, fear over the iPhon product cycle, and investor unsur of what will lead the compani in the next stage of growth.Veri few compani in the cours of histori have reach the size of Apple.Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) briefli hit a $600 billion plu equiti valuat at the height of the dot-com boom, and investor who purchas at the peak are still down on their invest from late 1999.Thi bring in the all-import issu of the difficulti of growth when you at nearli $234 billion in sales. For Appl to grow sale by 10% from 2015 level which repres a near term peak, they would need to increas sale by over $23 billion dollars.Assum all the growth came from iPhon at an averag price point of $700, they would need to sell roughli an increment 32 million phones. Thi illustr the difficulti of grow at thi size and show whi Appl is look at other huge market (autonom cars, payments, etc).Al in all, investor in Appl have potenti to earn a doubl digit annual rate of return from these levels.Sourc of upsid to thi expect rate are from how Appl alloc it capital. If they are abl to success penetr other huge market and gener favor economics, anoth growth leg will ensue.Th main sourc of downsid to thi expect rate of return is a breakdown in the econom of the iPhone.Appl Conclusion: A Safe Dividend Stock With Double-Digit Futur GrowthAppl is go through a difficult stretch current with a lull in iPhon sale thi year and investor ponder the next growth driver for a compani that gener fiscal year 2015 sale of nearli $234 billion. However, none of these factor will lead to adividend cutin the near term.Pandora Media Inc (P) Is Rockin', But Don't Come A-Knockin'!Conversely, thi repres an opportun for investor to own a high qualiti busi that ha incred brand strength and custom intimaci at a reason valuat of roughli 13x earnings.Th dividend appear to be extrem safe and will continu to grow at a low doubl digit rate for the forese future.

3 Reasons Why My Millennial Friends Are Not Buying the iPhone 7;9/13/2016;"TheiPhon 7 is here, but competit is steeper than ever for AppleAAPL. SamsungSSNLFand other cell phone manufactur are nip at the heel of the Cupertino giant, and investor havemultipl reason for whi Appl may run into some obstacleswith regard to hold onto it larg market share in the smartphon industry.Improv batteri life, water resistance, more memory, and a better camera make the iPhon 7 a notabl upgrad from the iPhon 6s. However, there are reason for whi mani of my iPhone-wield friend (who are in their 20s) will be opt out of upgrad to the iPhon 7.No Headphon JackMost peopl have heard about thi by now, but I'll say it anyways. TheiPhon 7 doe not have the standard 3.5mm audio jackthat you'v been accustom to see on pretti much everi smartphon over the last decade. The devic doe ship with wireless headphon call AirPods, and they also come with an adaptor, but it ha a rectangular Lightn connector.Th problem that aris with thi is that user will not be abl to charg their phone while listen to music (or make calls) with wire headphon that have a Lightn connector. You could get a dongl that let you use wire headphon while charging, but that' anoth $40 dollar which you'd have to shell out.Furthermore, most headphon use 3.5mm jack to connect, and thi is still a veri popular way of listen to music sinc you get better sound qualiti without have to worri about the batteri life of your headphones. While Bluetooth technolog can help in dodg problem associ with a jack-less iPhon 7, sound qualiti is often sacrificed. Thi is a big deal for some of my millenni peers, and it is a viabl reason for whi they won't be upgrad toApple' latestflagship device.Look like the iPhon 6Now, the iPhon 7 is a great phone across most spec and it is also a clear upgrad from the iPhon 6. We'v establish this, and while the intern are different, Appl fail to give the exterior a complet makeover. In fact, the iPhon 7' height, width, and depth are exactli the same as the iPhon 6s (5.44 by 2.64 by 0.28 inches). The Lightn connector is in the same place, but the phone now sport a home button that' no longer physical.Appl made a bold choic by go with a design that is veri similar to it last smartphone, but user stand to feel disappoint by the lack of design change. In Naperville, a town close to where I live, everyon seem to have an iPhone. I wa hang out with a group of my friend in Napervil over the weekend and I ask them if they were excit about upgrad to the iPhon 7.Not surprisingly, most of them were put off by the fact that the phone doesn't look like much of a sequel to the iPhon 6 on the surface. They are hardcor Appl fans, but they worri about the phone not feel or look like much of an upgrad when they hold it. Like my friends, I also appreci the aesthet physic qualiti in ani new phone or devic I buy. I also admit that when I upgrade, I do take pride in receiv someth that look like a distinctli uniqu product.Wait for the iPhon 8While the iPhon 7 boast new hardwar upgrad compar to it predecessor, the devic seem like more of an increment upgrad as oppos to be a big step forward for Apple. Some specul that the iPhon 7' similar design to the iPhon 6 show that Appl is plan on make bigger chang for it next phone.Thi could give peopl reason to wait longer, and thi is troubl sinc there is an ongo trend of smartphon user wait longer befor replac their phones. Appl ha previous done well in get it user to upgrad their phone to the next version available, but it may now run into a problem that mani other cell phone manufactur face.Yesterday, my friend said that she is wait for the iPhon 8 becaus her iPhon 6 is alreadi great. The spec of the iPhon 7 didn't convinc her that an upgrad wa worth it, but she heard that the iPhon 8 would boast a larg screen that take up the entir front of the phone. I have also heard thi rumor and I think that thi would definit be an innov featur sinc it hasn't been tri yet2017 will be the 10thanniversari of the iPhone, and mani specul that Appl will realli kick thing up a notch when it reveal it next phone. Although the timelin dictat that thi would be the time where Appl releas the ""s"" version of it phone, it may skip that version altogether, similar to how Samsung jump right from the Galaxi Note 5 to theGalaxi Note 7.Bottom LineI am not say that millenni won't buy the iPhon 7. I am simpli relay my experi to show the thought process behind whi some younger peopl will choos to opt out of upgrad their iPhon 6 to Apple' latest phone.From it simplic to it exclusivity, there are mani thing that millenni appreci about the iPhon and Apple' brand. Unfortunately, there are a few let-down which could neg impact how Apple' latest phone reson with younger consumers.

1 Way the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Beats the Samsung Galaxy Note7;9/13/2016;"Imag source: Samsung.WhenApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduc the iPhon 7 Plus, the compani said it made the display significantli brighter and, for good measure, ad support for wide color. However, the resolut -- the number of pixel in the display -- remain unchang from both the iPhon 6 Plu and the iPhon 6s Plus.makeArticleAd();Thi ha led some industri follow and consum to conclud that the newest plus-siz iPhon fall behind theSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi Note7 by thi metric. Indeed, the display on the Galaxi Note7 measur 5.7 inch along the diagonal, at a resolut of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels.In contrast, the iPhon 7 Plu featur a display resolut of ""only"" 1,920 by 1,080 pixel on a 5.5-inch screen. Basic math will tell you that the Galaxi Note7 will featur higher pixel densiti and therefore, ha a sharper display than the compet iPhone.In thi case, however, basic math is highli misleading.Th dirti secret of the Note7 displayOn the iPhon 7 Plu display, each pixel is made up of three sub-pixels: red, blue, and green. That mean there are 1,920-by-1,080 each of red, green, and blue sub-pixels. Pretti straightforward, right?On the Galaxi Note7 display, it doesn't quit work like that. Accord toOLED-info, recent Samsung display use a technolog known as PenTile. The site explain that the sub-pixel arrang on Samsung display is known as a ""Diamond Pixel"". In a nutshell, thi Diamond Pixel arrang mean that instead of have each pixel consist of a red, green, and blue sub-pixel, it is instead made up oftwogreen sub-pixels, one red sub-pixel, and one blue sub-pixel.A a result, while the Note7 display pack more green sub-pixel in a given area than the display on the iPhon 7 Plus, the Appl offer pack more blue and red sub-pixel per inch than the Note7. DisplayM calcul that there are 518 green sub-pixel per inch on the Note7 display, while there are 401 sub-pixel per inch on the iPhon 7 Plus. But it place 401 each for blue and red on the iPhone, against 366 each on the Note7.So in a veri real sense, the iPhon 7 Plu display is actual ahead of the Note7 when it come to red/blu sub-pixel density.Th display comparison between the two phone isn't so clear cutTher are certainli area where the Note7 display will outperform it peer. For example, the Note7 display is an AMOLED, while the iPhon 7 Plu display is an LCD. That mean the contrast ratio of the Note7 display will be much superior. The Note7 also curv on the sides, while it is unlik that a mobil LCD would be abl to replic that design.However, Appl claim that the display on the iPhon 7 Plu can achiev 625 nit of brightness. AnandTech measur the maximum bright of the Note7 at just 359 nits, alreadi well below the 582 nit measur for the iPhon 6s Plu in that same article.Given that the iPhon 6s Plu is advertis at a maximum bright of 500 nits, well below what AnandTech measured, I wouldn't be surpris to see the display on the iPhon 7 Plu far exceed what Appl offici advertises.Th point, though, is that it doesn't make sens to critic the iPhon display simpli becaus it doesn't measur up to anoth flagship devic base on some random specification, especi one as mislead as pixel density.Apple' uphil challengeAt the end of the day, Appl ha a difficult market hurdl to overcom with respect to the Galaxi Note7 and other smartphon that use high-resolut AMOL display with a diamond sub-pixel structure. Consum typic don't read up on these detail and instead reli on the number includ in market materi or in reviews.Fortunately, although Appl is current at a resolution/pixel per inch market disadvantage, my expect is that peopl who actual look at these smartphon in person (at a retail store, for example) will find them quit comparable.Th Note7 wild cardSamsung is also suffer from a troubl turn of event that could veri well offset ani perceiv display advantag it offer with the Note7 -- explod batteries.Indeed, the compani recent announc amass recallof it Note7 phone due to thi issue. Apparently, Note7 batteri have actual blown up, and the situat ha snowbal to the point that the Unit State Consum Product Safeti Commiss is tell Note7 owner to ""power them down and stop charg or use the device"".Even if the Note7 sport a better display (or is simpli perceiv to offer one), the iPhon 7 Plu is like to enjoy a robust introduct and launch, boost Apple' share of the large-screen smartphon market at Samsung' expense. Samsung will be stuck deal with the fallout of it recal until the compani launch it next gener flagship devic next year.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

The phone' featur and technolog are compelling, but it' also clear that the visual appear and aesthet of the jet-black iPhon 7 Plu is also appeal to consumers.Moreover, it would seem that suppli is tighter for the jet-black iPhon 7 Plu than it is for the jet-black iPhon 7; Apple' site say that order place for the latter today will ship in ""3-4 weeks"" -- consider better than ""November.""Th bad news, though, is that Appl seem to have grossli underestim the demand it would see for thi particular variant of the iPhon 7 Plus. Bar that, Appl simpli can't make enough of these phone to meet demand in a time fashion, perhap becaus the devic is simpli more difficult to manufactur than the other versions.In the best case for Apple, potenti jet-black iPhon 7 Plu buyer will either place their order and choos to wait the addit two month for the devic or simpli choos a more readili avail iPhon 7 Plu variant.In a not-so-good case for Apple, frustrat potenti buyer could opt to buy smartphon from a competitor.

If so, what implic could it have on Samsung and, potentially, the semiconductor landscap as a whole? Let' take a closer look.Squar thing up with busi realitiesAlthough Samsung ha made quit a lot of nois around it contract chip manufactur business, it doesn't appear to be particularli successful. For a while, Samsung had a larg anchor custom in the form ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and it A-seri processors. Up until the A8, Samsung wa Apple' sole manufactur partner for these chips.However, Samsung wa complet shut out of the A8, with TSMC win all of those orders. Samsung wa back in the loop with Apple' A9, and it even reportedli got the major of the chip order for that generation, but it' believ that Apple' recent announc A10 Fusion chip is, onc again, a TSMC exclusive.Accord to Econom Daili News, TSMC is go to be the exclus supplier of the A11 chip on it upcom 10-nanomet manufactur technolog -- someth that jibe with TSMC' ownmarket share expectationsdur the 10-nanomet generation.From a busi perspective, Samsung' decis to de-emphas leading-edg chip manufactur almost seem like a no-brainer. If Appl is gone and if Qualcomm wa alreadi plan to ditch Samsung for TSMC at the 7-nanomet gener anyway, then what incent doe Samsung have to continu to make the signific capit expenditur and research-and-develop invest requir to stay competit here?In contrast, if a broad shift to OLE display in smartphon and other applic is immin -- Appl is expect to adopt OLE for it 2017 iPhones, for exampl -- and if Samsung is a lead manufactur of such displays, then it might make a lot of sens to invest in capac and technolog to capit on thi demand and tri to maintain a strong competit positioning.Th implic for the semiconductor industri at largeIf Samsung were to effect ""drop out"" as a contract chip manufacturer, then thi would probabl prove to be a near- to medium-term posit for TSMC. With veri littl competit in leading-edg technologies, TSMC gain price power, which could help it to maintain or even grow it gross profit margin, which came in at an impress 51.5% last quarter and is expect to be in the rang of 50% to 52% in the current quarter.Conversely, thi would be a neg for compani that reli on contract chip manufactur to build design on cutting-edg chip manufactur technologies; TSMC' gain price power could mean increas cost for these companies, ultim lead to lower gross profit margin for them.Thi could also open up an opportun for microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) to tri to step in and potenti fill the void that Samsung might leav behind.

A Triple Win for This Apple Inc.

In fact, not onli did TSMC wind up share the A9 with Samsung -- after TSMC had won the entireti of the prior-gener A8 order -- but it wa also wide report that it wound up with a minor alloc of the orders.Tough break, eh?Bi go from a minor supplier of the A9 to the sole provid of the A10, TSMC stand to enjoy a nice year-over-year boost in revenu dure thi iPhon product cycle, though it will be offset somewhat by the fact that Apple' mid-tier iPhon will go from be TSMC-exclus to split between TSMC and Samsung.A larger chip size should drive even more wafer salesChip are essenti ""printed"" onto silicon wafer of a fix diamet -- in the case of the A10 and other leading-edg chips, that diamet is 300 millimet or just under 12 inches. The individu chip -- refer to as die -- are then cut out of those wafer and then packag for use.Last year' A9 measur in at 104.5 squar millimet in TSMC' 16-nanomet manufactur technology, accord to a measur from Chipworks.In a recent column, I estim that the A10 measur in at 147 squar millimet -- substanti larger than the A9 chip it replaces. The fact that the A10 is so much larger mean that, for a given unit volume, Appl will requir more wafer to meet that demand. Sinc TSMC sell wafers, the combin of the larger chip size and the sole sourc arrang mean that the chipmak is like to gener alotmor revenu from thi iPhon cycl than the prior-gener one.A packag win, tooIt isbelievedthat in addit to handl the wafer fabric duties, sever report suggest that the chipmak is also provid chip-packag servic to Appl with it new Integr Wafer Level Wan-Out, or InFO packag technology.Th amount of increment dollar content from thi win is like to be far less than win all of the chip order or the signific chip die size increas in go from the A9 to the A10, but it' addit revenu and profit dollar in TSMC' coffers. In my book, anyway, that' a ""win.""TSMC ha Apple, but the struggl continuesRight now, TSMC is arguabl Apple' most import chip partner.

While the acquisit may better posit HP to acceler it plan to make inroad on the copier segment, the move also come with meaning risk.Here' what investor need to know.Whi Samsung' printer business?HP' choic to acquir Samsung' printer segment wa base on the belief that the company' A3 MFPs, or multifunct printers, are superior technolog to copier and can replac them.HP explain the rational in it press release:Copi are outdated, complic machin with dozen of replac part requir ineffici servic and mainten agreements. Custom are frequent frustrat with the number of visit need to keep copier machin functioning. Today, HP is invest to disrupt thi categori by replac copier with superior multifunct printer (MFP) technology.Samsung ha built a formid portfolio of A3 MFP that deliv the perform of copier with the power, simplicity, reliabl and ease-of-us of printer and with as few as seven replac parts. Integr the Samsung printer business' products, includ their mobile-first and cloud-first user experience, with HP' next-gener PageWid technolog will creat a breakthrough portfolio of print solut with the industry' best device, document, and data security.A part of the deal, Samsung agre to invest $100 million to $300 million in HP through open-market purchas after closing, demonstr it confid in the direct HP is take it business.Furthermore, the deal, which is expect to close in about 12 months, entail HP' acquisit of Samsung' portfolio of more than 6,500 print patents.RisksIn theory, thi acquisit sound great. As HP explain in it press release, it creat ""new avenu for growth"" for the compani as industri sale model ""shift from transact to contractual."" But it' imposs to ignor the heat competit in the copier space and headwind in the printer space in general.Bi move into the A3 copier segment with the Samsung deal, HP will be up against establish rivals, such asXerox(NYSE: XRX) ,Canon, andRicoh. These player are unlik to let HP come in and ""disrupt"" the industri as easili as HP make it sound.Furthermore, the printer segment is question overal as demand declin for printer and supplies. For instance, in HP' most recent quarter, print revenu declin 14% year over year and 5% sequentially. And it higher-margin suppli subsegment, which account for 64% of it print revenue, saw revenu declin 18% year over year and 8% sequentially. And Xerox' declin revenu in it document technolog business, which is made up of sale of printer and copier product and supplies, and the associ mainten and financ of these products, doesn't help justifi a case for growth opportun in the A3 copier segment. Xerox' document technolog busi report revenu of $1.8 billion in the company' most recent quarter, down 7% year over year.Befor the deal' expect closing, in 12 months, HP investor should care consid whether a move into the highli competit A3 copier space realli make sense.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Fitbit Inc: Why the Commoditization Risk Is Overblown (FIT);9/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt would be easier to pick a stock that could doubl it price in one year than to read aboutFitbit Inc(FIT) stock without read - for the umpteenth time - how it is perform woefulli thi year.Indeed, Fitbit stock is down by about 50% so far thi year on back of worri regard the futur of the company. Put simply, fear lurk around the invest sphere that Fitbit' product can beeasili commoditized.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');It shrink lead in the wearabl market ha not been help to allay such fears. IDC estim that FIT had about 25% of the wearabl market as of the end of the first quarter. FIT had 33% of the wearabl market as of end of 2015 first quarter.Al of these have driven short interest in FIT stock up by roughli 82% year-to-date.EvenGoPro Inc(GPRO), whose situat help fuel fear about market commoditization, have never seen such widespread bearish sentiment.However, here' whi investor shouldn't be so worried.Risk of Lose Lead Market Share Is OverblownA referenc above, fear of market commodit ha contribut a great deal to the crippl condit of Fitbit stock. Apart from commoditization, though, the entranc ofAppleInc.(AAPL) into the wearabl market through the Appl Watch also ad to the worries, as investor fear that Appl is big enough to outmuscl Fitbit stock in no time. However, the bear are miss some advantag that FIT stock ha go for it.5 Stock to Buy for SeptemberFirst, even though the wearabl market is sincer prone to commoditization, Fitbit' focu on health make a whole lot of difference. For instance, in the corpor world, where Fitbit stock is tri to help compani up their employees' health through it corpor well program, it is in unlik that corpor bodi would think, ""There are cheaper option out there, whi not go for those?"" And by cheaper options, I mean similar wearabl produc by solopreneur who just want to have a slice of the market.Corpor bodi would rather stick with a name they know and can hold respons or trust for quick help especi sinc health is involved, accord toStarl Capital. Moreover, the bear are miss that point that the first-mov advantag exist for ani compani that offer product and servic tie to healthcare.To make thing more practical, consid the smartphon mobil market. Thi market ha been commoditized. One just need to look at the develop world, where smartphonescostless than $100 on the average, to understand. But that didn't not make leader like Appl andSamsung Electronic(SSNLF) less relevant. That' becaus they simpli offer more than just sell phone.In the same vein, market commodit won't drive Fitbit into oblivion overnight because, like Appl and Samsung, it just doesn't make wearables. It ha bundl servic that give it more valu proposit than the averag commoditizer. Moreover, it ha more cash and investor support to withstand a market commoditization.Whi Don't You Just Buy Facebook Stock, Dammit? (FB)So while, market commodit would obvious limit the extent to which Fitbit can penetr the market, it is still well posit to stay on top. In addition, investor have to bear in mind that Fitbit' fit wearabl market is still veri much in a nascent stage. As the market grows, Fitbit will sure get bigger.Th Bottom Line: FIT is a BargainWith Fitbit in a good posit to grow it revenu by 35% thi year, follow a 100%-plu increas in 2015, investor just have to see the current depress in Fitbit stock as a buy opportunity. Moreover, it valuat look good, with it one-year forward PE ratio stand at 10.40, which is better than bigger competitor, Apple's, one-year forward PE of 11.96.

Video of swimmer complet submerg their Appl Watch abound in the presentation, along with a present on how Appl engin reposit the speaker on the Seri 2 to push water out after it' been dunk in water.And lastly, Appl updat some of the internals, includ a brighter display, an improv graphic processor, and a new dual-cor S2 processor that' 50% faster than the previou generation. Apple' also upgrad the processor in the first gener Appl Watch.Whi these increment upgrad matterNon of these upgrad are revolutionary, and almost all of them were alreadi anticipated. But here' whi simple, increment upgrad will be enough for the company' smartwatch: Appl is alreadi the No. 1 smartwatch vendor in the world and (a it humbl point out in it presentation) it' also the No. 2 watch vendor worldwide.In short, Appl doesn't need major upgrades, gimmicks, or anyth els to move it smartwatch off the shelves.Samsung releas it first Gear smartwatch more than three year ago and ha pepper the market with a hand of wearabl devic sinc then (it' alreadi on the third version of it smartwatch). And yet Samsung ship 1 million fewer smartwatch in Q2 2016 than Appl did.Imag source: Apple.Appl still trail Fitbit in overal wearabl shipment numbers, but Apple' meteor rise in the wearabl space in such short time mean the compani doesn't have much to worri about.Fitbit ha been make wearabl tech devic for about seven year and current ha nine wearabl product on the market. The compani introduc it own smartwatch (the Blaze) recent and continu to releas new iter of it popular fit trackers.Whil Fibit is the undisput wearabl tech king, the compani is fight like mad to keep that position. The company' oper expens more than doubl in the most recent quarter, year over year, as Fitbit pour more money into research and develop and marketing. And that' subsequ push down gross margin from 46.8% last year to the current 41.8%.All of thi indic that Fitbit is run at a rapid pace in order to stay ahead of Appl -- meanwhil the Appl Watch maker is take a leisur stroll and still gain more ground in the wearabl market.Th bottom lineTh smartwatch market is still in it earli stage and there' plenti of time for Appl to build out it watch offer even further, and possibl add other wearabl tech devic into the mix.Appl will probabl continu to bring slow, increment upgrad to the Appl Watch (a thinner design is the most likely, along with an eventu LTE connection). But Appl is do what it alway doe -- pace itself for the long distanc race and leav it competitor to sweat it out in the short term.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Needs the Series 2 Watch to Sell Well, But Will It?;9/9/2016;"At it highli anticip keynot event on Wednesday, AppleAAPLunveil the Appl Watch Seri 2, the second gener of it smartwatch device. The Seri 2 boast a plethora of new features, and the tech giant will hope the new product can reinvigor slump Watch sales.Weak SalesAppl is firmli in control of the smartwatch market, but that doesn't mean that Appl Watch sale have live up to expectations. The compani remain tight-lip on specif sale number for the device, but it did say at Wednesday' keynot that it is number one in worldwid smartwatch sales.Nevertheless, a report from the Intern Data Corp (IDC) in Juli claim that Appl Watch sale fell 55% in the second quarter. With global smartwatch sale fall 32% in the same time period, Appl definit took a brutal hit, especi as competitor like LenovoLNVGYand SamsungSSNLFsaw sale increas by 50% in the quarter (also read:IDC Say Appl Watch Shipment Drop 55%).Whi have Appl Watch sale been slumping? Well, a varieti of factor go into it worldwid sale performance, but it seem reason to assum that custom are either uninspir by the devic or opt for a competitor' version of the smartwatch.To remedi both of these problems, the Appl Watch Seri 2 need to be innovative, unique, and affordable. Now that Appl ha offici announc the product, we can look to see whether the compani ha success tackl those three points.Seri 2 FeaturesTh new gener of Appl Watch will includ a dual-cor processor that promis to be 50% faster than the origin version. It also boast a 2x brighter screen, make it Apple' brightest display to date. To help improv movement tracking, the Seri 2 will featur a built-in GPS, and the new devic will ""learn"" about you through a new algorithm that track your daili activity. Design wise, there will be new cases, includ aluminum, stainless steel, and ceramic, as well as new watch bands.Perhap the ""coolest"" new featur of the Seri 2 is it water-resist capabilities. Appl promis that the watch will be ""swim-proof,"" mean it can handl depth of up to 50 meters. Almost no other major smartwatch manufactur have a swim proof option, and even Fitbit'sFITfit tracker can't be brought into the pool.Appl also announc a partnership with NikeNKE; execut from the fit apparel giant were on-hand Wednesday to announc the Appl Watch Nike +, a fitness-focus version of the new smartwatch that make it easier to incorpor into workout and encourag user to go on run and be active.Alongsid the announc of the Seri 2, Appl announc it latest Watch-bas oper system, Watch OS3. The new OS will allow user to swipe the edg of their devic to switch watch faces, and it will includ new anim stickers, custom repli scribbling, improv to typing, an activ share app, and an ""SOS"" app.Onc again, price remain a concern with the Seri 2. The new version start at $369, while the Seri 1 will receiv a processor upgrad and will retail at $269. In comparison, Fitbit' Blaze is just $199 and Samsung' Gear S2 start at $249.99.Bottom LineWith worldwid smartwatch sale slump significantli in the second quarter, the demand for these type of devic is at a low right now. That mean that ani new product enter the market must be competit in both design and price.Th Appl Watch Seri 2 is now the most power smartwatch on the market and it swim-proof capabl are unparalleled. With that said, it' still a veri prici device, and mani of it compar competitor are more affordable.Thi doesn't feel like the outright win that Appl need to ensur long-term Appl Watch success, but it should inspir some shopper head into the holiday season. I expect Appl to be more open about it Watch sale if thing do pick up, so investor should pay attent to that.For more coverag on Apple' keynot thi week, check out the latest episod of theZack Friday Finish Linepodcast:W the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

Appl ha said it won't be reveal launch weekend iPhon 7 numbers.Source: AppleWhat' up with that?makeArticleAd();On of the primari reason whi AAPL ha been so success is it domin in smartphon sales. Yes,Alphabet Inc' (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Googl ha a far larger platform market share with it Android oper system. And arch-rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) sell more mobil phone overal than Apple. But when it come to flagship smartphon sale - the devic that peopl clamor for and that actual drive profit - the latest and greatest new iPhon is alway the one to beat.Thes iPhon sale numbers, which invari set a new sale record, go a long way toward predict the success a new model will have dure the cours of the year, and are use by investor to help gaug the impact on AAPL stock.7 Must-Own Tech Stock With REAL Dividend GrowthIn 2013, the iPhon 5s and iPhon 5c were launched.

Thi beg the question: whi break with the long-stand tradition?Here' Apple' explan for the move:""Thes initi sale will be govern by supply, not demand, and we have decid that it is no longer a repres metric for our investor and customers.""In other words, due to limit suppli (there have been report that somecompon suffer manufactur defectsthat have affect iPhon 7 launch availability), Appl is certain the iPhon 7 will sell out on launch weekend. Not onli that, but it feel it would be abl to sell mani more new iPhon than it will have available, therefor ani launch weekend sale number would be artifici low.Appl Inc. iPhon 7 and iPhon 7 Plu Spec (and Price (AAPL)That make sense, but here' the thing. Previou new iPhon sale have also suffer from launch shortages. Some custom wait month to get their hand on an iPhon 6. A shortag of iPhon 5 unit due to manufactur issu with it display cut into that smartphone' launch weekend sales.Hav full warehous for launch weekend isalwaysa challenge, and not just for Apple. Ani time a manufactur ramp up product of a new devic - often requir assembl of compon suppli by dozen of third parti - it take time befor all the bug are iron out and the product line is humming.So whi is Appl use the suppli shortag lead to sellout excus to skip it annual tradit of releas new iPhon open weekend sale numbers?It doesn't take a conspiraci theorist to specul that perhap the compani is worri that alreadi flat iPhon sale combin with an increment updat iPhon 7 and potenti backlash over it decis to elimin the headphon jack are go to combin for tepid sales.A press releas state iPhon 7 launch weekend sale fail to beat last year' number - even with ani market speak about sell out - would not be pretti for AAPL.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace:Appl Inc.

iPhone 7 Could Be Less Profitable For Apple;9/7/2016;"Appl (AAPL) is slate to unveil it latest iPhon (presum call iPhon 7) on Wednesday. The iPhon product line ha been face challenges, amid competit from well-receiv Android based-devic and slow demand in China, result in fall shipment and weaker ASPs. While the iPhon 7 - which is rumor to sport improv cameras, better water resist and perform upgrad - may improv iPhon demand in the interim, we believ that it could put pressur on Apple' margins. Below, we outlin some reason for this.Trefi ha a $120 price estim for Apple, which is slightli below the current market price.Se our complet analysi for Appl heremakeArticleAd();High Storag Can Skew Demand Toward Base ModelsAppl ha been offer it base iPhon 6 and 6S seri with just 16 GB of memori (under 12 GB of usabl space - bare enough for mainstream customers), with 64 GB and 128 GB version price at $100 increments. Thi ha work out veri well for Apple' margins, as a larg portion of custom opt for the higher-end models, drive up ASPs. The 64 GB device, for instance, like cost an addit $15 to $20 to manufactur compar to the 16 GB device, while retail price are $100 higher. However, Appl is rumor to be offer the iPhon 7 with 32 GB of base storag - which could be suffici for most typic users, with price point like be left unchanged. Thi could skew the sale mix toward the entry-level device, lower margin and ASPs. Moreover, there could be increment cost associ with doubl memori across the product line (32/128/256GB).iPhon Plu Bill Of Materi Cost Will RiseTh iPhon Plu model have also been significantli accret for Apple' margins. For instanc IH estim that the iPhon 6S Plu cost just about $20 more to manufactur compar to the iPhon 6S, although it retail at a $100 premium. While we expect price point on the new Plu devic to remain similar to last year' models, it is possibl that it could get more expens to manufacture. For instance, the dual-len camera - rumor to be the marque featur of the iPhon 7 - is like to be exclus to the Plu device.Yield rateson these components- which are still uncommon in the smartphon industri - are like low, make them potenti expensive. KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estim that these camera could rais Apple' cost by about $40.

None of those devic were big hit with consumers, and GoPro' sale rose just 16% for the year, down from 41% growth in 2014.Imag source: GoPro.makeArticleAd();Demand for the Session wa so weak that GoPro had to slash it price from $400 to $200 befor ani buyer show up. Margin fell as sale of the cheaper devic cannib those of the higher-end ones, so GoPro discontinu the entry-level Hero, Hero+, and Hero+ LCD earlier thi year. GoPro now onli sell three camera -- the Hero 4 Session, Silver, and Black.Look ahead, the holiday quarter will be a crucial one for GoPro, sinc it plan to final releas it new Hero 5 flagship devic and it long-delay Karma drone. Analyst expect sale of those two devic to boost GoPro' fourth quarter revenu by 54% annually, help it finish the year with a 14% sale decline. Unfortunately, the recent leak spec for the Hero 5 indic that the new flagship camera won't repres a huge leap forward from the Hero 4.Imag source: GoPro.I thi the GoPro Hero 5?Leak imagesof the Hero 5 indic that the devic will have a similar form factor as GoPro' current lineup of cameras, contrari toearlier reportswhich suggest that it would retain the Session' cube-lik design. The two biggest chang appear to be a touchscreen on the back and a built-in waterproof housing.Mirrorless Blogclaim that the devic will have a USB-C connector, a slightli larger 1,220 mAh battery, a built-in GPS, and support for voic controls. The leak spec also indic that imag stabil would be avail for all the models, but would onli work on resolut under 4K.It also appear that the highest-qu video mode for all model would be 4K at 30 fps. If that' true, it wouldmer matchth Hero 4 Black' highest video setting. Like the Hero 4 Black, the Hero 5 is expect to offer higher frame rate (a high as 120 fps) at lower resolutions.

Given the length of chip develop cycles, it would be unrealist to expect a substanti design chang in a product releas so soon after the latest generation.That said, the Snapdragon 821 run it processor core and graphic engin at higher frequencies, which should lead to increas performance. AnandTech say that the Snapdragon 820 run it high-perform processor core at 2.15GHz and it lower-perform processor core at 1.59GHz. The Snapdragon 821, on the other hand, bump the former up to 2.34GHz and the latter to 2.19GHz. The graphic processor see a boost in frequenc from 624 MHz to 653 MHz as well.Thes improv in the speed of the processor core should help overal performance, includ web surf and app usage. The graphic boost should make game and other graphic intens applic like virtual realiti run more smoothly.Th begin of more aggress product segment for Qualcomm?It would appear that Qualcomm is tri to get more aggress about segment it product line in a bid to improv it averag sell price and, ultimately, profitability.Qualcomm alreadi categor it product broadli by tier (i.e., Snapdragon 200-seri for entry-level phones, Snapdragon 400-seri for mid-range, Snapdragon 600-seri for high-end, and Snapdragon 800-seri for ""premium"" phones), but I think it could benefit from addit segment within those tiers. By releas the Snapdragon 821, Qualcomm is offer potenti custom the opportun to pay a bit more to get even stronger performance.For some custom such as Samsung, that premium clearli wasn't worth it. Samsung' new Galaxi Note 7, for example, doesn't featur the Snapdragon 821 but the older Snapdragon 820. Compani with signific brand power, like Samsung, probabl don't see the valu in pay more for a market point that will like be ignor by the vast major of their customers.However, it' worth note thatASUSTek, a compani well-known in the person comput market but less so for smartphones, is adopt the Snapdragon 821 in it ZenFon 3 famili of products.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Tacks on Important New Services, Features;8/30/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWord like ""exciting"" and ""Fitbit stock"" have not been compat sinceFitbit Inc' (NYSE:FIT) IPO last year. The compani ha done everyth right, answer it critics, yet FIT can't seem to catch a break.Source:Deni Kortunov via Flickr (Modified)It almost seem like the more that Fitbit manag beat expect and rais guidance, the louder critic become. Well, explain stock perform can onli happen so long befor logic start to prevail. In the case of Fitbit stock, it is final start to creep higher.makeArticleAd();With the company' vision becom clear, the end of 2016 is set up to be quit special for FIT stock owners.Critic for FIT StockFitbit ha had mind-boggl growth. It IPO came the same year thatAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) enter the wearabl market. While Fitbit onli oper in the basic wearabl market, it still finish 2015 as the No.1 wearabl company.It first smartwatch, the Blaze, went on to sell million of unit and be a commerci success despit not use Android or iO oper systems. In the world of connect and smart hardware, Fitbit is one of the onli compani we have seen to have success use an oper system that' not iO or Android.Th Best ETFs: A Special ReportDespit all of thi success, the big knock against Fitbit and FIT stock is that the compani doe not have a recur revenu stream. It' all hardwar and one-tim sale - Wall Street doe not like that. It mean that investor are alway look ahead, and wonder how long Fitbit can hold off tech juggernauts. That' whi I have said repeatedli that Fitbit need tolaunch serviceswithin it network, and creat an ecosystem.Fitbit: The Vision Becom ClearHowever, what Fitbit is do might be even better. On Monday, the compani announc aslew of new featuresand design to both it best-sel Alta and Blaze, along with product refresh for two other units.Furthermore, the compani is partner with lead fashion brand like Public School, Vera Wang,Kohl' Corporation(NYSE:KSS), and Tori Burch to deliv accessori options. Thi give those specif brand an incent to showcas Fitbit products. Furthermore, it allow user to person their products.Speak of which, Fitbit is roll out new softwar that includ five new clock faces, someth I had previous suggested. Thi give an ad layer for custom products, which seem to be Fitbit' prefer direction.It is becom quit clear that the second segment that Fitbit need is accessories. The compani ha launch countless band to custom it wearabl and now ha brand-specif accessori along with new clock faces. Hence, Fitbit is make it wearabl more stylish, and by do so, it creat an opportun to up-sel the million of devic it ha sold over the last few years.Finally, Fitbit' new softwar updat will allow user to custom the notif they receiv from app like Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, Skype, Snapchat and WhatsApp, among others. Thus, Fitbit' Blaze just becam a lot more like Appl Watch, but still cheaper and still easier to use.A previous reported, Fitbit CEO Jame Parkknow better than anyonewhat user want with their smartwatch. These notif are yet one more example.Caesar Entertain Corp (CZR): The Shell Game Is OverPark realiz that a watch is too small for interact apps, but is perfect for notif sinc most consum carri their watch with them, but don't alway have their smart watch in hand. Ultimately, embrac notif over app is yet one more decis that should bode well for Fitbit sale move forward.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockAl thing considered, I still think Fitbit need to do more around servic and softwar to creat recur revenu streams.However, I also believ that build softwar around notif and custom hardwar is the way to go for a compani that' compet against iO and Android. These move make sense, and with Fibit creat a second segment in accessori and now refresh softwar and legaci hardware, there are reason to be optimist about Fitbit stock in the final month of 2016.Remember, Fitbit wask of the holidayslast year, and realli ha not miss a beat since. FIT is now trade at just 10x fiscal year 2017 earnings-per-shar and ha the potenti to blow past it own expect with so mani new accessories, product refreshes, and the likelihood for Blaze and Alta upgrad ahead of the holidays.With nearli 40% of Fitbit stock' float be short, and with it so cheap, there is a high likelihood that FIT stock soar to end 2016.A of thi writing, Brian Nichol own Fitbit and Apple.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Compani That Could Go Bankrupt Soon7 Rare Valu Stock in Thi Overpr MarketTh postFitbit Inc (FIT) Tack on Import New Services, Featuresappear first onInvestorPlace."

But for comparison' sake, iPhon gener $31 billion in Q3 2015 alone.With the Appl Watch 2, Appl clearli hope to boost those numbers.7 Stock That Could Fall to the ""Restaur Recession""Th primari strategi will be releas a second-gener product that address the key complaint about version one.What to Expect From Appl Watch 2The origin Appl Watch wasn't perfect, but it success in captur over 60% of the market in 2015 suggest AAPL got mani of the design fundament right the first time. So don't expect ani shock chang with the Appl Watch 2. It' not go to do an about-fac from squar to circular, for exampl - despit that trend with compet smartwatches.Skip radic chang avoid the appear that Appl is flail and make it easier on app developers, who don't have to make signific UI chang between first and second gener devices. It also keep accessori compatibility, avoid anger earli adopt who invest in expens add-on Appl Watch band like the $690 Hermè Cuff.Instead, expect Appl to fine-tun that origin design.Among the expect chang with the Appl Watch 2 are:Fast CPU for improv performanceHigh capac batteri for longer lifeBuilt-in GP and barometerImprov water resistanceTh chang are all focus on address critic of the origin Appl Watch. Particularli that it is too slow when use app and suffer short batteri life. Health and fit track also remain a key objective.Th origin Appl Watch wa good - with excel app and hardwar like a heart rate sensor. But it need an iPhon nearbi to track distanc accur by GPS. The addit of a GPS, baromet and improv water resist will help AAPL to posit the Appl Watch 2 as a full-featur and standalon altern to fit tracker from Fitbit.For months, rumor had the Appl Watch 2 be equip with an LTE radio. Thi would let it break the iPhon tether altogether. It appear thatconcern over the batteri drain of a cellular chiphav quash those plans. At least for thi year …When Will Appl Watch 2 Arrive?That is the big question. Not if, but when. AAPL took it time in introduc the original, but that devic ha been on sale for over a year.

Is This Apple iPhone 7 Leak Legit?;8/26/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expect to unveil next-gener iPhon at an event earli next month. Although quit a lot ha been leak about these new devices, there' still plenti about them that we won't know for certain until Appl actual launch them.makeArticleAd();That be said, pre-launch rumor are interesting, and I believ it' worthwhil to tri to sniff out whether a particular leak is legitim or just a cleverli done fake design to grab attention. To that end, I'd like to look at arec leakvia Tencent Digit to see if it make sense.Th leak show a number of things: result of a common mobil processor perform test known as Geekbench 3, a new display feature, and the name of the device. Let' dig into each of these separately.Geekbench 3 scoreWhenev Appl launch a new iPhone, it like to highlight the perform improv that it ha brought to the tabl rel to the prior-gener phone. The two main comparison that Appl make are in CPU performance. (Thi impact how fast the phone run most non-gaming/3D graphics-intens applications.)Th leak doesn't tell us about what enhanc to graphic Appl may have made with the A10 chip, but it doe -- if it' legitim -- tell us what advanc Appl ha made on the CPU side of things. Per the leak, the next-gener iPhon achiev a 3,042 single-cor score and a 5,210 multi-cor score in Geekbench 3. I ran the test on my iPhon 6s Plu (power by aSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) -built A9 chip), and my devic achiev a single-cor score of 2,523 and a multi-cor score of 4,358.If the leak is repres of the A10' final performance, then we'r look at a per-cor perform improv of nearli 21% and a dual-cor perform improv of 20%.Given that the A10 won't have the benefit of an enhanc manufactur technology, which mean that all of the improv are come from design/architectur work on Apple' part, 20% improv is impressive, but not out of the realm of possibility. So, at the veri least, I believ thi portion of the leak is legitimate.New display featureAn imag that wa part of the same leak show that the new iPhon offer the user the option to enabl a ""true tone"" display. Thi wa a featur that first made it debut on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro that launch back in March. Thi feature, accord to Apple, ""use advanc four-channel ambient light sensor to automat adapt the color and intens of the display to match the light in your environment.""Speak from person experience, thi featur is realli quit nice, and actual make the transit from use my iPad Pro to my iPhon 6s a littl difficult. I'd be shock if Appl omit thi featur from a next-gener iPhone, so thi portion of the leak check out for me.A strang nameTh leak also show that the Geekbench 3 test identifi the phone not as the iPhon 7, but instead, as the iPhon 6 SE. I'v alreadi written about whi such brand would be noth short of aterr market decision, and I stand by that belief.Th last thing that Appl need to do with thi new iPhon -- the devic that' go to be the company' best shot at put it iPhon busi back on a growth path -- is to give consum the impress that the new devic is mere a modest, increment updat to the current-gener devices.It' not clear to me whi the Geekbench 3 benchmark identifi the devic as the iPhon 6 SE, but I would be stun if thi were the offici market name for thi device.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Intern will be tweaked, and the iPhon 7 Plu will like get an improv dual camera system. But there' littl excit around it.In fact, the current specul around the iPhon 7 is that it won't be call that at all. Instead, Appl might dub it theiPhon 6SE. If that one pan out, it would feel like even AAPL wa shrugging.Th Best ETF on the Planet: A Special ReportTh iPhon 8 could be radic different.So with littl excit around the iPhon 7, attent is start to be filter even further into the future.Appl is move to athree-year product cycl on it iPhones, make 2017 and the iPhon 8 the next big release.

Year after year, the physic button is there on the bottom of the iPhone' front face. Sure, Appl ha improv it. Notably, build in the Touch ID fingerprint sensor wa a big leap forward. But it ha alway been there.However,Bloomberg'sMark Gurman report yesterday thatth icon button is on it way out:""Appl is alreadi at work on a major redesign of the iPhon for 2017 that focus more heavili on the display by remov the Home button""AsMacRumorspoint out, Appl design guru Joni Ive ha long want to build an iPhon with a front that lack bezel andlook like a singl sheet of glass.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone SE Is Failing in India: What Investors Should Know;8/25/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha hope for a while now that it iPhon would find their foot in India, the world' second-largest smartphon market.Th compani ha madesomeprogress in the country, with India recent allow Appl to open it own store in the country. That will eventu allow Appl to sell phone directli to consumers, instead of through third-parti retail like it doe now.makeArticleAd();But newsmartphon shipment datarec releas by IDC brought back to light Apple' problem in India.Th IDC data show that Appl still trail behind the market leaderSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) in the countri and is fight an uphil battl against Chines vendor as well.Th new iPhon SE, debut back in March, wa suppos to help Appl gain a foothold in India. The devic sport a 4-inch Retina display, 12-megapixel rear camera, and is power by Apple' A9 processor and M9 motion co-processor.But despit the spec and cheaper price (it start at $399 in the U.S.), the phone is fail to deliv in India. Accord to IDC, ""Apple' iPhon SE fail to make ani signific impact in the premium segment while it previou gener iPhon 5S continu to contribut major volume.""Appl is, of course, expens in India. The averag price for a smartphon in the countri is about $150, and Apple' phone begin sell in India for 39,000 rupe (about $580). For that price, consum can easili get a larger Android devic with similar spec and much more intern memory.Th iPhon SE not onli fail to make a dent in the country' smartphon market, but it wa also unsuccess in captur the major of the high-end market. That posit belong to Chines vendors, which now hold one-third of the high-end market in India (up from just 9% a year ago).That growth ha been spread out amongLenovo, Xiaomi and some other Chines companies. In the past, Lenovo wa the onli Chines vendor to ship over 1 million smartphon in India in a quarter. Now there are three Chines vendor do it.Wher Appl goe from hereAppl is much closer to sell it phone from it own store in India after a recent propos wa ratifi by India' financ minister. Thi mean that Apple, and other single-brand compani that make high-tech goods, don't have to follow India' current law that requir foreign compani to sourc at least 30% of their devices' materi from India.Hav Appl store in India might eventu help the company' brand in the country, but I think the onli way the iPhon maker is go to make ani headway is to lower prices.Apple' iPhon manufacturer, Foxconn, is build a new plant in India that' rumor to be for Appl devic production. If it is, and Appl make some of it iPhon in India, then the compani may be abl to lower it iPhon price to better compet with other companies.Or, it could simpli drop the price befor that in order to gain some sliver of market share. At thi point, Appl need to be more aggress in get Indian consum to buy it devic -- and it' becom increasingli clear that the iPhon SE isn't the best strategy.India is too larg of a market for Appl to keep get it wrong. If the company' notori high margin have to be shave just a littl in order to increas sales, then it might just be well worth the sacrifice.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

If NVIDIA Corporation Goes to Samsung, It Won’t Stay Long;8/19/2016;"Imag credit: NVIDIA.Ther ha been somespeculationin the press that graphic specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) will start manufactur some of it chip atSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) at the expens of the company' longtim manufactur partner,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company(NYSE: TSM) .makeArticleAd();In thi column, I'd like to make the case that,even ifthi report is true and TSMC doe lose some NVIDIA order to it arch-rival, the loss isn't like to extend beyond a gener or so. Here' why.What happen beyond the 14/16-nanomet generation?Al of the chip that NVIDIA ha announc thu far base on it Pascal architectur (GP100, GP102, GP104, and GP106) are built on TSMC' 16-nanomet technology. It' not yet clear where the upcom GP107 and GP108 chip -- the two lowest-end product in the Pascal product stack -- will be manufactured, but if ani Pascal-bas chip will be manufactur by Samsung, these are the two like candidates.It' wide believ that NVIDIA' next-gener graphics-processor architecture, known as Volta, will also be manufactur in a 14/16-nanometer-manufactur technology. (Fudzillaand awell-known leakeronBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) both say 16-nanometer.)However, as I wrote in a recent article, it appear that, after the 14/16-nanomet generation, NVIDIA will not use a 10-nanomet chip-manufactur technolog and will, instead,skip directlyto a 7-nanomet technolog to build futur products.It' worth note that TSMC is expect to begin mass product of it 7-nanomet technolog in the first half of 2018. If we assum that NVIDIA follow it publicli state strategi of use a process after the major mobil player have built product on it for quit some time, then we could see the graphic specialist start use thi technolog in the first half of 2019.Interestingly, it look as though Samsung will stay on it 10-nanomet technolog for quit a bit longer than TSMC intend to. In an interview withEETimes, Samsung' Kelvin Low said that a transit to EUV lithographi ""i an import enabl for a 7-nanomet cost afford node."" Per the article, he also wa ""not readi to announc avail for 7-nanomet EUV.""Mi guess, then, is that if Samsung is bet on EUV for it 7-nanomet process, we probabl won't see it in mass product untilmaybe2019, or perhap even 2020. Further, given NVIDIA' strategi of not be the first user of a given technology, it would be some time after Samsung began initi volum product befor the graphic specialist would be like to use the technology.What' the bottom line?Mi view is that, even if Samsung win some NVIDIA busi in the 14/16-nanomet gener (and thi certainli remain to be seen), I don't think the relationship will last beyond a product cycl or two.TSMC look as though it will gain a signific technolog lead over Samsung start in 2018, which should allow it to reclaim ani busi that it lose at the 14/16-nanomet generation.

Wall Street is natur weigh in, albeit with wide vari view of what the new iPhon portend for the futur of Appl and AAPL shares.Source:Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified)First wa UB analystSteven Milunovich, who toldBarron'sthat iPhon growth is ""inevitable"" at some point in the future. Mr. Milunovich reason that despit an extend iPhon refresh cycle, Apple' huge instal base mean that at some point all these peopl will get tire of their jade iPhon handset and start rush to their nearest Appl store to buy themselv a shini new thing.makeArticleAd();On the opposit end of the spectrum is Stuart Frankel' Steve Grasso. Herec spoke on CNBC, where he issu a rather harsh indict of AAPL, say the compani is doom to ""underperform perpetually.""Mr. Grasso said Appl stock is no longer a risk asset (asset with high volatil such as growth stocks) and that AAPL ha onli benefit from everyon get push in the market. Grasso ad that he would sell Appl stock on ani short-term strength, such as the recent 13% ralli after the companydeliv better-than-fear Q3 earnings.In a nutshell, Grasso said Apple' glori day as a growth compani are over.7 Best Dividend Stock You Haven't Heard OfTh commentari touch a raw nerv becaus it came at time when Appl stock had been underperforming, with growth increasingli difficult to come by. Despit recent gain in AAPL stock, it' up a mere 4% year-to-d … and down 6% over the past 52 weeks.Perhap investor should not dismiss Mr. Grasso as just anoth soapboax who is out to spoil the party. After all, there' a solid chanc that the upcom iPhon might not perform accord to heighten expectations.New Growth Runway for Appl StockUnlik the case a few year ago, Appl is no longer the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Smartphon momentum ha been gradual shift from Cupertino to Seoul.Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) ha grown into a formid Appl competitor, with the Samsung S7/S7 Edg manag to edg out the iPhon 6s/6 with 16% of U.S. smartphon sale vs. 14.6%. Although Appl loyalti remain quit high, as mani as 5% of current iPhon user have indic their willing to defect to the Samsung camp when the next upgrad cycl come calling.But Appl is far from a basket case.Th short-term outlook for Appl stock is actuallygood. 2016 is shape up to be an annu horribili for Appl investor as iPhon sale are expect to tank in double-digit to below 200 million units, a brutal declin for a devic that ha manag to post uninterrupt growth for close to a decade.But that kind of drop will inevit set up easier comp for anoth year, even two. Indeed, Mr. Milunovich' estim of modest single-digit growth in iPhon sale in FY 2017 and as much as 20% growth in FY 2018 might actual be in the ballpark - due to abysm sale in the current year.And some of Apple' revenu segment remain in the pink of health. Apple' Servic segment that consist of Appl Music subscriptions, paid app from App Store, iTun Music and iCloud storage, among others, ha been do quit well. The segment grew 19% year-over-year last quarter to $5.98 billion, with App Store revenu grow 37%. The segment now contribut a fifth of Appl gross profits, and CEO Tim Cook say the segment could be ""the size of a Fortun 100 compani by next year.""Moreover, Appl still ha some promis project in the pipeline, includ Appl TV.

But the compani say it' will to wait and will eventu get it way.7 Stock the Smart Money Love … Or HatesFurther, Appl still retain a huge cash hoard that it can use to continu make strateg acquisitions. Indeed, CEO Tim Cook recent told Wall Street that Appl plan to up it M&A game, saying, ""In time when equiti valu are falling, there' great opportun to (buy companies).""I Appl Stock a Growth Play, Or a Valu Play?Thi is, of course, the million-dollar question. Growth stock tend to receiv significantli higher valuat multipl than valu stocks. Although Appl is still classifi as a growth stock by index provid such as FTSE Russel and S&P Dow Jones, the fact that Warren Buffet'sBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and value-ori mutual fund investor have been pile in suggest that Appl stock is increasingli show some valu characteristics.It might, however, be a year or more befor the indic are rebalanc and AAPL is final design a valu stock.Nevertheless, it' too earli to say that thi will happen with ani degre of certainty.

What InvenSense's CEO Had to Say About Pokemon Go;8/19/2016;"Imag source:Flickr/Shannon.Shar ofInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) shot up around 23% from the close on August 11 to close on August 15. Share were spur by a note from Pacif Crest analyst John Vinh upgrad the stock on the belief that the rise in popular ofPokemon Gowil spur sale of smartphon with high-end gyroscop in them, like the one InvenSens makes.In fact, investor who were pay attent dure InvenSense' earn call could'v gotten that news straight from the horse' mouth, so to speak. CEO Behrooz Abdi mention the opportun present by augment realiti app and specif brought upPokemon Go. That wa two week befor the Pacif Crest note.makeArticleAd();Here' exactli what Abdi had to say about Pokemon Go on InvenSense' first-quart earn call.Pokemon Goi just an exampleDur hi comments, Abdi told analyst ""new applic priorit raw sensor performance"" present a new growth opportun for the company. It' not just augment reality, but optic imag stabil and indoor navig app requir high-end gyroscop to function as well.Of course, Abdi couldn't resist point toPokemon Goa ""a perfect example"":Thi game ha achiev unpreced viral popular worldwide, but there have been numer report case of the user experi vari wide depend on the presenc of the high-perform gyroscop in the phone.Ultimately, Abdi believesPokemon Gowil lead to ""the emerg of mani more augment realiti applic and games,"" which will enabl it to get it product into more mid-tier and low-tier smartphones.InvenSens ha seen thi opportun for a long timeTh abil to penetr mid-tier and low-tier smartphon ha been part of InvenSense' long-term outlook on the industri for a long time. Augment and virtual realiti implement have been a big part of what wa (and still is) expect to drive the penetration.W didn't necessarili obvious forecast it or predict that someth likePokemon Gowa go to come along, but we alway felt that augment realiti wa go to come along at some point. And obvious the last few week have been a frenzi of inbound interest from the customers. [...] If you have a phone that' even a mid-tier phone that' not AR compatible, I think you'r go to get some question from consumers. [...] Which mean in that quarter or littl bit later, we should see a realli good traction in term of designs.In other words, Abdi expect that InvenSens will win more design in the current or upcom quarter for smartphon model that tradit didn't have a high-end gyroscope. He expect the market to expand quickly, and by next year, a lot more phone could have InvenSens gyro inside.Abdi ha long point to the big opportun in mobile.Back in 2014, he wa talk about how onli one in four mobil phone ha a gyroscop in it, leav it an opportun to get it product into the remain 1.5 billion phone in the world.Th competit is still loomingTh biggest threat to InvenSens is the grow presenc ofSTMicroelectronics(NYSE: STM) in the market. STMicro wa abl to grab the socket inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Appl Watch even though InvenSens manag to win the gyroscop in the iPhon 6, which wa releas just six month prior.STMicro ha been aggress move into InvenSense' turf, produc high-end six-axi sensor to take a larger share of Appl andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) flagship devices. The competitor took both the optic imag stabil socket and the standard six-axi gyro socket in Samsung' Galaxi S7 and S7 Edge.Samsung account for less than 10% of InvenSense' revenu dure it fiscal first quarter. A year ago, it account for 23% of revenue. The shift caus Apple' share of InvenSens revenu to climb to 46% from 38% despit a signific declin in iPhon sales.Th point is, InvenSens hasn't done a great job of defend it market share, and there' no guarante the expand market will benefit InvenSens much. That' especi true consid the current strength of STMicro, as well as smaller manufactur that may look to cater more toward the mid-tier to low-end price point necessari to penetr the rest of the market.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Intel Corporation Talks Chip Manufacturing Tech;8/18/2016;"Imag source: Intel.At it annual develop forum, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) disclos quit a lot of inform about it current and futur chip manufactur technologies, someth that wa sore need after a long stretch of essenti radio silence.makeArticleAd();Ther is a lot of ground to cover here as the present that the compani gave wa pack to the brim with goodies. Let' get to it.Say hello to 14+One topic that Intel talk about wa the develop of ""deriv technologies"" base on current manufactur technologies. These deriv technologies, accord to Intel, are ""becom more common to enhanc perform and/or expand featur set.""Th first such deriv technolog that Intel is announc (or, at the veri least, bother to brand for investors' sake) is 14+. Thi is a technolog that includ enhanc to both the transistor as well as the metal stack to yield a perform improv of 12%.Thi process is what the company' upcom Kabi Lake famili of processor as well as, I assume, the company' second gener of 14-nanomet server processor slate for launch in 2017, will be built on.Thre wave of 10-nanometerIntel say that there will be three wave of it futur 10-nanomet technology: 10, 10+, and 10++. These, the compani says, will ""support multipl new leading-edg products.""Thi mean that even though Intel will be ""stuck"" on it 10-nanomet technolog for three product generations, the compani should be abl to wring out addit manufacturing-rel perform enhanc on top of product-level architectur improvements.Intel claim signific densiti advantag over competitionOn metric that Intel ha talk quit a lot about is the logic area densiti of it manufactur technolog rel to compet technolog fromTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Corporation(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .The idea is that the more tightli a compani can pack transistor (what chip are made of), the more featur and function it can cram into a fix chip area.Here' the slide that Intel show compar it technolog with those from it competition:Imag source: Intel.Accord to the company, it 14-nanomet technolog -- use the metric of transistor gate pitch multipli by logic cell height -- is a littl less dens than competitors' upcom 10-nanomet manufactur technologies. Intel' own 10-nanomet technology, per thi comparison, will be dramat ahead of the competit in thi metric (though it' worth note that Intel' 10-nanomet technolog should come a bit later than the competitions').Although I believ that Intel will be abl to maintain a solid transistor densiti lead over Samsung, the competit pictur vis-à-vi TSMC is a littl less clear. Though it is true that Intel' 10-nanomet should be quit a bit denser than TSMC' 10-nanometer, TSMC ha indic that it will transit to it 7-nanomet technolog in the first half of 2018.TSMC claim that it 7-nanomet technolog will bring both perform and area enhanc rel to 10-nanometer, so I expect the gap, at the veri least with respect to transistor area, to narrow rel to Intel' 10-nanomet technology. Whether TSMC close the gap or not, remain to be seen.I suspect, though, that ani sustain advantag that Intel will be abl to build over TSMC won't necessarili be in term of transistor area but, instead, in transistor perform as the compani iter through it 10, 10+, and 10++ technologies.What doe thi mean for the business?At the end of the day, it' Intel' job to build compel product for the variou market that it serves. Yearli perform improv in manufactur technolog should allow the compani to releas better and faster product each year, allow it to gain share in new area (such as the Internet of Thing and networking) while defend it posit in area where it' alreadi strong (person computers, servers).A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Then last year, in an effort to appeal to profession user and combat slide iPad revenue, Appl introduc the more expens iPad Pro.Back to School 2016: The 5 Best Laptop for StudentsWith iPhon sale also face downward pressur and the challeng of convinc consum to buy into an increment upgrade, the idea of releas a premium-pr iPhon 7 Pro made sense.Th two distinctli differ iPhon 7 Plu shell photo fuel specul that Appl had chosen thi approach. The standard iPhon 7 Plu would be the expect increment refresh, as part of Apple' newthree-year releas cycle.

NVIDIA Corporation May Turn to Samsung for Graphics Chip Manufacturing;8/16/2016;"Imag source: NVIDIA.Graph specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) choseTaiwan Semiconductor Manufactur Company's(NYSE: TSM) 16-nanomet FinFET Plu manufactur technolog to build all of the Pascal-architectur graphic processor that it ha announc so far, which should compris the bulk of the company' multi-billion dollar game busi over the next sever quarters. NVIDIA also went to TSMC for it next-gener Tegra system-on-a-chip, a central compon of it small but grow automot chip business.makeArticleAd();But accord toChosun Biz, a South Korean newspap (viaReuters) NVIDIA will actual tapSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) to manufactur Pascal-architectur base graphic processor befor year-end.Though NVIDIA doesn't bring the kind of chip volum that, say, a smartphon processor compani does, it' still a key user of TSMC' leading-edg manufactur technologies.Consid that virtual all of NVIDIA' chip shipment (both stand-alon graphic processor as well as Tegra processors) will eventu move to these product lines, thi is a pretti big deal for TSMC. And dure NVIDIA' earn call in May, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang prais the Taiwan-bas contract chip manufacturer, call them the ""world' best manufactur of semiconductors.""So should investor take thi news at face value? Let' have a closer look.NVIDIA ha histori with 14-nanometerTher is some evid in the public domain that NVIDIA is look at a 14-nanomet manufactur process.Th onli two viabl 14-nanomet process in the industri today belong to Samsung andIntel. However, given Intel' inexperi as a contract chip manufactur (and shoddi track record -- see the signific delay Altera ha experienc with it Intel 14-nanomet Stratix 10 FPGA), I doubt that NVIDIA would be look to build chip at Intel anytim soon.So what evid is there? Well, take a look at thisLinkedInprofil of an NVIDIA senior physic design methodolog engineer:Imag source: Author screenshot of LinkedIn profile.Besid the exist position, there is also a current job open on NVIDIA' website:Imag credit: Author screenshot of NVIDIA website.A you can see, both posit specif distinguish between the 14 and 16-nanomet process as part of the job requirements. Sinc TSMC' technolog is known as 16-nanomet and Samsung' technolog is known as 14-nanometer, my guess is the compani ha actual follow through and develop non-trivi chip on both technologies.Wil NVIDIA actual make product from it 14-nanomet efforts?But just becaus NVIDIA (or realli ani fabless company) ha work on a particular process doesn't mean that the compani will necessarili bring product built on that process to market. After all, if one chip manufacturer' yield rate (that is, the ratio of good chip to the total chip produc from a given silicon wafer) are weak, or if one company' manufactur technolog simpli underperform (i.e., inferior transistor performance, power consumption, etc.), a chip design may choos to onli go into product with one contract manufacturer, even if it ha complet the work to build the chip on two companies' technologies.Th fact that NVIDIA engin appear to have work on a 14-nanomet process tell me that the compani may have actual design some product around thi process. Given that NVIDIA ha been pretti open about the fact that the Pascal-bas chip releas so far (GP100 for data centers, GP102/GP104/GP106 for gaming) have been built on TSMC' 16-nanometer, it' unlik we will see those product produc at Samsung as well.However, it' possibl that the two remain graphic processor that NVIDIA hasn't announc yet (the GP107 for low-end game and GP108 aim at PC OEMs) could either be built exclus at Samsung or dual sourc from both Samsung and TSMC -- the less riski and more like option.We'l know soonAnoth report from IT Home suggest that the GeForc GTX 1050, which I would expect to be base on the GP107 graphic processor to target budget price points, will hit the market in Octob of thi year.If NVIDIA say it is built on 16-nanometer, then that could throw the whole idea of dual-sourc for thi product out the window. However, if NVIDIA play coy about the manufactur technolog for the 1050 (perhap by simpli refer to it as made on a FinFET manufactur technology), then we'll know that it' either a 14-nanomet product -- and NVIDIA doesn't want to give the percept that it lower-end graphic processor are built on a ""superior"" technology, even though the name is meaningless -- or it is dual-sourced.Regardless, the impact for either TSMC and Samsung in the case that NVIDIA dual-sourc it upcom lower-end graphic chip (or outright move that busi to Samsung) will be minim -- certainli not someth that will realli have a signific financi impact on either chip manufactur giant.For NVIDIA, the main benefit from move some busi over to Samsung would be more favor pricing. Samsung is the underdog in the semiconductor foundri market, so I wouldn't be surpris if the compani were will to offer NVIDIA fairli low wafer prices. Additionally, if TSMC see that NVIDIA is seriou about it multi-sourc efforts, it may also be driven to lower it ask price in a bid to hold onto the vast major of NVIDIA' business.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Specifically, it let a user edit the tint of object and peopl photograph underwat without affect the tint of the water itself. The end result is the photograph is recogniz snap underwater.makeArticleAd();So whi would thi patent cover imag edit softwar be touch off iPhon 7 rumors?AsQuartz'sMik Murphi point out, if Appl is work on tool to ensur that underwat photo look great, then it' not a great leap to assum that the photo would be snap on an iPhone. And if an iPhon is snap photo underwater, it seem reason to also assum that AAPL will be make the iPhon 7 itself waterproof.Twitt Inc (TWTR): Don't Celebr Appl TV Talk YetNot water-resistant. The competingSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxi S7 is IP68 rate water-resistant, which is great for protect from rain and the smartphon can even surviv up to 30 minut in 5 feet of water.Y don't spend the time and money to develop special imag enhanc softwar for snap photo just below the surfac of a swim pool.Whi Appl Need to Go WaterproofAppl need someth to one-up Samsung' phone when the iPhon 7 is launched. Go beyond water resist to be actual waterproof would be a market coup. It would also end one of the biggest (and costliest) issu face current iPhon owners:wat damage.Could the iPhon 7 be the devic that get the waterproof treatment? While the patent wa just grant last week, Appl actual file in back in 2013. So the compani ha had plenti of time to work on the softwareandth design modif need to achiev a waterproof rating.In fact, a waterproof enclosur dovetail nice with one of the longest-run iPhon 7 rumors: that Appl is ditch the headphon jack. The space save in elimin thi standard port are minimal, though the headphon jack is one of the primari way water can enter the device.Elimin the headphon jack, and waterproof get a lot easier to achieve.Besid have a featur to beat Samsung on when it come to marketing, there clearli is consum demand for a waterproof iPhone.

Apple Inc. Reportedly Taps Taiwan Semiconductor for S2 Chip Manufacturing;8/9/2016;"Imag credit: Apple.It' well known thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) reli on it arch rival,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , to manufactur the processor insid it first-gener Appl Watch wearabl device. That chip wa built on a rel date 28-nanomet manufactur technology, which, for an extrem power-limit wearabl design, led to signific limit in term of performance.makeArticleAd();Accord to KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, via Digitimes, , the next-gener Appl Watch -- known as the Appl Watch 2 -- as well as a refresh variant of the current-gener Appl Watch will use a new applic processor manufactur inTaiwan Semiconductor's(NYSE: TSM) 16-nanomet process technology.A win for TSMCTSMC ha been talk about a variant of it 16-nanomet manufactur technolog known as 16FFC, target at low cost and low-pow applications. This, rather than the higher-perform 16-nanomet FinFET Plu technolog use to manufactur some of Apple' A9 processors, is what I'd bet Appl will use for the S2 processor.Although the market for smartwatch isn't as larg as some market research firm had predict it to be by now, oneestimatesay the iDevic maker ship 12 million Appl Watch in 2015. Thi is a multimillion-unit market, and if TSMC can consist nab the applic processor order for the Appl Watch, it'll repres a nice, though hardli game-changing, piec of increment revenue.And, perhap more importantli in the fierc competit semiconductor manufactur market, it'll mean less money flow into the Samsung foundry' coffers.A win for AppleTh first-gener Appl Watch applic processor wa quit slow, sport a single, rel slow CPU core and a fairli date graphic core from the company' longtim graphic processor supplier,Imagination(NASDAQOTH: IGNMF) .Bi transit to a variant of TSMC' 16-nanomet technology, Appl should have the transistor and power budget to build a much more power applic processor while keep power consumpt in check. I expect a move to a faster processor core -- though I would be surpris to see Appl adopt multipl core at thi stage of the game -- as well as to a beefier, more modern graphic processor.In a nutshell, the basic task for the next-gener Appl Watch -- as well as the refresh variant of the current one with the new processor -- should becomemuchfaster, and develop will have much more freedom to deliv excit new applications.It' the last part that' so importantAppl isn't the first compani to bring to market a smartwatch, but even as a late entrant, it ha manag to grow it share of the market, which it ha dramat expanded, to north of 50%, accord to Strategi Analytics.Right now Appl ha the distinct advantag of have an overwhelmingli domin market share. High market share mean develop will be more interest in target Apple' platform rather than compet platforms. More develop attent mean more and better softwar for Apple' platform rel to compet platforms, which help Appl to keep current Appl Watch user loyal to the platform and to entic first-tim smartwatch buyer to hop on to the Appl bandwagon.Also note that the Appl Watch current requir an iPhon to function, so the more that iPhon custom adopt and are satisfi with the Appl Watch, the potenti stronger Apple' iPhon share posit will be.Apple' job now is to keep push the watchO platform by both make softwar develop easi and give develop first-rat hardwar to target their app to. The applic processor insid the S2 system-in-packag should certainli help with the latter.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc. (AAPL): What We Think We Know About the iPhone 7;8/8/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIfAppl Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) follow it usual releas pattern - and there' no reason to believ it won't - we should be see the iPhon 7 in September.Source: SunnycTher have been a lot of iPhon 7 rumor float around over the past few months, but as the expect launch date approach and leak of cases, compon and even complet unit have begun to show up with increas frequency, we have a pretti good idea of what Appl ha in store.makeArticleAd();Here' a roundup of what we current think Appl will unveil when it show off it latest iPhon in just over a month.Form FactorIt look as though Appl will be stick with the same two-model releas strategi it initi with the iPhon 6 and 6 Plus. There had been talk of a third iPhon 7 Plu ""Pro"" model as well, but most bet are on a 4.6-inch iPhon 7 and 5.5-inch iPhon 7 Plus.7 No-Nam Tech Stock That Will Make You RichWith iPhon sale slow and Appl move to a three-year model refresh cycle, thi year' smartphon are expect to look veri much like the previou two generations.Leak photo have shown the antenna band move to the top and bottom of the case, the new version may be slightli thinner and imag have circul of a darker, near-black color option, but the iPhon 7 should look veri much like the iPhon 6 and 6s.iPhon 7 CameraOn of the big sell point for 2016 is expect to be the camera, especi the one Appl appear to be stick in the iPhon 7 Plus. Buyer who shell out for the more expens smartphon are expect to get a dual-len camera system for advanc photography.Thi could includ the abil to take much wider angl photos, or one of the lens may allow for a two to three time optic zoom. The dual-len system can be seen appear in mani iPhon 7 Plu cases, includ the one shown in the photo that arealreadi be offer for pre-ord by China' Sunnyc.Th iPhon 7 itself seem to be get an upgrad as well, with spi shot show a much larger camera lens.Goodby Headphon JackWhil the iPhon 7 camera is expect to gener upgrad interest, one factor that could cool consum demand is the headphon jack, or lack thereof. Rumor suggest that Appl is kill the headphon jack with the iPhon 7, instead reli on it Lightn port for audio output. That mean either includ new Lightn ear bud with the phone, or a Light to 3.5mm headphon jack adapt in the box.Lightn ear bud are a more eleg solution, but elimin the headphon jack mean million of headphon sold over mani decad are suddenli incompat with the iPhon 7 - without an adapter. Includ one in the box might quell some complaints, but there' no doubt mani peopl will be upset with thi move.Waterproof and Improv Batteri LifeWhi would Appl risk infuri million of music lover by ditch the long-tim industri standard headphon jack?It appear to have fallen victim to sever other features, primarili waterproofing. Appl seem intent on elimin everi possibl water entri point (includ the home button whichmaybecom a ""forc touch"" virtual version instead of a physic button) and that 3.5 mm headphon jack is a big entri point. While rivalSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) ha offer waterproof smartphon for years, the iPhon 7 would be an Appl first - and anoth big reason for current iPhon owner to upgrade.It' alsopossiblethat the iPhon 7 could featur the recent announcedGorilla Glass 5fromCorn Incorporated(NYSE:GLW). Corn say the new ultra-dur screen protect will be on devic start thi fall, and given that Appl ha use Gorilla Glass on iPhon in the past (although the relationship is kept low-key) it' possibl the iPhon 7 could be much more rug overal than previou Appl phones.Anoth bonu to elimin space taken up by that connector is more room for a battery, and the iPhon 7 is expect to get a bump in batteri life as a result.Mor StorageBesid lack of waterproofing, anoth area Appl get pick on is it insist of stick with 16GB as the base storag for it phones. That seem like a blatant rip-off these days, especi when featur like 4K video record gener huge files.TheWal Street Journalsay Appl will final relent thi year and theiPhon 7 will offer 32GB of storag in it base model. Some analyst expect the compani will also boost the maximum storag from the current 128GB to 256GB, for power users.Mor PowerfulEveri new gener of Appl devic get a spec bump and the one thing we can count on thi year is that the iPhon 7 will be power by a new A10 processor.Expect more speed, and improv efficiency. While the iPhon 7 is expect to remain at 2GB of RAM, process demand of the dual camera system of the iPhon 7 Plu could see it get bump to 3GB.Walmart Flail at the Internet With Jet.com BuyNaturally, Appl is mum on all the rumor and speculation, so we'll have to wait for confirm on the details. But with sever key upgrad high like -includ waterproof and a boost iPhon 7 camera- the demand for the Apple' new smartphon may be high enough to shake off itscurr sale slump.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace:Appl Inc.: iPhon SE Review (AAPL)Appl Inc.

Both quot refer to South Korean giant Samsung' past two edit of it flagship smartphones.Earli thi week, Samsung launch the latest edit of it Note smartphon lineup in a like attempt to extend it momentum ahead of what will probabl be the year' most highli anticip smartphon launch -- the Appl iPhon 7, expect to roll out in mid-September. Let' review whether Samsung' Note 7 seem up to the task.makeArticleAd();Not 7: Anoth great Samsung smartphoneSamsung opt to skip from last year' Note 5 straight to the Note 7 thi year, probabl in a bid to simplifi the product number across it Galaxi and Note high-end handset families.In term of famili resembl go, Samsung' Note 7 is someth like the fratern twin of the Galaxi S7 Edge, the devic that wa the subject of one of the introductori quotes. In fact, the Note 7 wa reportedli built use the same curv screen and Edg softwar that power the Edg S7.Imag source: Samsung.Th two devic also share the same 5-megapixel front-fac and 12-megapixel rear-fac cameras. The same powerhouseQualcommSnapdragon 820 processor also power them, though Samsung will purportedli use it own Exynos-brand processor in some geographies.Th Note 7 enjoy a slightli larger screen size over the Galaxi S7 Edg -- 5.7 inches, versu 5.5 -- though the differ will be neglig to the averag user. The Note 7 and Galaxi S7 also share the same waterproof exterior that Samsung implement to widespread praise.Th biggest differ between the two is the Note 7' S-Pen stylus. Though it appear to larg share the core function of the Note 5, the Note 7 doe come with a few new tricks, includ tap magnif and GIF-mak capabilities. The Note 7 also come with a new Iri scanner that allow user to unlock their phone complet hands-free.Pric is anoth key difference. Thank to some new featur and the ad compon cost of the S-Pen, the standard edit of the Note 7 retail at $849, wherea the Galaxi S7 start $100 cheaper at $749.Overall, the Note appear to be anoth great iter of Samsung' success smartphon lineup. So what doe thi do for the competit balanc ahead of Apple' iPhon 7 launch later thi year?Appl versu SamsungHead toward the holiday months, Samsung enjoy an edg over Appl with it smartphon lineup. The wild card is what surpris Appl could have up it sleeve.On downsid of Apple' histor size and scale -- particularli in regard to it iPhon business, it largest segment by far -- is that detail of it devic plan tend to leak more easili than in it day as a smaller, nimbler company. The consensu so far, bear in mind that they are just rumor at thi point, is that Apple' forthcom iPhon 7 will offer onli moder improv over it predecessor.Should that be the case, Samsung could steal some market share from Appl at the high end of the smartphon market. It will bear watch to see whether Apple' ironclad ecosystem can help insul it from Samsung' compel new devices.Appl reportedli ha a sweep iPhon redesign in the work for fall 2017, the device' 10th anniversary. Assum the rumor are correct, consum could opt to wait for thi potenti game-chang iPhon next year.Eith way, the competit balanc in the most profit part of the smartphon market appear tilt in Samsung' favor more than at ani other time in recent memory.

Better Buy: InvenSense vs. Intel;8/7/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.Y probabl alreadi knowInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) are veri differ companies.Intel built it $163 billion compani by domin the PC processor business, but infam miss the mobil segment. InvenSense, on the other hand, is worth just $615 million, and ha bet most of it futur on the mobil market with it microelectromechan system (MEMS).makeArticleAd();Intel miss the mobil boom, but InvenSens bet the farm on it. And neither of those path ha work out especi well for the companies.But onli Intel is bounc back, while InvenSens ha been left floundering.Diversif is the keyInvenSens earn 46% of it total revenu from it sale of gyroscop sensor it make forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) (InvenSens doesn't explicitli say Appl is it largest customer, but it' a bit of an open secret).When an iPhon user tilt their devic to play a game or move it to their ear and the display goe dark, that' InvenSense' motion-sens technolog at work. InvenSens ha made similar technolog forSamsung' high-end devic as well.InvenSense' sensor are some of the best in the business, but both Appl and Samsung have been abl to drive down the sell price of those sensor becaus of their massiv size. InvenSens gave up some price negoti in order to get it tech in the most popular smartphon in the world. It' paid dearli for it.InvenSens ha fail to offset price pressur with significantli more revenu in it other busi segments. As a result, it revenu have been plummeting. In fiscal Q1 2017, InvenSens report just $60.6 million in revenu -- a 43% drop year-over-year.It' not as if InvenSens doesn't see the problem. The company' managementsaid on the latest earn callthat it' look to the Internet of Thing (IoT), virtual realiti headsets, and lower-end smartphon to drive futur sale of it MEMS.It' alreadi start to gain traction, too. InvenSense' ""other"" revenu segment (which includ IoT) now account for 25% of the company' total revenue.But InvenSens is still too depend on Apple, and the compani can't match Intel' diversification.Onc Intel fulli realiz how big it problem of miss out on mobil was, it set a cours for the next big thing: the Internet of Things. IoT ha becom one of Intel' biggest focuses, and no one can accus the compani of fail to deliver.Ov the past few years, Intel ha either bought or partner with compani that make wearabl devices, connect smart cities, driverless cars, comput vision, and much more.Just last month, Intel partner withBMWandMobileyeto creat anopen, self-driv car platform for carmakers. The company' Atom and Xeon processor power the technology, along with Intel' cloud platform and machin learn systems.It' just one exampl of Intel diversifi away from PC and move toward the mind-boggl $7 trillion IoT market.It' not that Intel is make all that much from IoT revenue. It earn $572 million from the segment in Q2 2016, up just 2% year-over-year, and just a drop in the bucket compar to it total quarterli revenu of $13.5 billion.But the advantag that Intel ha over InvenSens is that it' much more diversifi across it IoT opportunities. Even it PC busi (still Intel' biggest money maker) is spread across mani major customers. InvenSense' fate is essenti tie to Appl and littl else.Thi isn't even closeInvenSense' loss mean that the compani doesn't have a posit P/E ratio right now. Meanwhile, Intel' P/E is just under 17, much lower than the technolog industri averag of 26. Intel isn't experienc skyrocket earn right now either, but it' at least diversifi itself far more than InvenSense.Intel is still work on it transit away from PCs, and not everyth is go smoothly. For instance, the compani just recal it Basi smartwatch becaus of overh problems.But compar to InvenSense, Intel look like a no-brainer. Intel' revenu aren't domin by just one major player; InvenSens can't say the same. And for that reason, I think Intel is a much better buy for investors.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Customers Aren't Upgrading Their Phones. Should Wireless Carriers Worry?;8/6/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.It' no secret that the smartphon upgrad cycl is get longer. Earlier thi year,Citigroupanalyst estim the smartphon upgrad cycl would extend to 29 month thi year, from a rang of 24 to 26 month two year ago.Th drive forc behind the extens is the shift in carrier from a subsidi model to equip instal plans. And the move is now start to cut into carriers' revenues.Verizon(NYSE: VZ) saw it equip revenu fall 4.1% last quarter, lead to it first quarterli revenu declin in over six years.AT&T(NYSE: T) ha seen it equip revenu fall three straight quarter as custom hold on to their smartphon longer.makeArticleAd();But while wireless carrier are see a declin in revenu in part becaus of declin equip sales, the lengthen smartphon upgrad cycl shouldn't worri investors.It' all about the bottom lineTh margin on smartphon sale are significantli wors than on carriers' wireless service. While carrier may receiv incent to sell phone from certain hardwar makers, the devic are gener sold at cost.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) pay salespeopl notori high commissions, which is whysal rep often recommend Samsung devic over other manufacturers. Still, those commiss don't amount to much in the grand scheme of things, and AT&T' and Verizon' margin on it wireless servic are much better.That' evidenc in the companies' wireless segment margins. Verizon' wireless busi saw it oper margin increas 2.9 percentag point year over year, and it EBITDA margin improv 3.6 percentag point in the most recent quarter. AT&T' consum mobil segment improv it oper margin a more modest 1.5 percentag points, and it EBITDA margin improv 2.2 percentag points.Th shift to separ servic and equip bill ha also lift servic margin at AT&T. Verizon doesn't break out servic margin. Both have seen servic revenu declin as a result of the shift as well.Verizon ha manag to continu increas it oper incom and EBITDA. The same can't be said of AT&T, but that' due more to high-valu postpaid phone subscrib loss than to an extens of the smartphon upgrad cycle.Verizon will face it first big test thi quarterOn Verizon' second-quart earn call, CFO Fran Shammo told investor he doesn't realli know what kind of impact equip instal plan will have on exist customers' decis to upgrad their phones. ""We have our first set of EIP custom come up on their two-year anniversary,"" he told analysts. ""And there' not enough volum yet of those custom to realli get a behavior track, if you will, whether they are go to hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they are just wait for a new phone.""H also note that the compani saw a similar trend in 2014 ahead ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon 6 launch, but it wasn't quit as ""dramatic."" There are report that Apple' upcom iPhon releas thi fall won't be a major upgrad like the iPhon 6, which may caus some iPhon custom to hold on to their devic even longer. Appl hold a 43.9% market share in the Unit States, and that percentag is like even higher for Verizon with it premium custom base.For what it' worth, AT&T saw it first round of EIP custom finish their first round of instal payment in the second quarter last year, when equip revenu stay flat. It improv margin in the third quarter befor fall nearli 21% in the fourth quarter. That may be partial due to the tough compar with the iPhon 6 releas in 2014, though. Oper incom continu to increas nonetheless.Investor should look close at Verizon' result in the third quarter. Verizon could report anoth revenu decline, but if it' mostli the result of custom who are hold on to their phone longer, it shouldn't be too much of a concern.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

But investor' should note that the compani is till vastli overdepend on one custom that account for 46% of revenu in the quarter. While InvenSens doesn't specifi who that is, it' wide believ it refer to Apple.InvenSens ha been expand it ""other"" revenu segment to help offset this, but it' clear that the transit is nowher near complete.Aug realiti could spur MEM salesTh compani said on the earn call that the popular augment realiti (AR) game,Pokemon Go, show that user are in need of high-qual gyroscop that can track smartphon movements.

Mani consum have complain about poor user experi withPokemon Goon handset with no gyro, or a sub-standard gyro performance.Abdi said the compani expect to see mani more AR game emerge, and that it will expand demand for higher-qu gyroscop in mid- and low-tier smartphones.Internet of Thing revenu continu to expandOn bright spot for InvenSens ha come from it expans into the Internet of Things, and it continu focu on new markets, like sensor for virtual-r headsets.

He went on to say that InvenSens just announc a motion-track devic that' design to meet the ""rigor perform demand of head-mount displays.""Abdi point to the 50% compound annual growth rate for VR as a way for the compani to expand it motion-sensor posit in new market beyond mobile.InvenSens want in on the expand automot marketInvenSense' manag believ there' opportun for the compani to sell motion and audio imag technolog for advanc driver-assist system (ADAS), which are the build block for self-driv cars.

Why Reports of a Samsung Deal Sent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Shares Soaring;8/3/2016;"FCA CEO Sergio Marchionn is reportedli on the verg of a deal with Samsung Electron that would put FCA $3 billion closer to an import goal. Imag source: Fiat Chrysler AutomobilesShar ofFiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) move sharpli higher on Wednesday after BloombergreportedthatSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is in ""advanc talks"" to buy some or all of FCA' Magneti Marelli auto part unit.makeArticleAd();At 1 p.m. EDT, FCA' share were trade at $6.63, up just over 9% from Tuesday' close.What we know about the potenti dealFirst, some background. Magneti Marelli is a major supplier of automot part and compon to FCA and other automakers. It focus larg on electron system and relat parts, includ lighting, in-car entertain systems, instrument cluster for dashboards, suspens components, and compon for connected-car systems. Marelli is a wholli own of FCA, but it appear that it' now for sale.Accord to the Bloomberg report, Samsung is particularli interest in Magneti Marelli' lighting, in-car entertainment, and ""telematics,"" or connected-car systems. It' possibl that Samsung will seek to buy onli those specif line of business.But Bloomberg' sources, identifi onli as ""peopl familiar with the matter,"" say that Samsung might be consid an outright purchas of Magneti Marelli. Such a deal ""could be worth more than $3 billion"" and could close by the end of the year, accord to the report.What' Magneti Marelli worth?It' hard to say for sure. But we know that Magneti Marelli earn 321 million euro befor interest and tax in 2015 on revenu of 7.26 billion euros. That work out to an EBIT margin of 4.5% -- rather thin, but up from just 3.5% in 2014.A back-of-the-envelop 10-times-EBIT give us a potenti valu of 3.21 billion euros. That' probabl on the rich side, but the Bloomberg report suggest that the negoti are in that neighborhood.Whi would Fiat Chrysler want to sell?Magneti Marelli' connect to Fiat goe all the way back to 1919, when the compani wa found as a joint ventur in which Fiat wa a partner. But here in 2016, it' easi to see whi FCA might want to sell: The boss is in a hurri to pay down debt.A of the end of the second quarter, FCA' debt exceed it cash by about 5.5 billion euros. CEO Sergio Marchionne' goal is to have FCA' cash exceed it debt by 4 billion euro by the time he retir in 2019, like in hope of make the compani more attract to a potenti acquirer.A we'v seen, Marelli is profitable, but it' a low-margin business. If Marchionn can realli get $3 billion or more for it, it' a good deal.Whi would Samsung want to buy?It' no secret that Samsung would like to diversifi away from consum electronics. With the rapid technolog chang come to the auto industry, it' a no-brain that Samsung might want to follow the lead of rival likeLG Chem,Nvidia, andBlackBerry, each of which ha establish or expand signific automot line of busi in recent years.Samsung alreadi doe busi with FCA. Among other things, it suppli the batteri for the electr version of the Fiat 500. That relationship is expect to expand as FCA add more electr vehicl to it portfolio. Acquir Magneti Marelli would greatli expand Samsung' presenc and clout in the auto industry.There' also a person connection. Samsung famili heir (and vice chairman) Jae Yong Lee is on the board of director ofExor, a compani that serv as the invest vehicl for the descend of Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli. There' a direct connect to Marchionne: In addit to hi duti at FCA, Marchionn is vice chairman of Exor.Th upshot: The deal make senseThere' a reason that FCA' share jump on the news: At anyth close to the rumor price, it would be a good deal for the automaker. On the other side, acquir Marelli would instantli give giant Samsung a signific presenc as a global auto supplier, posit it well to be a player in the industry' rapid technolog evolution.Long stori short: The deal seem to make a lot of sense. We'll see if it happens.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

"What to Expect As Universal Display Continues Its ""Year of Building""";8/3/2016;"Imag source: Univers Display.Univers Display Corporation(NASDAQ: OLED) is set to releas second-quart 2016 result thi Thursday after the market close. With share of the OLE specialist up more than 30% year to date and sit near an all-tim high as of thi writing, now' a great time for investor to start think about what to expect.makeArticleAd();First, note Univers Display hasn't provid specif quarterli financi guidance. So for perspect -- and with the caveat that we don't pay much attent to Wall Street' short-term demand -- analysts' consensu estim predict the compani will report 18.2% year-over-year growth in revenue, to $68.7 million, and a 22% increas in earn per share, to $0.50.To be fair, that might seem like a big jump fromlast quarter, when Univers Display saw revenu declin 4.8% year over year to $29.7 million, which translat to net incom of $1.9 million, or $0.04 per share. But keep in mind the second quarter will includ revenu from Univers Display' long-term licens agreement withSamsungDisplay, under which it recogn bi-annu payment receiv in Q2 and Q4 of each year. Togeth in 2016, those two payment will total $75 million, up from $60 million in 2015.To that end, listen for Univers Display to break down itsothersignific sourc of revenu in materi sales. For example, while royalti and licens fee outsid of the Samsung agreement increas 20.5% year over year last quarter, to $5.3 million, materi sale simultan declin 9% year over year, to $24.3 million.However, that declin also isn't indic of a lack of demand for Univers Display' OLE materials. Dure the subsequ confer call, manag point out that materi buy pattern can vari significantli from quarter to quarter in these earli stage of growth. And even so, sale of Univers Display' patent phosphoresc emitt materi climb 8% year over year. And the declin wa primarili due to neglig sale dure the quarter of host materials, as compar to $4.4 million in host materi revenu in last year' second quarter. Remember, unlik it lucr emitters, UDC custom arenotrequir to purchas host materi from the compani sinc they aren't cover under it massiv portfolio of over 3,600 issu and pend OLED-centr patents.To that end, I'll also be listen close for more detail surround Univers Display' 87 million euro acquisit of 500 issu and pend OLE patent from BASF, as well as it $36 million acquisit of contract research organ (CRO) Adesi last quarter.I'm particularli curiou about the latter. Adesis, accord to Univers Display, work close as a partner in the few year prior to the acquisit help to ""advanc and acceler a number of Univers Display' product offerings."" And go forward, Adesis' team of 40 chemist will obvious help advanc it initi and widen the company' alreadi formid IP moat.But as Ipoint outa littl over a month ago, Adesi also serv multipl other end market includ pharma, biotech, and catalysis, and reportedli gener annual revenu in the ten of million last year. Moreover, Adesi presid Andrew Cotton indic that, in addit to support Univers Display' OLE ambitions, hi compani anticip benefit from Univers Display' ""financi and busi acumen to better support our client [...] and reinforc our posit for continu growth as a specialti chemic CRO.""It will be interest to see, then, what kind of increment financi contribut Adesi is expect to provid from these supplement market as it oper as a subsidiari of Univers Display.Next, keep your ear open for updat on royalti paid by Univers Display' second-largest customer,LG Display(NYSE: LPL) . Recal that LG Display pay run royalti on sale of licens product with a one-quart lag. So, I wa somewhat surpris last quarter by the lack of a signific step up in licens and royalti revenu consid LG Display previous confirm that roughli 50% of it OLE TV unit shipment last year were sold in the fourth quarter. However, dure the Q&A portion of last quarter' confer call, Univers Display CFO Sid Rosenblatt indic those report sale are from product LG display sell toLG Electronics, which mean royalti may be paid with ""differ time than when LG Electron report their sale.""In ani case, royalti from LG Display should continu to increas as the compani ramp product of OLE TV go forward (from 400,000 unit ship last year to a target of one million in 2016). But even in these earli stages, it would be nice to get a better pictur of LG Display' financi contribut to Univers Display' top and bottom lines.Next, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the big catalyst so mani credit for Univers Display' recent gains:Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Namely, the increas number of report indic Appl is plan to expand it use of OLE from ""just"" the Appl Watch to it other iDevices, start with it iPhones. That' not to say I expect Univers Display to directli confirm thi transition, but consid Rosenblatt himselfcaus Univers Display share to risel last year after assert he think it' ""onli a matter of time"" befor Appl put OLE into it iPhones, you won't find OLE investor complain if he inadvert drop hint about Cupertino' plans.Finally, listen for ani chang to Univers Display' full-year guidance, which current call for 2016 revenu growth of 15%, plu or minu 5%, equat to a rang of $208.7 million to $230.6 million. Again, we'r still in the earli inning of growth for the OLE industry, and Rosenblatt last quarter remind investor that they ""expect 2016 to be a year of building"" as variou OEM invest billion to bolster their OLE manufactur capabilities. Still, given the short-term-ori natur of our market, ani chang to Univers Display' guidanc thi year could influenc the direct of it stock as impati investor wait for that growth stori to unfold.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Samsung Leapfrogs over GoPro Inc. in the VR Camera Race;8/3/2016;"GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) CEO Nick Woodman believ virtual realiti is a huge growth opportun for hi company. Dure a confer call in May, Woodman claim GoPro had ""an opportun to be a leader in consum VR"" while discuss the company' VR filmmak rig and VR app.Woodman declar that by combin the six-camera Omni, 16-camera Odyssey, and Kolor, the company' stitch software, GoPro had ""creat one of the world' most comprehens platform for capturing, stitching, share and enjoy VR content."" Unfortunately, that platform is also extrem expens -- the Omni cost $5,000 and the Odyssey cost $15,000. Woodman mention develop a ""more casual"" spheric camera for mainstream consumersback in January, but the compani hasn't reveal such a devic yet.makeArticleAd();Ent Samsung' Gear 360. Imag source: Samsung.That' whereSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) come in. The company' new Gear 360 camera is a spheric devic that weigh about the same as GoPro' Hero 4 Black, but use two ultrawid fishey lens to captur 360-degre imag and videos. It' an eleg solut which make GoPro' pricey rig look clumsi and outdated. The Gear 360 cost just $350, which make it $150 cheaper than the Hero 4 Black.However, the Gear 360 onli work with Samsung phones, and it video qualiti obvious can't match the profession grade video of GoPro' multi-camera rigs. But if GoPro still plan to launch a ""casual"" spheric camera for the masses, Samsung might have rais the bar well beyond GoPro' reach.Th busi of 360-degre camerasSamsung isn't the first compani to launch a 360-degre camera. Other notabl devic includ the Kodak PixPro SP360 4K Action Cam ($450), 360Fli ($400), and the Ricoh Theta S ($350). The 360-degre video from these devic can be view onAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTub or insid a VR headset.GoPro and YouTub previous co-develop the Odyssey for the Jump platform, which deliv profession qualiti 360-degre video to YouTube. GoPro often cite that partnership as proof that it would becom a major player in the VR market. However, YouTub also recent extendedthat partnershiptoYi Technology, which sell camera with the same technolog as GoPro' high-end devic for about half the price.GoPro' Omni (L) and Odyssey (R) rigs. Imag source: GoPro.YouTube' embrac of cheaper 360-degre and action camera rig indic that it want mainstream user to upload more VR video to the site. That would make YouTub a top site for VR videos, and widen it moat againstFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) News Feed video and Oculu VR.Whi hasn't GoPro launch a spheric camera?YouTube' strategi conflict with GoPro' strategi of use Omni and Odyssey to sell more cameras. GoPro realiz that YouTube' embrac of cheaper VR camera could dilut it brand appeal, so it launch it own VR site and app, GoPro VR, in April. But as I mention in aprevi article, that strategi didn't make sense, sinc more stream video viewer like start on YouTub instead of GoPro' websit or app.Th key problem with GoPro' strategi is that they all revolv around sell more action cameras. It VR rig are realli just accessories, and the Karma drone will like be afli accessoryto move more GoPro cameras. That' probabl whi GoPro ha been reluct to launch a spheric devic like the Gear 360 -- it would like cannib sale of it action camera and rigs.Th flaw in that strategi is that compani are integr camera into these product at lower price tags. Samsung' Gear 360 and Xiaomi's4K Mi Dronear both cheaper than the Hero 4 Black, which rais question about whi consum would buy GoPro' action camera and VR/drone accessori separ for higher prices. Unless GoPro abandon it accessori strategi and focus on creat competit stand-alon devic with integr cameras, it will like struggl to remain competit in new market like VR and drones.Samsung leapfrog GoPro in VR techUnlik GoPro, Samsung now ha a cohes platform for captur and view VR video. The Gear 360 clearli complement the Gear VR headset, which Piper Jaffray expect to outsel all other VR headset thi year with 5 million unit sold. The combin of the two devic could yield some impress result if content from the Gear 360 is directli stream to the Gear VR.GoPro' VR app and rig aren't seamlessli link with each other. It recent teas some footag from a smaller VR camera, but the devic seem to be acustom deviceus GoPro camera instead of a mainstream product. GoPro hasn't lost the VR race yet, but it must releas more head-turn devic to prevent custom from ditch their GoPro for newer camera like the Gear 360.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Found Success With the iPhone SE;8/2/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Ev sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) launch the iPhon SE in March, the 4-inch smartphon ha been the center of a lot of questions. Would it boost iPhon sales? Would it cut into sale of higher-pr iPhon units? Would it convert Android users?With Apple' fiscal third-quart earn releas in late Juli we got some answers. Despit data suggest that the iPhon SE is cannib the iPhon 6s and 6s Plu in the U.S. and isn't produc mani Android switchers, Appl suggest the global stori is different. Additionally, it appear the smaller form factor help Appl sell more iPhon than analyst had expected.makeArticleAd();Appl sold 40.4 million iPhon unit last quarter, versu analyst estim of 39.9 million units. The averag unit price fell to $595, down from $660 in the third quarter last year and below the consensu estim of $612. That indic that the iPhon SE is a success.Said CEO Tim Cook in the company' confer call: ""At it launch, we said that the addit of the iPhon SE to the iPhon lineup place us in a better posit to meet the need of custom who love a 4-inch phone and to attract even more custom into our ecosystem. In both cases, that strategi is working.""What is a success for the iPhon SE?Th iPhon SE fill a hole in Apple' product lineup on the low end -- that is, Apple' low end. It' price lower than Appl had been price it 2-year-old model, but it bring the capabl of the iPhon 6s, which play toward Apple' servic busi (e.g. Appl Pay). Ultimately, the iPhon SE is about bring more custom into Apple' ecosystem and feed it servic business. Do that would qualifi it as a success.Said Appl CFO Luca Maestri in the confer call: ""... we believ that the SE is do exactli what it wa intended, which is we are see a higher rate of new to iPhon customers, which is obvious veri import to us as we bring new peopl into the iO ecosystem.""Th iPhon SE wa also intend to open the wallet of exist Appl custom who hadn't upgrad their devic in over two years, so that they could more easili access Apple' newest services. That appear to have happened, accord to a recentCIRP survey. The research firm found that 33% of iPhon SE buyer were upgrad from an older iPhone, includ some model date back to 2011 and earlier. That compar with just 17% of purchas of the newest model and 12% of buyer of last year' iPhones. Cook told investor on the earn call that the new model is ""convinc some peopl to upgrad that want a smaller form factor but want to stay with iPhone.""Furthermore, it provid a better entri point for first-tim smartphon buyers. Indeed, the CIRP survey indic a significantli larger percentag of iPhon SE buyer were first-tim smartphon owners. That wa sentiment wa perhap echo in Cook' prepar comment on the earn call: ""We ad million of first-tim smartphon buyer in the June quarter.""Finally, the iPhon SE is price to attract custom look for a phone price in the midrange, between $200 and $500. Previously, those custom could either buy a 2-year-old iPhon or an Android model. Most opt for the latter. So a high switch rate would indic that the iPhon SE is succeeding.Th CIRP survey indic a smaller percentag of iPhon SE custom were switch from Android compar with the larger-screen model in the Unit States. On the earn call, Cook note that ""the percentag of iPhon SE sale go to custom who are new to iPhon is greater than we'v seen in the first week of avail for other iPhon launch in the last sever years."" While that includ first-tim smartphon buyers, Cook ad that ""switcher account for the highest percentag of quarterli iPhon sale we'v ever measured.""What about cannibalization?Th biggest concern for investor is that the iPhon SE is too good -- that custom who might have bought a higher-pr iPhon will opt for the low-end SE. That' what the CIRP survey suggests, however, Maestri told analysts, ""We have not seen clear evid of cannib from iPhon 6s or 6s Plus."" But then he qualifi that statement: ""Of course, there' alway go to be some level of cannibalization, but realli to us what is much more relev is the much bigger opportun to bring more peopl into the iO ecosystem.""Do you thinkSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) worri about whether it lower-end smartphon are cut into sale of it flagship Galaxi devices?

3 Reasons the Virtual Reality Revolution Might Be Delayed;8/1/2016;"Imag source: Facebook.makeArticleAd();Virtu realiti headset fromHTC(NASDAQOTH: HTCXF) andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) have been avail for sever month now. Unfortunately, the latest data suggest that neither HTC' Vive nor Facebook' Rift will match 2016 sale estimates. Here are three possibl reason for the disappoint reception.Th price problemHigh price are the biggest barrier to VR adopt -- the Vive sell for $799, while the Oculu Rift is price at $599.Sony(NYSE: SNE) will debut it PlayStat VR headset thi Octob at $399, repres a lower-cost option for those with a PlayStat 4 console. But for those who do not alreadi own a PS4, that still put the price north of $700.Alternatively, theSamsungGear VR, which run on the Oculu platform, ha a $99 price tag, present a rel low entri cost for peopl with newer phones. As with other low-cost headset options, however, it isn't compat with mani game and app due to hardwar limitations.Must-hav softwar isn't there yetTh VR game and app ecosystem lack flesh out experi and anyth that could be describ as a ""killer app."" Potenti use for virtual realiti extend beyond video games, but interact entertain is the main hook for earli adopters, and most of the earli softwar ha more in common with tech demo than triple-A titles.Smal user base for VR platform mean that develop have less incent to creat the type of big-budget experi that might be the key to sell thi medium. Develop also have to contend with the fact that virtual realiti is not standardized, with signific differ between platform potenti shrink address market or limit design.Rend virtual realiti world is also resourc intens and requir some trade-off to deliv immersion. At least part of the reason for thi is that the number of frame render per second ha to be veri high to creat a seamless experience; oscil in frame rate, as well as other visual quirks, can be disori for the user. The substanti process power devot to run in VR limit overal graphic fidelity, so while experi are more immersive, they also take backward step in some aspects.Aug realiti is steal the spotlightWith Facebook, HTC, Sony, and other bring VR headset to market in 2016, it' surpris to see augment realiti off to a much bigger start thi year thank toNintendo' massiv popularPokemon Go. The game' incred success is like send develop scrambl to get in on what could be the next big thing, and the AR push could divert attent and develop resourc away from VR.While virtual realiti offer new avenu for data collect and ad delivery, augment realiti like ha even greater data gather potential, as well as a profound abil to direct foot traffic to commerc centers. With both technolog still in their earli stages, AR seem to offer a real world social compon that' a better fit with the current mobile-centr softwar market. Virtual realiti ha greater immers potential, but it also bring an element of isolation, and the medium current lack a breakthrough game or app to get peopl hook and invest in the technology.At least in the short term, augment realiti seem to have captur the public imagin and interest in a way that VR ha not -- and price, sociability, and the presenc of a killer app seem to be core aspect of that progression.VR should take hold with timeTh combin factor of price, hardwar and softwar limitations, and the emerg popular of augment realiti present inhibit factor for earli VR adoption, but the technolog will improv and it potenti better realiz with time.Major advanc for the tech and it softwar ecosystem will like play out over the next five-year period and should reduc mani of the exist barrier to widespread adoption.

These 2 Smartphone Companies Could Be About to Call It Quits;8/1/2016;"Getti Images.In what seem imposs a few year ago, it now appear that the smartphon industri ha met it matur moment. The smartphon industri is rapidli cooling. IDC now expect worldwid smartphon shipment growth to slow to 3.1% thi year, down from the torrid 27.8% growth rate the industri produc in 2014.makeArticleAd();Smartphon giantAppleha now report it second-consecut quarter of year-on-year iPhon shipment declines. Lead Android handset makerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) ha produc errat perform as it attempt to compet with Appl in the high-end markets, and other Android maker in the lower-cost develop markets.A hallmark of a matur and declin market is the shakeout, where weaker particip leav the industry. IfMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) andSony(NYSE: SNE) are ani indication, the smartphon industri may be in the initi phase of a shakeout.Smartphon are no longer a point of emphasi for SonyTech websiteTh Vergereport how quickli Soni ha pivot away from smartphones. In Sony' recent report first fiscal quarter, the compani report a slim profit in smartphon of $4 million versu loss in prior quarters. However, Soni accomplish thi rare profit not by sell more phones; it wa mostli accomplish on cost cut in the division.Th Verg note the compani onli sold 3.1 million smartphon in the quarter versu 7.2 million in the compar quarter. As a result, mobile-divis revenu drop 34%. In fiscal 2016, the compani expect to sell onli 19 million handsets, and appear to be posit itself to no longer grow market share in smartphones, but mere to servic exist demand.Microsoft continu to cut from it Nokia DivisionNew Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella continu to dismantl former CEO Steve Ballmer' decis to buyNokia' smartphon business. Last year, the compani took a $7.5 billion writedown -- essenti the entir purchas price -- and announc 7,800 job cuts, most in the mobil business.Then in May, the compani took further step away from phone manufacturing. First, Microsoft later agre to sell it feature-phon (read: non-smartphone) business, includ 4,500 employees, to Foxconn, for $350 million. A week later, the compani announc approxim 1,850 job cuts, most relat to the smartphon business.It appear that Nadella wasn't finish cut employe from Microsoft' payroll. A new report from Bloomberg state Microsoft is elimin an addit 2,850 job in fiscal 2017. Between these aforement transactions, the compani will have shed nearli 17,000 employees, or nearli 70% of the 25,000 it gain through the Nokia purchase. The vast major of these employe were in it mobil division.It' import to note that both Microsoft and Soni are still technic in the smartphon business. However, their action are more in line with compani look to exit the industri versu compani look to compet and expand their market share.A mix bag for Appl and SamsungFor market leader Appl and Samsung, a mature, slow market is sort of a mix bag. As seen above, a slow market tend to depress competit as compani exit the busi altogether, or stop activ invest in research and development. These two factor allow stronger compani to consolid remain market demand while potenti spend less themselv on research and development.On the other hand, slow demand in a matur industri requir increas market share in order to continu grow at a level investor are accustom to.

Apple May Be Able to Open Stores in India After All;7/31/2016;"Imag Source: AppleIndia' govern andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have had an on-again, off-again relationship recently. After CEO Tim Cook visit the countri in May, the Foreign Invest Promot Board rule that Appl doesn't qualifi for exempt from the 30% local sourc rule for ""cutting-edg technology"" compani that want to open single-brand retail store in the country.But last week, Prime Minist Narendra Modi' cabinet reportedli approv a three-year exempt on the local sourc requir for compani want to open single-brand retail locat that sell ""cutting-edg technology,"" accord toBloomberg. At the same time, the plan is to make it easier for compani like Appl to qualifi for the exemption.makeArticleAd();Th news that the cabinet is on board with thi loosen of rule open the door for Appl to open up store in one of the last remain major growth opportun for it iPhon line.Get it own placeAppl is current requir to sell it product in India through re-sel and in it store-within-a-stor locations. Those format prevent Appl from control the retail experi the way it doe with it store in other countries.Apple' store are a key part of the company' overal strategy. Not onli do they extend and advertis the Appl brand, but the locat provid a customer-servic center for Appl devic owners. Appl Store employe are qualifi to answer custom question and help fix issu with devices. While re-sel can provid advic as well, Appl Store employe undergo extens train to help custom get the most out of their devic (and upsel custom to more expens devic while they'r at it).Additionally, open up it own retail locat could allow Appl to offer a financ plan as it doe in the Unit State with the iPhon Upgrad program. That would make it easier for Indian consum to afford the premium-pr iPhones. Even the new low-pric iPhon SE cost approxim $584 in India becaus of tariff and other taxes.Th major of smartphon sold in India cost less than $120, with the averag sale price just $70, accord to research fromGartner. With Apple' least expens model significantli more costly, provid a superior custom experi through it own retail locat would go a long way toward justifi it pricing.A big growth opportunityIndia remain the market with the biggest growth opportunity. It' the second most popul countri in the world after China, but while Chines consum purchas around 438 million smartphon last year, Indian bought just over 100 million.Meanwhile, featur phone remain popular in the country. Sale of featur phone total 167 million in India in 2015, accord to Gartner, make up 61 percent of total mobil phone sale in the country. That repres a huge market of potenti smartphon buyer go forward.Th Indian market ha been domin bySamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , which took an estim 26.6% of the market in the first quarter of the year. The compani cater it smartphon to certain emerg markets. In India, Samsung market it J-Seri of Galaxi smartphon that retail for between $200 and $250.India is where China wa about five year ago, right befor it start grow exponenti and overtook the U.S. as the largest smartphon market. In 2012, Appl gener $22.5 billion revenu in Greater China after experienc 78% growth year over year. Last year, the compani gener $58.7 billion in the region. Appl increas it store count in the countri from six store at the begin of fiscal 2012 to 36 today and it plan to have 40 by the end of the year.Appl is experienc strong growth in India, similar to China in 2012 and 2015. In the first quarter, sale increas 76%, and they grew 56% in it second quarter. Appl is grab share from Samsung on the high end of the market, just as it did in China. Appl doesn't break out India' sales.Establish more retail locat could spur further growth as it extend the brand and increas the valu of it products. With a pathway clear for Appl to open it own store in the country, it could spur anoth round of growth for Appl after see it sale contract thi year.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Qualcomm, Inc.;7/30/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) andMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) tend to appeal to similar set of investors. Both microchip specialist tap directli into the mobil comput market, and their product are often found side by side in the same electron gadgets.makeArticleAd();But those similar are onli skin deep. Dig a littl bit deeper, and you'll find that the compani actual serv veri distinct end-us markets, and the busi model could hardli be more different. In the end, investor who like one of these stock probabl aren't interest in the other one at all.Here' what I mean.Target marketsMicron work in one clearli defin sector. The compani make memori chip of variou types, and it product can be found in everyth from smartphon and tablet to PC system and big-iron servers.Wher there' comput power, you'll find memori chips. Micron is part of an exclus group of elit suppliers, where onli three compani can claim more than 15% of the global DRAM chip market. The compani hold substanti price power thank to thi unbalanc market structure.Qualcomm run a veri differ ship. The compani focus on high-spe wireless commun tools. 64% of last year' sale came from CDMA and LTE chip sales, and the rest from licens agreement around Qualcomm' massiv war chest of wireless technolog patents. We'r talk about a leader in it chosen field, as Qualcomm hold a domin 65% global market share in LTE baseband products, but the company' own client have start whip up their own wireless solutions.That' just scratch the surfac of the deep separ between Qualcomm and Micron. Micron run it own chip-manufactur factories, wherea Qualcomm reli on third-parti chip foundri instead. Qualcomm' financi health follow the fairli calm swing of the global market for wireless connectivity, while Micron' sale curv sometim get caught in price war withSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . If you'r into chart analysis, these two compani look noth alike:MUdata byYCharts.Bi the numbersBi most metrics, Qualcomm will look like a superior invest to the casual observer.Qualcomm sport $6.4 billion if trail free cash flows. Over the same period, Micron instead burn $2.4 billion of cash.Micron' sales, margins, and incom vari wildli over time. Qualcomm' are more stabl and sane.Som of Micron' profit metric occasion dip into red ink, make it more difficult to run simpl valuat tool on the stock. Qualcomm rare follow suit.It add up to a safer bet on a more predict business. Heck, Qualcomm even pay a quarterli dividend, yield 3.4% at today' prices. It' the riski technolog stock for investor who normal don't touch riski technolog stocks.That' all fine, but it' not my person style of investing. I have a real-money stake in Micron, but none in Qualcomm, becaus the memori maker is drastic undervalued.Micron' chosen field of busi happen to be extrem cyclical. As mention above, Samsung sometim start price war over DRAM and NAND memori chips, feed low-cost compon into it own consum electron oper for a few quarters. When thi happens, Micron stumbles. But Micron ha a cushi cash balanc to fall back on, and it' like to pick up a few of it die rival on the cheap as they go bankrupt.So, you can pick up Micron share when time are hard and the stock look cheap, like now. Then Samsung lay off the memory-chip price war again, the cycl turns, and Micron investor pocket some seriou cash. When thi exact scenario play out between 2012 and 2014, Micron' share price increas more than sixfold in 24 months.And now we'r back to a tough street price environ and low, low Micron share prices.Th compani is valu at just 1.2 time book value, mean investor would bare break even if Micron stop do busi and liquid all of it asset today. Qualcomm' price-to-book ratio stand at 3.0, and that' still low in comparison to mani other semiconductor giants.It' the same stori if you look at enterpris valu over EBITDA profits, price to sales, and other measur against fundament financi health. Micron is price for total disaster, but it actual remain pois to deliv the good onc thi downturn passes.That' my invest thesi for Micron, and I expect to be handsom reward in one to three years. On that time scale, the safer Qualcomm bet seem unlik to beat my chosen champion.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

1 Investing Lesson to Take Away From InvenSense's Fall;7/29/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.If you don't have time to read thi entir article, rememb thi old adag and you'll get the gist of what you should know: Don't put all of your egg in one basket (or even two). The lesson ofInvenSense's(NYSE: INVN) fall are a bit more complic than that, of course, but not by much.Th last few year have been quit a ride for InvenSens investors. The compani hit a high of about $22 per share in 2012, and then surpass that in Juli of 2014 befor start it precipit fall. It now sit around $7 per share. In percentag terms, the stock price ha fallen nearli 73% from it high in 2014.makeArticleAd();InvenSense' main busi is in sell motion-sens compon for mobil devices. These gyroscop sensor are the technolog that allow your phone to know when it' be tilt a certain way (so you can play games), or to turn the touchscreen display off when you rais your phone to your ear.Th compani ha special in those motion sensor (and a few other technologies) and becam the key supplier of thi technolog to bothApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Here' where thing start to fall apart for InvenSense. In order to gain the busi of those two mobil giants, InvenSens sold it motion sensor at lower cost than it should have, put a strain on margins.What exactli doe that mean?Think for a minut about how inexpens most product are atWal-Mart. The maker of those product sell their good to Wal-Mart at cheaper price than they would elsewher becaus of the company' massiv reach.That' good for custom becaus they get product at a cheaper price, and it' good for Wal-Mart becaus it' get good at discount price that custom want. But it can end up hurt the product maker becaus their profit margin are lower becaus they'v discount the price in order to reach a broad consum market.Sometim that work out for the product makers, and sometim it doesn't. Wal-Mart put the squeez on it supplier is a well-known practice, but you can appli the same idea to Appl and Samsung squeez InvenSense' sensor prices.Tak a look at thi chart show the steep declin of InvenSense' oper and profit margin over the past few years:Imag source:YCharts.Appl and Samsung were abl to demand low compon price that have crush InvenSense' margins. It' easi to assum Appl and Samsung are the bad guy in thi story. But of course, they function like ani other compani (or person) and don't want to overpay for anything. And that' whi we need to look at InvenSense' exposur to these compani as well as the price pressures.InvenSens made the mistak of get in the situat of receiv about 53% of it total revenu from just Appl and Samsung. The compani ha overexpos itself to these tech giant for sever years, and onli now is it start to remedi that by focus onoth revenu segments.Unfortunately, the damag ha alreadi been done.Th takeawayInvenSense' problem aren't unique. Plenti of other smaller compani face the same predica when suppli larg compani with products. At first, it seem like a massiv opportun to make compon for a big company. But if price aren't abl to significantli increas over time, or the supplier is unabl to balanc it exposur to major player with other revenues, then it quickli becom a major problem.InvenSens ha suffer from over exposur to Appl and Samsung, who also put intens pressur on the company' margins. Savvi investor would be wise to take those lesson to heart when evalu invest in small companies.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Consid IH predict these applic will boast more than 50% compound annual growth rate over the next sever years, InvenSens is wise posit itself to capit on anoth promis market.On a segment basis, smartphon and tablet shipment compris 63% of total revenu dure the quarter, up sequenti from 54% in fiscal Q4. Optic imag stabil (OIS) repres around 12% of sales, down from 14% last quarter. And InvenSense' ""Other Bucket,"" which notabl includ Internet of Thing (IoT) applic like drones, VR, wearables, and smart homes, wa 25% of revenu thi quarter, down from 32% last quarter.Of course, the shift back toward the sluggish mobil market might not seem favor for InvenSense, especi as it work to diversifi with design win in other markets. Dure the subsequ confer call, however, InvenSens CFO Mark Denting note that shipment into the IoT/oth bucket space, in particular, tend to be much heavier in the company' fiscal fourth quarter. As such, Denting says, we should see IoT-rel shipment ""bounc back in term of absolut dollars"" in the come quarters.In the meantime, InvenSens had one custom individu repres 46% of total revenu -- almost certainlyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) base on the geograph breakdown below -- with no other custom repres more than 10% of revenu dure the quarter.

And contribut from custom in the ""rest of world"" categori remain steadi on a sequenti basi at 3%.Finally, for the current quarter (fiscal 2017 Q2), InvenSens expect revenu in the rang of $77 million to $83 million, adjust gross margin between 45.5% and 46.5%, and adjust net incom per share in the rang of $0.02 to $0.04. By comparison, and though we don't typic pay much attent to Wall Street' near-term demands, analysts' consensu estim predict roughli the same per-shar earn on revenu near the low end of InvenSense' guidanc at $78.6 million.Whil some investor may have hope for more, there were no big surpris in what ultim appear to be a slightli better-than-expect perform from InvenSens thi quarter.

Why the Apple Inc. iPhone 6SE Won't Be a Thing;7/25/2016;"Imag source: Apple.A report recent surfac claim thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) may call it next-gener iPhone, wide believ to be call the iPhon 7, the ""iPhon 6SE.""makeArticleAd();Here' whi thi report, which come from Apfelpage.d (via 9to5Mac), seem unlik to be true.A market nightmareTh iPhon 6s didn't perform particularli well in the marketplace. Dure it cycle, Appl ha seemingli lost market segment share to it rival and saw it first-ev declin in iPhon unit and revenu shipment year over year.Appl blame the year-over-year declin essenti on tough comparison to the prior cycle, but that alon doesn't explain the market share loss. Clearly, Apple' market team fail to determin what features/technolog would be requir to keep pace in the marketplace.If Appl were to name it next-gener iPhon famili the iPhon 6SE, thi would send a pretti neg messag to consumers. In particular, it would say to them that thi new iPhon isn't much of an improv over the prior-gener iPhon 6s series, potenti lead to mute upgrad activity.In fact, with a name like the iPhon 6SE, not onli would iPhon 6s owner be hard-press to upgrade, but averag iPhon 6 user -- like folk who don't follow the nitty-gritti detail of each iPhon launch -- might think that the latest phone isn't much improv over what they alreadi have.That' not exactli the messag that Appl can afford to send to custom with the come product cycl -- at least not if it want to have a reason shot at stabilizing/grow iPhon revenu after a rough fiscal year.Anoth reason that thi name would be disastrousApple' chief rival in mani respect isSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . The iPhon and iPhon Plu model gener compet with Samsung' Galaxi S/Galaxi S Edge/Galaxi Note famili of products.Unlik Apple, which ha introduc ""new number"" phone in one year and ""s"" variant of those phone in the next, the Galaxi S phone seri see ""new numbers"" each year. In 2016, Samsung releas the Galaxi S7, Galaxi S7 Edge, and is on track to releas the Galaxi Note 7 (skip the Galaxi Note 6 entirely).If Appl were to releas the iPhon 6SE thi year, not onli would Apple' fall releas be behind in number rel to Samsung' latest (thi may seem trivial, but marketing/percept is quit important), but Samsung would pull further ahead with the spring launch of the Galaxi S8.Applereallywouldn't have a good time tri to market an ""iPhon 6SE"" against a ""Galaxi S8.""iPhon 7s much more like than iPhon 6SE thi yearA Iarguedin a previou column, it could be in Apple' best interest to call the next-gener iPhon the iPhon 7s rather than mere the iPhon 7. Such a name scheme would allow Appl to play up the improv in go from the iPhon 6s to the next phone.Th follow iPhon could be call the iPhon 8 and then go forward, the compani could elimin the ""s"" model altogether, instead move to new number from that point on.

Visa, PayPal And The Future Of Payments;7/25/2016;"ByKaren Webster:There' no doubt that the announc of the Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL)partnershipshook the payment world more than a littl bit last Thursday.Ov the last year, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman made a point, everi chanc he could, to let everyon know that he wa the chief of a decidedli differentPayPal, post it eBay (EBAY) independence. That PayPal, he said, wa one that embrac partnership and consum choice. The network that start life steer consum to ACH, he emphasized, wa now indiffer to tender type. The consum ruled.Ov that same year, Visa CEO Charli Scharf made it perfectli clear that player in the payment sphere fell into two distinct camps: they were either with Visa or against it. Frenemy, schenemi he as much said - thi co-opetit stuff doesn't reflect the realiti of how the payment ecosystem and the issuer-centr network model that ha been the cornerston of the payment industri for more than 50 year operates. And sinc PayPal' ACH model wa still aliv and well - with a chunk of account transact that way - Scharf made it clear that PayPal' busi model wa a concern.makeArticleAd();So, what gener the collect industri gasp last Thursday wa the public affirm that those two player had buri that hatchet.But, like most ani big announc in payment - and thi realli juici one - it ha led to mani differ interpretations.Som immedi remark that the partnership will give in-stor NFC payment a real boost. Analyst have express concern that it will total crater PayPal' busi model (an opinion that saw it stock take more than a 9 percent hit on Friday - it end the day down 6.75 percent). And some of the more sinist soothsay suggest that Visa now ha the benefit of have PayPal under it watch eye as it simultan scale it own digit competitor, Checkout.Al thing that make for nice headlin and clicks, but they are observ that are also somewhat off base.They all miss the potenti that both Visa and PayPal have to use the next 12 month of exclus of their multi-year relationship to chang the dynam of the payment landscap in the U.S., and the action of everi singl player in it.If they can execute.So, here' my take on what thi partnership is - and isn't.IT' NOT ABOUT NFCOne thing' for certain: when NFC is the hammer, everi in-stor payment announc is a nail.Yes, the deal with Visa and it access to Visa' token services, VDEP, is big. At the jump, it give PayPal an easi and immedi on-ramp as a token requestor to enabl contactless in-stor payment where Visa contactless payment are accept and Visa method of payment are used.A a refresher, VDEP elimin the bilater contractu rigmarol that make it hard for other contactless payment scheme that requir those individu contractu negoti to achiev commerci scale. It also set out paramet for how token requestor and issuer will play together, includ rule that forbid token requestor from impos fees. Thi partnership give issuer the chanc to opt in to becom a digitized, token credenti in a consumer' PayPal account for use in-stor under that program. And opt-in is a whole lot easier and faster than negoti commerci terms.Instead of get bog down in negoti the Ts and Cs of a commerci agreement, the work between the issuer and PayPal is about enabl account holder to use their Visa card in the PayPal account. Thing like who own what data (the data for ani PayPal/Visa transact will be share exactli as if a Visa card wa present and swiped), how Visa account will be posit at signup (equal posit with ACH options) and when transact (visibl and digit card credenti in the transact flow) ha alreadi been negotiated. Merchant also will probabl get favor price as part of thi deal, too, becaus PayPal get negoti econom incent which will pass along in part - more on that later.And, yes, while VDEP sure doe give PayPal the abil to check the in-stor payment box and allow it app and Visa issuer who opt-in to have pariti with the other in-stor ""Pays"" at those place that accept NFC payments, there are a coupl of big ""buts"" that offer some big clue into where in-stor may be head with thi partnership.""But"" No. 1 is that VDEP, at the moment, onli extend to PayPal app run on Android phones. So that limit the in-stor capabl to the unknown number of Visa credenti PayPal account holder who own Android phone capabl of make an NFC payment who also walk into merchant locat with NFC. And while that number may be unknown, it' probabl small and mayb even too small to get peopl all fire up about.Which bring me to ""but"" No. 2.Of the 2 million merchant locat that are NFC-enabled, 400k or so are vend machines. Accord to Visa' latest EMV stats, there are still 72 percent of merchant without EMV termin - and that mean there are still 72 percent of merchant that aren't equip to enabl NFC anytim soon. There' also no guarante that 100 percent of the 1.2 million EMV termin also are NFC enabl and at the place that consum shop regularli enough to develop a digit in-stor mobil payment habit.It is therefor unlik that either parti perceiv the Visa/PayP VDEP capabl as the in-stor NFC payments' silver bullet even though it wa a nice bullet in the presser. For digit payment to play at scale and ignite, the solut must be cloud-based, cross platform/cross OS and cross-channel. I think just about everyon know thi now - or at least I hope so.Mor likely, VDEP is the tip of veri big digit payment iceberg that could transform in-stor payment in a materi way.When I chat with Visa'sGlob EVP and Head of Innov last year, Jim McCarthy, at the launch of VDEP, he mention that VDEP wa technolog agnostic. In fact, he said that Visa' token servic ""give the merchant the abil to choos whether at the point of sale the consum present a QR code or an NFC radio signal or a BLE beacon-en transaction, becaus VDEP is agnost in that respect.""Now that' interesting.PayP ownsPaydiant, which ha it own portfolio of in-stor payment technologies. And Braintree, which ha put in market what Schulman describ as the most ""rapidli adopt product in PayPal history"" - One Touch. VDEP' technology-agnostic, effici issuer integr platform would seem to give the folk at PayPal and Visa the opportun to fine tune a slick, in-stor custom experi that goe well beyond sub a tap for a swipe to unlock new valu for merchant and consumers.That' where I'm place my bets.IT' ABOUT THE TRANSACT VOLUMEInvestor did not like it when PayPal CFO John Rainey suggest that 2017 would deliv increas transact expens as a result of chang to it fund mix. PayPal' stock price end Friday (Juli 22) down more than 6 percent, recov a bit from be down more than 9 percent earlier in the day.I, though, focus on three other comment that I believ round out the story: the tail end of Rainey' comment on transact costs, a veri point phrase that Schulman emphas sever time in hi own remark and Scharf' own descript of the deal terms.Rainey spoke of gain ""certainti over cost control,"" Schulman said the deal with Visa elimin the ""threat of ani target price actions"" and Scharf remark that the deal afford PayPal ""greater longer term fee certainty.""Taken together, thi suggest that absent a deal, PayPal might have been face oner cost-sid increas of anoth kind that could have had a materi impact on the business. Elimin that uncertainti via thi partnership mean that everyon can get on with the busi of busi - grow the digit payment footprint for consumers, issuer and merchants.Which is all about increas transact volume.Although detail are scant, as one might expect, both Schulman and Scharf acknowledg dure the earn call that econom incent are be extend to PayPal in exchang for increas volume.Ther are a few way that the partnership is design to drive transact volume.Ther is a 12-month exclus period for Visa issuer to promot their own, brand digit credenti within the PayPal account. I would imagin that issuer would jump at that chanc to ride the ""top of digit wallet"" with the largest digit payment player in the market, worldwide. I can also imagin that such effort might be accompani by some creativ market initi to drive account enrol and usag - with mayb Visa even kick in a few buck of it own. And sinc PayPal is accept at more than 14 million merchants, all of these consum incent actual give consum the opportun to use those digit account credenti at the place they like to shop around the digit ecosystem. And give PayPal the chanc to drive usag from 29 transact to someth that' more like onc a day.Thos market activ also will be link to a few thing also stipul as part of the agreement: PayPal agre to posit Visa equal with ACH account option at signup, incorpor digit imag of Visa card into the payment flow so they are promin featur as the top of wallet option, and work with issuer to help convert PayPal' Visa ACH custom to Visa debit custom should the consum wish to make the switch.It' that last part that ha everyon worried, but mayb it shouldn't.W don't realli know - and PayPal doe not disclos - how much of it volum in the U.S. is ACH-driven. PayPal suggest that it' not as straightforward a calculation, given the mix of P2P volum insid of it numbers. So, we don't realli know how much of the PayPal volum is realli a target for the switch - but it' obvious enough to have Visa concerned.But whatev that number is, now, thank to Durbin (and it' rare that we ever say ""thank to Durbin"") that revenu hit won't be as huge as it onc might have been. There' a gap between ACH and debit, of course, but it isn't as wide as the day befor Durbin. The size of that gap depend on those negoti incent that PayPal and Visa have work out and what PayPal pay for ACH today.But what I take away from the ""econom incentives"" narr is that both side will work togeth to do someth that should have been bake into everi precedingmobil payment ignitionscheme: give issuer - and by default consum - incent to activ digit account and use them. TPV - total payment volum - after all, is the name of the game.A volum game, play by meet and serv consum across everi channel and everi payment use case they encounter.IT' ABOUT DEBITOn aspect of the announc that I think got lost in the in-stor and no more tender-st news is the addit value-add that thi relationship bring to PayPal' P2P user and Visa' debit business.And the pretti big hole that it blew in the set of initi that bank are - and have been - undertak to make P2P a ubiquit realiti via it own schemes.Venmo users, who sent $4 billion between peopl in Q2, can now get instant access to that money if they use a Visa debit product. Thi instant access of fund also is avail to PayPal P2P users.Thi doe a few thing for Visa and PayPal/Venmo.First, it provid a huge incent for PayPal/Venmo user to attach their Visa card to their accounts.Second, it provid Visa issuer with a new opportun to market real-tim avail of fund via thi P2P capabl and use it as a way to acquir and retain debit card users. Sinc millenni are Venmo' prime demographic, thi could becom crucial to compet for the millenni demograph that issuer so covet - ad even more deposit account to the mix for issuer and P2P volum for PayPal/Venmo.Third, it elimin the friction and uncertainti issuer have with their current bank-driven P2P initiatives. Ubiqu is what' need to realli put teeth into P2P and make it a friction-fre experience. That doesn't exist today with ani of the schemes. Visa debit rail plu Venmo and PayPal can get pretti darn close.That mean that, fourth, thi capabl also open up a potenti whole new seri of use case for real-tim payment between peopl and between busi and peopl - from pay insur claims, to pay contract or gig workers, to disburs royalti use those rails.Thos same use case that the faster payment folk have been advoc that bank invest in expens new set of rail to support.IT COULD BE ABOUT A NEW WHOLE DIGIT PAYMENT PARADIGMTh one unansw question for most payment peep is where Visa Checkout now sit in the midst of thi announcement. Visa Checkout wa launch just about two year ago - in Juli 2014 - as the replac for V.me. Checkout shift Visa' focu from a wallet that aggreg a varieti of digit payment artifact to just make checkout onlin simpl and fast.When ask about Checkout on the earn call, Scharf said that Visa Checkout is chug right along, although he declin to offer stat on user and merchants. Thelast time Visa report Checkout numbers- March 2016 - it stood at 11 million user across 16 countri and more than 250k merchants. Scharf spoke instead to the enhanc to Checkout - a streamlin user experi and new way for issuer to be brand insid the app.There' a short-term and a long-term way of look at Checkout' futur vis-a-vi the Visa/PayP partnership.If I'm a Visa issuer and what I realli want is volum on my card and sticki digit transact customers, I'm go to want to be present in a varieti of digit checkout scenario as long as I don't have to do much to get there.But what I'm go to probabl do dure the next 12 month of exclus with PayPal, though, is blast out a seri of incent that get consum use card with the digit network that' alreadi accept wide onlin and in-app and veri like cook up a cool cloud-bas in-stor experience. If volum is what I want onlin and use of my own brand digit credenti in that channel, thi is probabl one of my best shot at achiev that.And if I'm Visa, I'm also go to use those next 12 month to mayb even fast-track get digit Visa credenti in as mani place as PayPal and Braintre and Venmo and Xoom can get them.Us all of those next 12 month to mobil a digit payment plan that put some distanc between Visa, it issuer and what everyon els is pursuing.So that, long term, Visa and PayPal could be well-posit to rewir the digit payment ecosystem.Mayb that' by use the combin asset of the Visa cardhold base and 188 million PayPal account holder to help merchant capit on the digit payment experi in way that have not been explor before.Mayb that' by tap the Braintre payment vein deepli includ the clever applic of capabl like Braintre Auth, which allow permission-bas share of token across eCommerc endpoints, to expand accept and usage.Or by use the econom incent that both side have spoken about to extend favor term to merchant and incent to cardhold to select and use Visa account on PayPal' digit network.Or realli think deepli about how to improv the shop experi by bank intellig into the consumer' digit account in order to further drive adoption, usag and prefer across all channels, platform and devices.Mayb even posit PayPal as a digit layer that connect digit issuer-brand credenti with ani platform, ani shop channel and ani devic enabl at those variou endpoints.WHO' CHOMP AT THE BIT AND SHAKe IN THEIR SHOES?Your reaction, of course, depend entir on where you play and what asset you bring to the digit payment party.Thre day is a rel short amount of time to absorb thi news and 12 month a rel short amount of time to execute, although as both side point out, it is a ""multi-year"" partnership agreement.If you'r one of the ""Pay"" players, it remain in Visa' and PayPal' interest to make their product attract to everyon so that consum choic can realli be delivered. But both of them also have made a decis to alloc their own resourc - time, peopl and money - to make sure that the partnership live up to the term of the deal and maxim the 12-month exclus for Visa issuers.Thos who could hurt the most besid the mani smaller ""Pay"" player who will struggl to get ani merchant attent now? Appl Pay (AAPL) and Samsung Pay (SSNLF).Appl Pay- sinc issuer will be given an incent to put their muscl behind a scheme that' more wide accept and use across a varieti of shop channels. And Samsung Pay given it veri narrow user potenti (just Android, then just Samsung, then just new Samsung devices) despit have a pretti slick technology. Like Appl Pay, they are devic and OS depend but unlik Appl Pay, they have a much smaller and seemingli less attract user base to offer merchants.Googl (GOOG) (GOOGL), on the other hand, could make for a veri interest partner if it take off it Android Pay hat and put on it Googl Commerc hats. I can imagin lot of clever scenario in which a Visa/PayP and Googl mash-up could drive volum to Google' variou commerc platforms, includ YouTube, Map and Search.Chas (JPMorgan Chase (JPM)) will be an interest one to watch. As one of Visa' largest issuers, it should be thrill and veri motiv to provid top of digit wallet statu to it PayPal users. As Chase Pay, the new mobil wallet ""Pay"" to be launch later, it might face some new and unanticip competit from the newli combin PayPal/Visa capabl in-stor and onlin - depend on how each partner take that part of their offer to market.American Express (AXP) and Discov (DFS) - well, they'v been pretti invis in the digit world so far and thi partnership ha the potenti to make that invis even more so. It also put tremend pressur on both of them to make a move, which could even includ an acquisit of some kind or to put themselv in play to be acquired, depending.MasterCard (MA), of course, made an announc of it own last weekwhen they acquiredU.K. payment system VocaLink.Th onc bank-own system that' a domin player in the U.K. payment market and enabl real-time/fast payment in multipl countries, includ a contract to do the same here in the U.S. with The Clear House, is a way for MasterCard to extend consum choic via it own payment network through direct debit access. While mani have suggest that MasterCard and VocaLink is simpli a way for MasterCard to beef up it base in the U.K. where Visa is alreadi quit strong, I think there may be more to it than that.When put alongsid it newli enhanc MasterPass cross-channel, cross-platform and cross-devic strategi unveil two week ago, I think that it' a signal that MasterCard is look to oper a global set of real-tim rail that move money between peopl and busi use ani payment tender across ani connect endpoint. The now have assembl network asset - they now need merchant and consum to hop on board.And that' what' so interest to me about Visa and PayPal. They each bring network asset and consum to the party. Visa, as the largest card network in the world, bring 14k FI and the consum they have in tow. PayPal, as the largest digit payment network in the world, bring 188 million activ user who'v develop a habit of use PayPal - and are increas that usage. PayPal also bring lot more ""dormant"" PayPal account that thi partnership could ""wake up"" with new incent for account holder to use them. They also have digit merchant accept and an engin that can enabl a lot of new technolog deploy on top of a power Visa and their network assets.But as I said earlier, everyth alway look good on paper. The hard part now is execution. That is what will decid whether thi is the sizzl that it appear to be or anoth great announc whose best day were behind it the day the press releas dropped.Se alsoBaebi Is An FDA Attent Seekeron seekingalpha.com"

Apple's Rivals Just Made Rumors of Absent Headphone Jack Stronger;7/23/2016;"Imag source: Motorola.Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) next iPhon is like to ship with a faster processor and better camera, two featur that should help the Cupertino tech giant remain on top of an increasingli competit smartphon market. Yet the phone may be defin more by what it lack than what it offers.Appl is wide expect to ditch the 3.5mm headphon jack in favor of Bluetooth and lightning-bas audio on the next iPhone. The move will be controversial. The 3.5mm port is tri and true, and almost everi set of headphon current in exist make use of it. Consum who upgrad to the latest iPhon may also need to upgrad their headphones, or make use of a cumbersom dongle.makeArticleAd();But Apple' competitor have alreadi beaten it to the punch. Lenovo' forthcom flagship, the Moto Z, ha no headphon port. It goe on sale later thi month, mani week befor the next iPhone, and could provid some sens of the backlash a headphon port-less iPhon will generate.A USB-C dongl in everi boxAt first glance, the Moto Z look like a pretti typic Android flagship. There' a 5.5-inch display, speedi Snapdragon 820 processor, and plenti of RAM. It ha some interest features, most notabl support for swappable, modular backplates, but the one thing it doesn't have is a 3.5mm headphon port. It ha a singl USB-C port locat on it lower side. That port is use to charg the device, but it can also send out an audio signal.Includ with everi Moto Z is a small USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter. Bundl it with the phone is a consumer-friendli move, but it' not a perfect solution: Moto Z owner who wish to use tradit headphon will have one extra cord to worri about -- one more thing to carri around, one more thing to lose. And even with the adapter, the situat isn't perfect: You can't charg the phone and listen to headphon at the same time. Ultimately, some may find the burden too much and opt for a differ handset entirely.In general, review haven't been overli impress with the Moto Z, but they haven't written it off entirely, either. Most of the critic ha stem from it excess price tag, mediocr camera, and Motorola' poor track record of deliv time softwar updates, with it miss headphon jack serv onli as a modest knock on the devic rather than an outright dealbreaker.""Th Moto Z...ha some good thing go for it, but unfortunately...it ha just as mani in the averag category...y get an averag camera, averag batteri life, [and] a phone that isn't that much fun to hold,"" wroteDroid Life' Kellex. ""It' not as polish or sculpt a phone asSamsung' Galaxi S7. Nor is it camera as good. Nor is it waterproof. Nor doe it have a headphon jack...th [Galaxi S7] is probabl a better phone,"" wroteWired' David Pierce.I Appl about to make a mistake?Bluetooth audio ha improv tremend in recent years, and Bluetooth headphon can now be had for as littl as $20. Unfortunately, Bluetooth headphon have their own intern batteries, which mean their owner need to rememb to recharg them. They also have to be pair and unpaired, which can be a confusing, and at time difficult, process. But the upsid is just as significant: There' no cord to get in the way.In the U.S., the Moto Z will (at least initially) be restrict toVerizon, launch as the latest instal in the long-run DROID seri of phones. That will restrict it market to Verizon subscribers. Moreover, Motorola ha -- for mani year -- been a third-tier smartphone-maker, with it U.S. market share hover around a modest 5% (compar to upward of 40% for Apple).That will make compar the rel success of the Moto Z with that of the iPhon difficult. Still, it exist should benefit Apple. If Appl doe ditch the 3.5mm port, it won't be alone. Other Android OEM could follow Motorola, and in time, consum could come to view the 3.5mm as a relic of the past. Bluetooth headphon should enjoy rise popularity, and increas ubiquity, make the prospect of a headphon jack-less iPhon far more palatable.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Last quarter, the compani saw it revenu declin for the first time in 13 years, of cours in tune with declin iPhon shipment and lower sell prices.W expect the to-be-report quarter to be a weak one for the company, given the persist sluggish in key region like China. Furthermore, SamsungSSNLFcontinu to gain traction in the smartphon market, which doe not bode well for Apple. Moreover, the recent PC shipment data from IDC and Gartner indic sluggish demand for Mac devic as well. The compani is entangl in a few lawsuits, which will weigh on it financials. For instance, Appl will have to dish out $400 million for the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit with regard to price fix of e-books.Nonetheless, some respit is expect from it newer enterpris collabor like SAP SESAPand increas traction in market like India. Also, some other notabl develop in the third quarter are Apple' chang to it App Store, which also includ differenti price for app develop base on their subscript term. Also, some other growth driver to watch out for are revenu from the greater Appl ecosystem and it other servic like Appl Pay and Appl Music. However, there is no deni that soft demand for iPhon ha an impact on it other offerings.Appl had earlier given a mute outlook for third quarter sales, cite uncertain macroeconom conditions. The compani expect third-quart revenu in the rang of $41 billion to $43 billion.Earn Whispers?Our proven model doe not conclus show that Appl will beat earn estim thi season.

Near a 4-Year Low, Is InvenSense Inc a Buy?;7/20/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.Th Internet of Thing (IoT) -- a world where all of our electron devic can commun with one anoth -- wa suppos to be the Next Big Thing. In a way, it is -- but the result for investor who hop on the IoT train have been noth short of disappointing.makeArticleAd();Consid what' happen toInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) sinc mid-2014.INVNdata byYCharts.InvenSens is actual near an all-tim low sinc go public in 2011. Below, we'll evalu whi the compani ha fallen, what it prospect look like go forward, and what kind of deal we'd be get on share today.Whi ha InvenSens so fallen out of favor?Here' the short answer for whi InvenSens hasn't pan out as an investment: (1) it reli far too much on a few custom for it business, and (2) it ha yet to realli becom an IoT company. Instead, it motion sensor technolog remain the domin sourc of income.Dur the company' last fiscal year,Apple(Nasdaq: AAPL) account for 40% of net revenue, whileSamsung(Nasdaqoth: SSNLF) chip in 16%. That' bad for two reasons. First, if someon at either of these compani decid to pick a differ provid of motion-sensor chips, it would spell doom for InvenSense. While InvenSens ha the advantag of deep relationship with both companies, if the technolog the compani provid is commoditized, Appl or Samsung will choos the cheaper, good-enough provid in a heartbeat.Furthermore, even if InvenSens remain in good grace with these two, a weak smartphon market-particularli in the high-end market-would asymmetr affect InvenSense. Currently, the company' fate is larg tie to trend in the smartphon market.InvenSens is tri to do someth about that-particularli by look for opportun in the Internet of Things. Manag qualifi all thing IoT relat as part of the company' ""IoT & Other"" division. As you can see, it still make up a small part of the revenu pie.Creat column chartsOf cours the growth of IoT over the past year-clock in at 115%-i veri encouraging. Manag said thi wa due to,""increas adopt and expans of a rang of consum electron product in...th IoT market .""But the fact of the matter is that it still account for just 20% of all revenue. And that need to chang to make thi a more compel investment.What doe the futur look like for InvenSense?Ov the medium-term, the compani will still be heavili influenc by smartphon and tablet sales. There' simpli no way around that. If Apple' next gen phone-lik tab the iPhon 7-i a success, it would be an import win for InvenSense.But even then, it will be crucial for investor to watch gross margins. Appl is (in)fam for squeez supplier for all they are worth, and InvenSens is no exception. In fiscal 2014 , gross margin stood at 49.4%. But over the last twelv months, they have shrunk to 41.6%. While manag see margin improv to the mid-40% range, such action should give investor paus that InvenSense' technolog is becom commoditized.Ov the long-run, the continu move into IoT is paramount. While no singl opportun in IoT will be as larg as InvenSense' tie-up with Appl and Samsung, if the compani can use it FireFli platform diversifi it base of customers, it would make the compani far less sensit to the smartphon market.Manag see possibl in a number of industries-includ drones, virtual reality, augment reality, automotive, wearabl and other applications-but success in ani of those is far from a guarantee.I it worth it at these prices?Technically, InvenSens is run in the red right now. But if we back out some one-tim payment and stock-bas compensation, the compani made $0.50 per share. It also brought in $75 million in free cash flow (FCF). Given this, it trade for a fairli reason 13 time earn and 8 time FCF.But that' not the whole story. The compani is onli expect to earn (non-GAAP) $0.12 per share in the come year, and that equat to a much higher forward P/E of 53.While there' no doubt that InvenSense' stock is cheap right now, I would caution to say that it' a buy. The company' path to success-keep margin stabl and grow while expand IoT offerings-i pretti clearli defined, the risk of commodit and lose out to well-heel rival is huge, and there' not much that give me confid that InvenSens will be a clear winner.I think investor would be better off find other place for their hard-earn cash.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

However, it appear that there wa the possibl that the A11 would besplitbetween Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, as had been the case with the A9 processor found insid of the iPhon 6s/6 Plus.Taiwan Semiconductor, it would seem, wa success in get all of Apple' A11 orders.Thi actual isn'ttoosurpris in light of comment from TSMC on the company' recent earn call. Manag said that it expect to have ""more than 70%"" market share at the 10-nanomet node in 2017, someth that impli at least major share of the A11 orders, if not outright exclusivity.At ani rate, if TSMC ha won the A11 in it entirety, then the chip manufactur won't have to worri about tough year-over-year comparison from late 2017 through late 2018. In fact, sinc both A10 and A11 are said to be TSMC-exclusive, TSMC should actual benefit dure the iPhon 8 cycl as it will have the order for the chip that go into both the flagship iPhon as well as the discount prior-gener model.Impl for Samsung foundrySamsung manag to grab a lot of headlin earlier thi year as it began talk up it own 10-nanomet technology. Although I expect Samsung' foundri to have a fairli larg captiv custom in the form of Samsung' own chip design teams, I'm not all that optimist about it chanc as a third-parti contract logic chip manufactur go forward.Apple' choic of TSMC at the 10-nanomet node seem to suggest that TSMC' technolog is superior. I say thi becaus there were report in the past (likethi one) claim that Samsung ""attempt to offer low quot to obtain 14nm FinFET foundri order from Appl in 2015.""I have littl doubt that Samsung would also be will to offer attract price on 10-nanomet wafers. That said, if the technolog doesn't perform as well as Taiwan Semiconductors', or if Samsung' manufactur yield simpli aren't up to snuff (which would diminish the valu of lower wafer prices), I'd expect Appl to pass.Samsung ha also signal that 10-nanomet will be a fairli long node, with multipl iterations. Taiwan Semiconductor, in contrast, ha signal that it 10-nanomet technolog will be a short node as it aim to transit to a superior 7-nanomet technolog in 2018.In light of this, I doubt that Samsung will even be in the run for Apple' A12, which I expect to be manufactur on Taiwan Semiconductors' upcom 7-nanomet technology.Impl for AppleIt' no secret that Appl tend to like have multipl sourc for critic components. With TSMC seemingli so ahead of it main rival, Samsung, Appl is realli down to one viabl choic to manufactur A-seri chips.Apple' sheer scale should still allow it to get good wafer price from TSMC, but it abil to use Samsung as a negoti tool to gain price concess is like to diminish substanti in the come generations.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Micron Technology, Inc.: Can MU Stock Come Back From the Dead?;7/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsMicron Technology, Inc.(MU) stock took a pound the day after the compani post weak fiscal-third-quart earnings, down over 10%.Micron report revenu of $2.9 billion for the quarter, a massiv 24.7% year-over-year declin and $60 million below the consensu on Wall Street.makeArticleAd();Sal at the chipmak have been in declin over the past seven quarters, though the last quarter wa more brutal than most. Although the compani manag to eke out a penni beat after post non-GAAP EP of -8 cent vs. an expect loss of 9 cents, GAAP net loss of $215 million compar veri poorli to the year-ago quarter, when the compani post net incom of $491 million.Shrink Margin for MicronSo Micron stock is now in a sever conundrum where both it top and bottom line are contract in double-digits.10 Stock With More Upsid Than Appl Inc. (AAPL)Investor are, however, typic more concern about Micron' margin trend becaus they correl strongli with the demand/suppli forc in the market.Micron sell two main type of memori products: DRAM and NAND. DRAM is a type of memori found predominantli in PC and mobil devices. DRAM is faster than NAND but is volatil - i.e. data is lost when the devic is power off.NAND, on the other hand, is a type of memori found solid-st drive (SSDs), USB and memori cards. Unlik DRAM, NAND is non-volatil memori that is capabl of retain data even after a devic lose power.Micron is usual coy about reveal the actual averag sell price for it products. Nevertheless, it' not hard to figur that the company' ASP are trend south. After all, Micron report that DRAM bit growth dure the quarter clock in at 22% yet revenu still fell sharply.DRAM sale account for 60% of overal sale dure the quarter, with NAND bring in 31% and Other Product account for the balance. For revenu to have plung so dramatically, it can onli mean that DRAM, and possibl NAND, ASP took anoth big hit.Fal ASP have taken a big bite off Micron stock and margins. Gross margin dure the quarter wa 17% vs. 31.2% a year ago while oper margin clock in at -7.42% compar to 12.74% dure last year' correspond quarter.Unfortun for Micron stock, both DRAM and NAND are highli commoditized, which make it hard for the compani to differenti it product from those by it competitors. Consequ the company' DRAM and NAND busi tend to be highli cyclic and are dictat by swing in demand and supply. 2014 and the earli part 2015 were good time for the company, and it profit soared.But the market were soon flood with too much DRAM, lead to a precipit declin in price dure the latter half of 2015 and thi year. Better factori yield by lead producersSamsung(SSNLF) andSK Hynixar respons for thi state of affairs, as is the refus by smaller Asian manufactur to trim suppli as they look to maintain market share.Throw in weak demand due to an anem PC market that ha refus to recov and Micron stock is find itself wedg between a rock and hard place.Th DRAM oversuppli is expect to continu till earli 2017 befor thing start look up.Product Transit and Cost Cut Might Do the TrickMicron, though, still believ that it can manag to overcom the vagari of a weak market through it ongo product transitions. The compani is move from older 25-nanomet and 30nm DRAM to the newer 20nm, which is in higher demand.

Here's What It Might Take for an InvenSense Turnarournd;7/18/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.It' no secret thatInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) hasn't exactli been the darl of investor as of late. The company' stock price is down 53% over the past 12 months. And the company' revenu plummet 20% year over year in fiscal Q4 2016.InvenSens ha suffer from it depend on sell micro electr mechan system (MEMS) -- typic gyroscop motion sensor -- toSamsungandApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . And InvenSens ha suffer as both smartphon maker have had troubl sell devic recently.makeArticleAd();Still, InvenSens isn't complet wash up, and there are at least two thing that could put it back on track. Let' run through what might help InvenSens get it foot again.InvenSens final realiz it IoT potentialInvenSens ha made some huge gain in shift it focu from mobil to the Internet of Thing (IoT) -- and revenu ha followed.On the company' Q4 earn call, CEO Behrooz Abdi said:W more than doubl our IoT and other revenu in fiscal 2016 with market-lead solut for key emerg platform such as drones, virtual and augment reality, wearables, automot and a varieti of smart home, enterprise, and industri applications.Th revenu increas in InvenSense' ""other"" segment increas from 21% of total revenu in Q3 to 32% in Q4. That increas is a welcom chang as the compani attempt to move away from it mobil dependence.But it'll take more of the same for InvenSens to see a huge chang in the company' revenu diversification. Appl and Samsung still made up about 56% of the company' total revenu in fiscal 2016.Still, the Internet of Thing hold massiv opportun for the company. The entir IoT market size is estim to be worth $7.1 trillion by 2020. And Grandview Research project the MEM market to reach $26 billion by 2022. If InvenSens can continu expand it IoT revenu quickly, investor might still be abl to see the compani turnaround.Blowout iPhon salesIt' critic InvenSens move away from it depend on Appl (and the quicker the better). But as it doe that, strong iPhon sale could still help InvenSense. When Appl report it first-ev year-over-year iPhon sale declin last quarter, InvenSens suffer along with it.Th iPhon maker account for about 40% of InvenSense' total revenu in fiscal 2016. There' no way InvenSens will simpli drop Appl as a custom (though Appl could certainli drop InvenSense), so it' best for InvenSens if Apple' devic are fli off the shelves.Of course, thi doesn't mean InvenSens should just hunker down and bet the farm on what Apple' doing. It need to grow other revenu sources. But as it does, strong iPhon sale could help the compani earn the revenu it need to make invest in other businesses.Thi is go to be a tough one for Appl to pull off, though. KGI secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo ha put the worst-cas scenario for iPhon shipment at just 190 million (that would be lower than the company' 2014 iPhon sales).At least one estim is bet on Apple, though. BMO Capit Market analyst Tim Long say histor iPhon upgrad cycl indic that thi year' devic will surpass previou upgrades, and that 120 million devic fall within the normal upgrad timelin for Appl iPhon users.Additionally,Wel Fargoanalyst Maynard Um recent said Appl is ask it supplier to produc 72 million to 78 million new iPhon for 2016. If true, that would the highest product of iPhon unit for Appl in the past two years.Thes are all guesses, of course. But InvenSens might see some of it mobil revenu rise (and then use them to continu make it mobil exit) if Appl pull off an unexpect iPhon win.Investor takeawayI have to be honest, here: I don't think InvenSense' turnaround is go to happen ani time soon. Sell compon to mobil player is still the company' biggest moneymak and it'll take a while for that to change. And even if InvenSens goe all-in with the IoT, there' still no guarante success in the market.Additionally, InvenSens ha been an Appl supplier dure the iPhon boom time and hasstillseen it stock price crumble. Huge demand for the next iter of the devic (or even the one after that) might not be enough to put InvenSense' revenu or stock price back on track. Rememb that Apple' been abl to put price pressur on InvenSens for quit a while becaus of it larg percentag of business. And thi could weigh down InvenSense' margin even if the next iPhon is successful.So, while it' possibl the abov two scenarioscouldhelp InvenSens get back on track, I think the compani is still too big of a risk for investors.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Nintendo: It's HUUUUGE (Part 1) - Monetization Of Pokemon Go;7/17/2016;"ByMak Financi Services:I can final admit, my childhood best friend wa right... Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) beat Sega. =)I am a 33-year-old millennial, professional, who start my own invest advisori practic after year at Ameripris Financi (AMPF) and UB (NYSE:UBS). I do not own ani current gener video consol nor do I consid myself a gamer. The last consol I purchas wa a Sega Dreamcast more than 10 year ago, on clearance.So when a few day ago my wife ask me if I heard anyth about some Pokemon thing that her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) timelin wa litter with, I genuin had no idea, repli ""No"" and move on.makeArticleAd();Ov the next 24 hour I had seen numer Pokemon Go articl on television, radio and newspaper; countless post on Twitter; and comment in real life from friend whom I did not even know had play video games.What realli took me by surpris were comment such as ""Nintendo gain nearli the entir market cap of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) sinc launch Pokemon Go,"" and ""Pokemon ad as mani user in 5 day as it took Instagram over a year to do.""Such massiv claim were too big to pass up investig so I took the plung and download Pokemon Go and spent the next 48 hour play the game. What I can say now is... it' ""HUGE.""I will discuss in futur articl the major impact that thi game can have socially, such as encourag fit and mental well among children, but for now I want to focu on the monet of the Pokemon Go, beyond in-app purchases, that the major have overlook or chosen to ignore.5 Monet Factor That Are Not Be Taken Into Account1. Sponsor ""PokeSpots"" and ""Gyms""Ther are countless articl in the media about small busi that have seen doubl digit growth as they were lucki to be locat next to a PokeSpot or a Gym. CNBC ha a great articl about ithere.If you have not play the game, PokeSpot and Gym are import -- no, critic -- to the game.Play go to PokeSpot in order to spin the sign to get free item use in the game, such as ball to captur Pokemon and potion to reviv them. They may even be lucki to catch a few egg that will spawn into Pokemon charact after the player walk between 2 and 10 kilometers.Gym are a place where you train and battl Pokemon.In both cases, you must be in proxim to those locat to use them.A I am write this, I am sit at a Starbuck (NASDAQ:SBUX), right in between 2 PokeSpots, work on thi article. There are current at least 3 peopl here, besid me, play Pokemon Go, all of whom paid $5 or more for a beverage.Curr there is no way for a busi to be ad as a PokeSpot, the question is... how mani small busi owner would have ZERO qualm about pay $100, $200, $500 or $1,000 per month in order to have a PokeSpot at their business, or more importantly, their busi made a PokeSpot.In sign that thi may be happening, a Reddit user look at the code notic refer to McDonald' (NYSE:MCD) in the game code. While it is not known if thi wa a deal per say or if thi wa simpli an errant McDonald' near a PokeSpot, how much of a big deal would it be if someon forward think like McDonald' or Starbuck sign a deal to have a Gym locat at their establishment, where they can offer discount to the team in control of their Gym, etc.Ther is proof that larg corpor are take thi seriously. Six Flag (NYSE:SIX) ha put up a great in-depth guid to play Pokemon Go in it parks, which you can findhere.Sid note... Make that 6 peopl play now. A mother and her two daughter just sat down next to me playing.What' realli funni and perfectli make my point... the young girl just said...""Mommy, let' stay here, there are lot of PokeSpot around.""2. In-Gam Advertis & OffersBeyond PokeSpot and Gyms, think of the opportun for busi were geo-loc advertis avail when a user walk by their store.Compani are alreadi do it on app such as FourSquare, a social media platform, and Waze, a crowd-sourc traffic and navig app.If you are a small busi owner in NYC, or heck, even a small downtown area, do you think more peopl are current use FourSquar or will be play Pokemon Go? Wouldn't you be interest in have a messag with Pokemon Go special sent to users, call ""trainers,"" that are walk by your establish or say in a one-quarter-mil vicinity?Here, you can appli a number of payment options, cost per click, cost per view, or cost per acquisition.3. Licens of Pokemon CharactersIt would be extrem silli if you do not believ download of Pokemon Go will not turn into sale of Pokemon merchandise, movi tickets, exist game and other ventures.Pokemon is a huge global brand, with extrem high recognit like on par with Star Wars. By look at theStar War numbers, it is not too hard to believ that Pokemon can gener $500 million or more in licens fees.Furthermore, as the Pokemon franchis grow and individu charact gain new follow and recognition, we can start compar individu Pokemon monster to Marvel' comic book heroes.4. Hardwar Sale & PartnershipsIf you are a parent, or are at least 30 year old, it is not surpris that so mani kid today are obes and social insecure.For the most part, their entertain ha been an X-Box or a PlayStat attach to their TVs. First person shooter and other violent game have been blame for challeng in mental health, social anxieti and awkwardness.Pokemon Go is a game where you MUST go outsid and PLAY if you want to get ahead.Mor than that, the major of the PokeSpot and Gym are at commun center and histor spots, as well as local park and colleg campuses.Not onli will children... ok and adults, get a good workout, but they will also learn about their commun and it history.Nintendo ha announc aPokemon Go Plu devicewhich you can use on the go that will notifi you of nearbi Pokemon by vibrating. It will further allow you to captur them without have to look at your phone if you ran across them in the past.Whil thi would be a great devic for anyon play the game, an even better extens would be a partnership with wearabl maker such as FitBit (NYSE:FIT), Appl (NASDAQ:AAPL) with the Appl Watch, Samsung' Gear (SSNLF) or even Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) or Garmin (GRMN) to creat a fit tracker that integr with the game.If you visit the reddit groups, you will find mani fit peopl combin their regular runs/jogs/walk with Pokemon Go.Ov the last two days, inspir by the game, I did a 2 and a 3.5 mile run outsid look for Pokemon, rather than do a cardio class at the gym or hit the treadmill.Think bigger, sport good retail can creat Pokemon Go-inspir campaign to take advantag of the craze.Th realiti is, mani peopl take their Pokemon Go hunt seriously. Just look at thi YouTub video show a stamped in Central Park.Finally....#5. Appli the Pokemon Go Augment Realiti Model To The Rest Of The Nintendo CatalogYes... Pokemon is a BIG franchis but in time... it may not be the most popular thing out there. Then again... the Facebook fad is still here and Pokemon Go pick up a lot more user in the week it ha been out than Facebook did in it history.Th real stori here is that thi mobil game model is be proven with Pokemon. Where there is perhap even more money and opportun is in appli thi model to the rest of Nintendo' catalog.Can you imagin run around through your town on a Zelda quest? It would be the LARGEST MASSIV Multi Player Role Play game.What about walk down the street dodg barrel thrown at you by Donkey Kong?Last and certainli not least... how mani way can you imagin of bring Mario Brother to life?Our Take & Bottom LineWhat Nintendo and partner have accomplish here is noth short of game changing, pun intended.Pokemon Go repres the pinnacl of ""video games"" that everi parent can be proud of. It is a clean video game that can be enjoy by anyon of ani age, without profan or excess violence. Most of all, if you want to succeed, you are go to get up, off of the sofa and go OUTSID and play.For anyon social awkward, you have an easi avenu to talk to other and build bond over someth you both enjoy -- the hunt for pocket monsters.It is a franchis that is a WIN WIN WIN for everyon involved. A win for the player spend qualiti time outsid and social while get fit at the same time. It is an opportun for parent to spend time with their children to bond and explor the local commun and perhap uncov littl known fact hidden away through the histori of time. It is a win for small busi in the commun who have more peopl come in to visit their establishments, and most of all, it is a win for Nintendo and it shareholders.Th final question that remain is exactli who will profit from Pokemon Go and the add on sales. Is Nintendo the onli player or are there others?Pokemon Go is a joint develop between Niantic Lab and Pokemon Co.Niant is the develop and distributor of the game, while Pokemon Co is the produc of the game.Originally, Niantic wa part of Googl and later spun off. In 2015, they rais equity, with Pokemon Co, Googl and Nintendo be the investors.Nintendo further own between 32% and 33% of Pokemon Co.For all of the game-rel revenues, Nintendo is expos two ways, through it ownership in Niantic, as well as it 33% stake in Pokemon Co.For all of the licensing, Nintendo would earn revenu through it one-third ownership of Pokemon Co.Finally, for the hardwar side, such as for the Pokemon Go Plu device, Nintendo is seemingli earn all of the revenu for itself.I believ that what Pokemon Go repres is the evolut of video games, much like the MP3 format and what Appl iTun ha done for the music and record industry.It is my intent to purchas share of Nintendo across variou account for both short- and long-term purpos over the next week, after publication.For direct revenu from Pokemon Go and the rest of the Pokemon franchise, Nintendo is the most direct way to go, particularli as the vast major of investor are not abl to buy directli into Niantic or Pokemon Co.Anoth way of play thi craze would be buy Appl or Googl (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for their share of in-app purchasing.Finally, for a more specul invest thesis, you could invest in busi that would potenti benefit from thi Pokemon craze, such as potenti partner like McDonald' and Starbuck for food, or at least more Pokemon player come in to play the game. You can go out further and invest in fit apparel produc such as Nike and retail like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Dick Sport Good (NYSE:DKS) and Big 5 Sport Good (NASDAQ:BGFV).Fin Note: I hope you found thi articl helpful.

That' particularli true when you consid that Skywork revenu from it non-iPhon product line are still grow bydoubl digits.Investor will want to compar the company' actual result against thi forecast to see how the compani is fare in thi challeng time.New design wins?In an effort to reduc it depend on the iPhone, Skywork ha wise been build out it busi in a number of new and grow market over the past few years. The compani is push hard to becom a leader in the Internet of Thing trend, and each quarter usual bring announc of new design win in a rang of growth industries.In the recent past we'v seen win in smartwatches, smart TVs, industri GP track devices, and more. Last quarter we even saw the compani expand it presenc with other smartphon provid likeSamsung.Imag source: SkyworksSharehold should keep their ear open to see if the compani wa success in it effort to expand it reach into new market yet again.Mor buybacks?With Skyworks' share price down significantli from it 52-week high it will be interest to see if the compani onc again ramp up it share repurchas efforts. We saw that happen last quarter when manag bought back more than 2 million share for an averag price of $67.50.The company' share have consist trade well below that figur sinc it last report earn were released, so it' not hard to believ that the compani onc again retir a ton of shares. After all, as of April 1 the compani had more than $1.1 billion in cash on it book and no debt, so it' not like the compani can't afford it.Bett time ahead?Finally, investor will want to know if the worst of the declin is in the past, or if the upcom quarter will be anoth pain one.Th market current aren't expect much.

Thi put politician like Hillari Clinton and Presid Barack Obama -- along with the Unit State Senat -- in a posit where, while regular citizen could embrac the latestApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon orSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxi device, our top leader had to carri around 2007' must-hav phone.Finally, however, that ha chang and the U.S. Senat ha sent a memo to the staff of it member which open the door for Appl and Samsung.What doe the memo say?Th chang be implement in the Senat phone polici will move U.S. senat from be the guy and gal still do Austin Power impress or talk like Borat to someth a littl more modern (perhap quot Kevin Hart jokes). It' a big, long-overdu move that end an era.BlackBerry, which peak with just-ov 20% global market share in 2009, had held onto govern contract due to it well-earn reput for security. That continu in recent year even as the compani lost it stranglehold on busi user and larg transit away from phone into software.In thepolici memo, which Politico publish in it entirety, the Mobil Commun Servic offic said that it had been inform that BlackBerri ha discontinu all OS 10 devic (Q10,Z10, Z30, Passport, and Classic). The compani later deni that it ha discontinu the OS 10 phone in a statement toCrackBerry, but that doe not chang that senat can now use certain Appl and Samsung models.Th memo from Mobil Commun Servic note that BlackBerri ""i commit to maintain their support of our devic to includ uninterrupt warranti and technic support."" It also note that it had limit stock of the BlackBerri devic and point out that ""offic wish to make the transit from BlackBerri devic to other platforms"" could switch to Samsung' S6 model or iPhon (with the new iPhon SE be mentioned).Noth wa specifi in the memo as to whether the newer Samsung S7 phone are support or if higher-end iPhon could be used.Thi is not the end for BlackBerryWhil nostalgia or a desir to recaptur past glori ha kept the compani in the phone business, BlackBerri ha been work for year to transit away from that market.

NVIDIA Corporation's GTX 1060 Details Leak;7/4/2016;"A spi shot of the GeForc GTX 1060. Imag source: BenchLife.info.Graph specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) is expect to launch it next gener mid-rang desktop graphic processor, known as the GeForc GTX 1060, sometim thi month. Though the gener launch time frame had been leaked, the specif and expect perform of the card weren't known.makeArticleAd();Thank to aleakof some slide that look as though they were produc by NVIDIA from graphic card focus websit VideoCardz.com, we now know the key detail of thi upcom card. Let' take a closer look.Smal PascalAccord to the leak, the GeForc GTX 1060 pack 1280 CUDA cores, exactli one-half of the number of CUDA core found insid of NVIDIA' flagship GeForc GTX 1080, run at a boost speed of 1.7GHz. It also come with six gigabyt of GDDR5 memori rate at 8Gbp speeds. Assum a memori bu width of 192-bits, VideoCardz calcul the memori bandwidth avail to the GPU at 192 gigabyt per second -- 60% of the bandwidth avail to the GTX 1080.One of theslidesthat VideoCardz show reads, ""the power of GTX 980 for everi gamer,"" which like mean that in term of performance, the 1060 will be as fast as NVIDIA' late-2014 flagship GPU, the GeForc GTX 980.The card itself use a singl six-pin PCI Express power connector and is rate at a 120 watt thermal design power. Thi mean that the card is much more effici than the GeForc GTX 980 (rate at 165 watt and requir two six pin power connectors), someth that will make life easier for user tri to upgrad system with rel low qualiti power supplies.In term of display connectors, the slide show that the GTX 1060 pack three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs, an HDMI 2.0B output, as well as a dual-link DVI connector. Thi should ensur compat with a wide rang of displays.Cost reduc GTX 980I believ that if the GTX 1060 is abl to hit GeForc GTX 980 level perform across the board at the rumor price of $299, it should do well in the marketplace. What' import to note, though, is that the GeForc GTX 1060 should be cheaper to produc than the GTX 970/980, so NVIDIA should be better off bring thi part to market than sell dramat price reduc GTX 980 into thi market.Let' explor thi a littl bit more.Th GTX 980 wa built onTSMC's(NYSE: TSM) 28-nanomet process and measur in at 398 squar millimeters. The GTX 1060, assum it' base on the GP106 chip, is estim to measur in at somewher between 170 squar millimet and 200 squar millimet on TSMC' newer 16-nanomet FinFET process (thisestimatecom from VideoCardz.com as well). Let' call it 200 squar millimet to err on the side of caution.Analyst Handel Jonesestimatesthat a 16-nanomet wafer in late 2016 should run about 70% more than a 28-nanomet wafer by the end of 2014, impli a 70% increas in cost per area. If we take thi estim to be true, thi should impli that a 200 squar millimet GTX 1060 chip should actual cost less to manufactur than a 398 squar millimet GTX 980. It' also worth note that, all els equal, smaller chip tend to yield better than larger chips.From a raw die cost perspective, it would seem that the GTX 1060 should be cheaper to make than the GeForc GTX 980.Beyond the die cost, the board should also be cheaper to make. The GTX 1060 ha a narrow memori bu than the GTX 980 (192-bit versu 256-bit), which should lead to a reduct in complex of the board that the graphic processor is mount on. Additionally, the GTX 1060 requir less power than the GTX 980 doe (120 watt versu 165 watts), which should allow NVIDIA and board partner to use less expens power deliveri system and save on a PCI Express power connector.Th onli area where cost could increas is on the memori chip side of things; the GTX 980 come with just four gigabyt of GDDR5 while the GTX 1060 should come with six gigabytes. That said, the GTX 980 launchedbeforeSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) announc the mass product of 8 gigabit GDDR5 memori chips.Samsung claim in it Januari 2015 press releas that it 8 gigabit GDDR5 chip were the ""industry' first."" Gener speaking, higher densiti memori chip tend to lead to lower cost per bit. In light of this, the six gigabyt of memori on the GTX 1060 may wind up no more expens (or possibl even cheaper) than the four gigabyt of memori on the GTX 970/980.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

The Rio Olympics Are Jumping Into Virtual Reality -- And That's Good News for Facebook and Samsung;7/2/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.TheAssoci Pressrec report (publishedbi ABC) that the Rio Olymp will provid up to 85 hour in virtual realiti (VR), includ the open and close ceremonies, men' basketball, track and field, boxing, beach volleyball, fencing, diving, and gymnastics.

First, Samsung is the offici smartphon sponsor for the Rio Olympics. So use that partnership to bring VR into the mix probabl wasn't much of a stretch.Secondly, Samsung' headset cost just $99, compar to the Oculus' $600 price tag. The Gear VR is cheaper, in part, becaus it' power by Samsung phone as oppos tap into a high-end PC. That also make it less of a true VR experience, but be that these are the nascent day of VR that probabl doesn't matter much to users.Lastly, the Gear VR ha alreadi prove itself in a number of sport broadcasts. Fox Sport broadcast the Daytona 500 in VR and NBC did the same with the most recent Kentucki Derby, and both were onli avail on Samsung' headset.Becaus Samsung' Gear VR is made in collabor with Oculus, the two compani aren't in competit in the VR headset space right now. But the fact that a number of sport VR content, and now the Olympics, are be made avail to Samsung' lower-end headset (a oppos to Oculus' higher-end device) show that Facebook may still have to wait a long time to see benefit of it $2 billion purchase.But there' plenti of opportun for both compani if VR continu to grow among sport viewers.Th VR sport opportunityFox Sport recent sign a five-year deal to bring more sport VR content to it viewers. The deal show the grow interest among broadcast to tri to benefit from the the technology.A recentblog post by the research firm Kzero said, ""We expect the sport stream segment to be a key new genr for consum VR and importantly, we expect thi genr to be highli monetis as consum (read fans) show a willing to pay for new premium content.""Of course, broadcast aren't the onli one that will benefit from this. Samsung is alreadi expect to sell 5 million of it Gear VR headset worldwid thi year and alreadi 1 million peopl use it in in the month of April. Facebook' Oculu is expect to sell as mani as 3.6 million unit thi year, though some analyst have project number as low as the hundr of thousands.But those number don't quit reflect virtual reality' futur opportunity. VR hardwar sale are project to increas from $2.86 billion thi year to $40.26 billion by 2020, accord to research from SuperData. The VR headset market alon is expect to grow from $900 million thi year to $21.25 billion by 2020, accord to Gartner.Th popular sport industri appear to be a uniqu way of bring VR into the hand of consumers, though it' still unclear just how import it could be in drive hardwar sale growth for Facebook' Oculu and Samsung. Rememb that Facebook CFO David Wehner said earlier thi year that, ""VR will not have a materi impact on revenu in 2016.""For now, investor should consid the addit of virtual realiti into the Olymp and other sport event as a good start to what could becom a key industri for VR -- it just make take a while.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple May Be Buying Jay Z's Tidal Music Service;7/1/2016;"Appl Inc.AAPLi reportedli in talk to acquir rapper and mogul Jay Z' music stream servic Tidal, accord to theWal Street Journal. TheJournalcit peopl familiar with the matter, who said that deal talk are ongoing. Jay Z bought Tidal in 2015 for $56 million from Swedish compani Aspiro.It appear that Appl is explor the idea in order to boost it Appl Music stream service, as Tidal ha strong tie with artist like Kany West, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Madonna. West, Beyoncé, and Rihanna all releas their latest albums-Th Life of Pablo,Lemonade, andAnti, respectively-on Tidal exclusively, at least for the first few weeks.At first look, it doesn't seem that a Tidal acquisit is the smartest busi move for Apple. Recently, the compani ha experienc abrupt chang in management, go through three chief execut in less than a year, with one be interim and one appoint by previou management. Former chief busi offic of SoundCloud Jeff Toig ha held the CEO posit sinc January. Tidal is also deal with some lawsuit concern artist royalti and exclus deals.However, when you look back at Apple' purchas of Beats, a Tidal acquisit start to make sense. In 2014, the tech giant shell out a whop $3 billion to buy Beats, a lux headphon maker and stream music servic found by hip-hop produc Dr. Dre. The stream servic essenti turn into Appl Music, but Appl also got valuabl music industri knowledg and connections-in addit to Dr. Dre, legendari music mogul Jimmi Iovine-with the deal.If Appl were to make a bid for Tidal, the compani wouldn't have to face that much competition. SamsungSSNLF, who after month of rumor talks,back awayfrom a potenti deal to buy the service, and Spotify, anoth stream giant, most like can't afford such a takeover. Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogl divis would be the next logic buyer if Appl passes, as their stream music servic would benefit from Tidal' covet librari (Tidal is the onli servic to have the bulk of late music icon Prince' expans catalogue).But Appl may want to hold off on ani talk of buy Tidal for the moment. Spotifi ha recentlygon public with accusations, in a letter from it gener counsel Horacio Gutierrez, claim that Appl is ""'caus grave harm to Spotifi and it customers' by reject an updat to Spotify' iO app,"" accord toRecode. Thi could possibl lead to antitrust activity, so it may be in Apple' best interest to lay low and dodg what appear to be a consolid move of the stream industry.W the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

NVIDIA Corporation's Next King Might Launch Next Quarter;6/30/2016;"Imag source: NVIDIA.I have written quit extens about graphic specialistNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) upcom ultra-high end graphic chip known asGP102.

What we don't know is when exactli the compani intend to launch it.makeArticleAd();Accord to a post from a user over on the Beyond3D forums, GP102 may actual launch fairli soon.Potenti arriv next quarterUs Eriny on the Beyond3D forum claim that ""both GP102 and GP106 will be out next quarter."" Eriny doe not name sources, but thi poster' track record actual appear to be quit solid.Back in May 2015, when rumor were float around that NVIDIA might tapSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) to manufactur it next gener Tegra processor codenam Parker, the user claim that it would actual be built onTSMC's(NYSE: TSM) 16-nanomet FinFET process. That user also said that Parker would use NVIDIA' custom Denver CPU core rather thanARM's(NASDAQ: ARMH) Cortex A72, anoth tidbit that wound up be correct.Then, in June of 2015, the user claim that NVIDIA' GP100 chip, which power the recent announc Tesla P100 accelerators, had tape out -- mean that the design wa complete. It often take about a year to go from tape-out to mass production, and given that the part were in product as of NVIDIA' May earn call, it would seem that thi inform wa good.Finally, the user claim that NVIDIA' next gener graphic processor would be built at TSMC and not at Samsung as rumored, someth that onc again prove true.I don't know who thi user is, but her/hi track record appear to be excel when it come to futur NVIDIA products.Strik while the iron is hot; I like itNVIDIA' revenu growth stori in game ha been driven by two major factors: unit growth as well as an increas in averag sell prices, as the slide below shows.Imag source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA can drive averag sell price up as long as it deliv product that deliv extrem high performance. So, for example, if GP102 wind up be approxim 33% faster than the GP104-base GeForc GTX 1080, then the compani should be abl to charg at least 33% more while still offer a compel performance-per-dollar.Not that the premium that NVIDIA can charg for GP102 rel to GP104 depend significantli onwhenit releas it. If GP102 is releas about a quarter after GP104 is, then the compani should have littl issu get paid a premium at least equival to the increment perform that it delivers.If GP102 were to arrive, say, 6-12 month after GP104, then the premium that it can charg will like come down, particularli if competit pressur becom greater in that time.At ani rate, if NVIDIA can get GP102 out within the next 2-3 months, like as an ultra-enthusiast product under it Titan branding, then thi should have a posit impact on the company' averag sell price and gross margins.If all of the Pascal chip come in 2016, then might we see Volta in 2017?If NVIDIA is abl to pull off get the entir high-end Pascal lineup out to consum dure 2016, then I have to wonder about when we might expect the compani to roll out it Volta-bas graphic processors.NVIDIA' (admittedli veri vague) most recent product road map from GTC 2016 show Volta arriv sometim in late 2017 or in 2018:Imag source: NVIDIA.If NVIDIA roll out all of it high-end Pascal part in 2016, then it' like go to needsomethingto launch in 2017 in order to keep the momentum going.

But the good news doesn't stop with display drivers, as evidenc by the recent announc of the ""broad availability"" of it much-anticip ID touch sensor specif design for smart cars.In addit to the obviou touch sensor encrypt and biometr applications, includ unlock a vehicl or start it with noth more than a touch, Synapt said it new ""fingerprint sensor evalu kit (EVK)"" also recogn ""user input gestur includ swipes, tap and long presses,"" make it ideal for infotain system as well.Car are quickli becom the ultim mobil device, and the potenti for new featur such as Synaptics' solut are nearli limitless. That, of course, mean some headi competit from touch-sensor earli adopters, includingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .Oh, the possibilitiesA far back as the iPhon 5s releas in the fall of 2013 and the Samsung Galaxi 5s introduc in earli 2014, fingerprint sensor were promin featured. It' not difficult to imagin either of the industry' big boy -- both of whom are activ target the smart car market, too -- translat similar fingerprint ID touch technolog as part of their respect car solutions.But don't count Synapt out. Thank in part to it exist relationship with global auto manufacturers, Synapt ha a built-in base of custom to target for it new EVK solution. And at $402.5 million in sale last quarter -- Synaptics' fiscal 2016 Q3 -- it will take a lot less to move the revenu needl in the right direct than for either Apple' or Samsung' smart car efforts.Not to mention, base on virtual everi estimate, the automot infotain market is pois to explode. One forecast suggest infotain system will gener $33.8 billion in revenu by 2022 -- and that could prove overli conserv consid the result of a recent survey.A group of new car buyer were ask which wa more import to them, their new car' infotain system, or drive performance. In today' mobile-centr world, the infotain system ha alreadi becom more import to a major of new car buyer than performance. Of course, Synaptics' newli introduc fingerprint sensor kit ha a host of potenti applic beyond infotainment, but it rapid adopt could springboard the use of ID sensor throughout a car.Th EVK solut wa like one of the new opportun CEO Rick Bergman wa consid when he allud to Synaptics' ""short-term paus in our top-lin growth"" last quarter. No, smart car fingerprint sensor won't miracul turn Synaptics' revenu misfortun around overnight: transform a busi to tackl new opportun take a while.However, at it current depress stock price and long-term growth prospect in a skyrocketing, multibillion-dollar market at the ready, Synapt warrant a good, long look for investor in search of value.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

An Apple iPhone Super Cycle In 2017?;6/25/2016;"So far,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) big year in 2016 ha yet to materialize.AAPLdata byYChartsmakeArticleAd();Wors yet, increasingli widespread rumor suggest it might not come at all. Though still not a given, it seem more and more like that the upcom iPhon 7 will prove onli an increment improv over the iPhon 6s, break Apple' long-stand tradit of even-year form factor overhauls.Thi is like a neg in the near-term forAppl stock, as it removesth key catalystso many, myself included, had bake into their 2016 Appl invest thesis. However, as one analyst notes, thi near-term neg come with a long-term positive.Th next, next iPhoneIn a recent note to clients,Credit Suisseanalyst Kulbind Garcha made the case that 2017 will in fact be the year Appl return to meaning growth. In hi analysis, Garcha see a tepid consum respons for the iPhon 7 on the assumpt that it form factor will remain larg in line with the current iPhon 6s and 6s Plus.Instead, Garcha argu that Appl will use 2017, the 10-year anniversari of the origin iPhone, to launch a dramat revamp handset. Accord to hi analysis, the fall 2017 iPhon will feature, among other things, an all-glass case that could possibl be curved. The iPhon 2017 iPhon may also includ ""featur and upgrades, includ an OLE [organ light-emit diode] screen, full glass display, no home button, enhanc Taptic Engine, improv camera, and wireless charging."" Garcha also see Appl call the devic the iPhon 8, rather than the 7s.With the iPhon respons for the major of Appl sales, thi dramat increas the odd that Appl stock will remain rel rang bound for the rest of the year. No new product of note like mean a less-than-memor year for the Mac maker. However, thi also like set the stage for 2017 to be a blockbust one for patient Appl investors.Th ultim iPhon ""super cycle""If thi turn out to be the case, it mean next year will like see appreci gain to Appl stock. Thi make sens at both strateg and financi levels.I'm not the onli one who' comment on how rival high-end smartphones, likeSamsung' Galaxi S7, today trumpApple' current iPhones. However, given Apple' long-stand histor track record of user retention, the risk of mass custom defect remain rel muted, even if the iPhon 7 disappoints.Imag Source: AppleIn thi scenario, Appl will be simpli shift the embed demand for it iPhon from one year to the next. In fact, wait one addit year to launch an impress iPhon upgrad should actual add to the latent demand for the forthcom device. Seen thi way, Garcha' purport iPhon 8 would reach market to histor high level of demand and all the financi reward that would come with it. Especi when combin with Apple' ongoingintern expansionefforts, next year' iPhon would then like see a return to growth for Appl stock the like of which we haven't seen sinc the launch of the iPhon 6.Ad some specif to thi idea, Garcha' analysi call for reduc Appl EP in it fiscal 2016 and 2017; rememb the iPhon typic debut in September, toward the end of Apple' fiscal year. However, in 2018, Garcha see Appl gener $12.32 per share in earnings, an increas of roughli 50% over thi year' averag analyst estimate.Hav to wait anoth year to see a major potenti move in Appl stock is probabl understand frustrat for investors. However, if you believ thi analysis, the risk-reward dynam today remain tilt heavili in Apple' favor, especi when consid addit possibl catalyst like increas capit return and possibl new products.

What Is a Tiered Royalty?;6/24/2016;"Imag source: Getti Images.Ti royalti rate are design to gener maximum revenu (and, eventually, profit) from a licens agreement. In a standard patent, copyright, or trademark license, the inventor charg it partner either a flat fee or a simpl percentag of total sales. Tier royalti go one step further by adjust those simpl royalti rate in variou ways. The result: Both the inventor and the manufacturing/distribut partner can maxim their sales, and thu serv their sharehold better.makeArticleAd();Let me illustr the concept through a coupl of exampl scenarios.Promot lot of volumeIn it simplest form, a tier royalti deal act like a volum discount. The first 100,000 unit sold while use the intellectu properti asset in question might send 5% of the distributor' net sale to the origin inventor or designer. Unit 100,001 to 1 million could fetch an 8% royalti rate, and anyth beyond that would be tag for a 5% royalti fee.That' an incent to drive higher sale volumes. With thi type of royalti structur in place, manufactur and distributor have a solid reason to put their back into market blitzes. Meanwhile, the origin inventor of the patent -- or design of the trademark and copyright inform -- is assur of decent payout when sale volum turn out to be small.In a slightli more complic real-world scenario, display technolog researcherUnivers Display(NASDAQ: OLED)sign a six-year OLE technolog dealwith electron giantSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) in 2011. Here, the compani replac a simpl royalti percentag agreement with a two-part structure:Samsung pay Univers Display a flat fee in installments, onc everi other quarter. Thi sum start at $10 million in 2011 and ha escal to a total of $60 million in 2016. Thi slide scale wa put in place in the origin contract, and the increas are predictable.On top of that licens arrangement, Univers Display also resel the requir OLE chemic and pocket a fee for that service. Samsung ha agre to certain purchas volum and is alway free to order more than expected. That revenu stream is nearli twice the size of the base licens payment, with the caveat that Univers Display doesn't break out Samsung' materi contribut from other clients. Gross margin from thi process current stand at 71%, deduct the cost of order the actual materi from chemic manufacturerPPG Industries.Lik the ""volum discount"" example, thi structur promot high product volum and give Samsung everi reason to step up manufactur and sale of OLE products. Slow down would make the basic licens fee more costli on a per-unit basis, and it could trigger other penalti for not buy enough materials.Th nitty-gritti detail are not public knowledge, and the compani are like to hammer out a new deal when thi contract expir in 2017. The detail we do have still make for an enlighten exampl of an altern tier royalti agreement.Imag source: Getti Images.Glob reachTier royalti are veri popular in the pharmaceut industry. In thi case, it' a matter of target each market accord to what patient and insur system are abl to pay.Th World Health Organizationrecommendsa tier royalti method when set price in the develop world. Crucial medic for life-threaten diseas like malaria or HIV/AID should start by determin their royalti rate in high-incom markets. The rate from place like the U.S. and Germani are then adjust for rel incom per capita when set price in less prosper countries. Furthermore, nation with particularli high diseas burden get an addit discount beyond what' normal a heavi per-capita incom rebate.Thi structur let drug develop and medic devic inventor recoup their develop cost with larg royalti in richer markets. At the same time, the benefit of their invent are extend to place that cannot afford the first-world payments. The arrang benefit the drug develop too: Place like Somalia and Surinam can gener a modest level of low-margin sales. Under the standard royalti rate, sale would be indistinguish from zero in these markets.Thes are just a coupl of exampl of tier royalti rate and how they can boost business. Tier structur allow the parti to tailor agreement to their specif market conditions. When thi is done right, tier royalti can boost overal sale while maxim the result revenu and bottom-lin profits.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Google's Radical Plan to Reinvent the Smartphone Could Devastate Apple and Samsung;6/23/2016;"A Project Ara smartphone. Imag source: Google.comLat thi year, Googl will launch it veri first smartphone. It could be the most revolutionari handset to hit the market sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) sold the origin iPhon back in 2007.In the past,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) search giant ha work with it variou hardwar partner to deliv Google-brand Nexu phones, but it ha never made a smartphon from start to finish. That will chang later thi year when it Project Ara smartphon goe on sale. Initially, it will be aim at developers, but Googl plan to sell it to consum in 2017.makeArticleAd();Project Ara' success isn't guaranteed. Indeed, given it unorthodox nature, it could prove to be a dramat failure. But if it succeeds, it could shake the veri foundat of the handset market, and undermin the busi model of both Appl andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .A differ vision, but at least it' not vaporwareProject Ara wa origin announc back in 2013, and then demonstr publicli in 2014. It wa suppos to begin ship in the second half of last year, but in August, Googl announc that it had been delayed. At the time,I warn that Project Ara seem to be run the risk of becom vaporware-- a promis devic that, for whatev reason, fell short of intern expect and never made it to the public.Fortunately, that' not the case. To be clear, the Project Ara phone ship later thi year is a less ambiti devic than the one Googl describ previously. Originally, Project Ara would'v been perhap the last phone you'd ever need to buy -- with a fulli modular design, consum would buy a phone frame from Google, then outfit it with a varieti of modules. These modul would encompass key components, includ the processor, memory, cellular radio, and display.Now, those key compon are integr into Project Ara' frame, along with a set of speakers. It' still a modular device, but the modul are limit to ancillari functions. The most use may be the camera -- those will and abl to purchas the proper camera modul could equip their Project Ara phone with a truli professional-grad camera. Other modul could add projectors, fit sensors, game controllers, secondari displays, or larger batteries. Almost anyth is possible. Each Project Ara phone can take up to six modules, allow for a great degre of custom and ad functionality.Redefin consum expectationsGoogle' Android oper system ha manag to captureabout 80% of the world' smartphon userslarg becaus of it custom options. Handset manufactur are free to use the Android oper system on almost ani smartphone, which ha led to a flurri of differ models. There' an Android phone sold at virtual everi price point, in everi size, on everi carrier, in everi country.Project Ara will bring custom to an entir new level. There' still a lot reason to doubt Project Ara' chances: Beyond Google' rel inexperi when it come to sell handset at scale, it' not clear that consum will want to deal with the hassl of swap modules. Introduc a wide varieti of differ hardwar configur could lead to bugs, or other unforeseen circumst that make the user experi less than ideal. Mani of the more attract Project Ara modul could be expensive, and consum may not be abl to take advantag of gener financ plan current offer by carrier to purchas them.But if Project Ara doe succeed, it could chang how consum view the smartphon market. If must-have, revolutionari modul emerge, integr phone that cannot work with Project Ara' modul could be at an immens disadvantage.Samsung and Appl remain theworld' largest smartphon sellers, and therefor remain the most suscept to competition. Appl deriv nearli two-third of it revenu from the iPhon last quarter, and like a larger percentag of it profit. Samsung is a more diversifi business, but it mobil devic still brought in more than half it sale last quarter.Both compani have face competit from a wide varieti of sourc in recent years, but they'v never face a competitor like Project Ara before.

Apple Inc.

The Indian govern will grant a three-year grace period befor requir single-brand retail to compli with the 30% sourc requirement. Additionally, compani deem as sell ""state of the art or cut edg technology"" may enjoy an addit five-year window befor they must adher to the stringent sourc rules.Pract speaking, thi announc open the door for Appl to appli to open it first wholli Apple-own retail store in the world' fastest-grow major smartphon market. Comment on the matter in a Bloomberg report, retail consult Devangshu Dutta said: ""The relax rule give Appl a window to build up a credibl brand and give the compani a chanc to build up intern capabl and familiar with the suppli base. ... For branding, a certain consist is critic and thi can be done by have retail control.""Until thi point, Appl ha been forc to partner with local retail firm and electron chain to distribut it products, a dynam that Appl reportedli feel ha hamper the qualiti of the custom experi it so deepli values.An undeni opportunityWith global smartphon shipment slowing, most worryingli in China, India remain the lone nation with enough growth potenti to possibl move the needl for a corpor giant like Apple.

As a quick point of addit contrast, China record roughli 438 million smartphon shipment in 2015, accord to Strategi Analytics. If anything, the chart abov speak to the immens latent growth potenti the market offer handset maker like Apple,Samsung,Xiaomi, and others.With Apple' revenu expect to contract in it current fiscal year, especi if the iPhon 7 prove onli an increment improv over the 6s, the compani clearli need to access ani and all possibl growth opportunities. And with China and much of the rest of the world' smartphon shipment slowing, India is perhap the last obviou major growth market avail for the company.At the same time, India isn't the most obviou fit for Apple' high-pric handsets. Roughli three-quart of smartphon in India are sold for less than $150, and per-capita incom in India are about one-tenth of those in the Unit State at constant prices.Appl launch the iPhon SE earlier thi year in hope that it new ""low cost"" handset might bridg the chasm to Apple' pricey handsets. Though certainli a price improv over it more expens devices, the iPhon SE' roughli $580 sticker price, after tax and tariffs, is like unattain for most Indian citizens.To be sure, an Appl move to open it own Appl retail store in India should help bolster it presenc in a market with truli impress long-term potential.

3 New Features the iPhone 7 MUST Have;6/10/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsDespit effort to diversify,Appl Inc.(AAPL) remain huge depend on the iPhone. New product like the Appl Watch and a revamp Appl TV repres a drop in the bucket compar to the sort of number a new iPhon typic bring in.Source:via AppleBut come off the first quarter sinc it 2007 launch in which iPhon sale have declined, more than ever AAPL need the iPhon 7 to be a hit.makeArticleAd();With the expect Septemb releas date creep closer, here are three featur the iPhon 7musthav if it' go to convinc peopl to upgrad and be the big seller Appl needs.Featur the iPhon 7 Must Have: A Better CameraTh iPhon help to kick off the smartphone-as-a-camera movement, and Appl ha come to domin tradit camera maker when it come to post photo online. CheckYahoo! Inc.' (YHOO)Flickr photo share site, and variou iPhon model top the popular list.Th 10 Best Tech Gadget to Take to the BeachHowever, with the iPhon 6s, Apple' lead in smartphon camera superior slipped. It' not that the iPhon 6s didn't have a good camera, but beyond bump the resolution, AAPL didn't do much in the way ofimprovementov the previou generation.Arch-rivalSamsung(SSNLF), on the other hand, complet redesign the camera it put in the Galaxi S7. It ha a wider apertur and larger pixel than the iPhone' (result in better low-light shooting) and in tests, Samsung' new dual-pixel sensor allow it tofocu on subject three to four time fasterthan the iPhone' camera.Th camera is one of the iPhone' signatur features, so there are brag right at stake. And more importantly, a dramat improv camera - not just a bump in resolut - is one of those key featur that could convinc current owner to upgrad to a new iPhone.Featur the iPhon 7 Must Have: More StorageAppl ha offer 16GB as the base storag in it smartphon sinc the iPhon 5 wa releas in 2012. Sinc that time, new iPhon have come with higher resolut cameras, gain 4K video capability, adopt higher resolut display and the iO - the oper system that power the devic - ha grown in size. All of these factor eat into storag space. Photo requir more storage, 4K video requiresdramaticallymor storag and app are use up more space.Appl ha stubbornli kept the base storag of the iPhon at 16GB, point to featur like iCloud storag and Appl Music stream as option to reduc the amount of storag requir locally.In reality, the decis seem more business-based. With Flash memori an inexpens commodity, AAPL wa reportedli make an extra $88 in profit everi time a new iPhon buyer decid 16GB wa too littl and spent the $100 extra to upgrad to the next level of storag capacity.With the iPhon 7, Appl need to accept realiti and boost the storag capac of it base model to at least 32GB. The Galaxi S7 come with 32GB standard,Alphabet Inc' (GOOG,GOOGL) Googl Nexu 6P come with 32GB and theLGG5 ha 32GB. In fact, 16GB of storag is pretti much found onli in budget smartphon these day … and the Appl iPhone.Besid the fact that it look terribl in comparison charts, the iPhon 7 need to move up from 16GB of storag or Appl is go to face a backlash from consum who are fed up with juggl apps, music and video due to chronic storag issues.Featur the iPhon 7 Must Have: Water ResistanceOn tentpol featur that AAPL appear to have been work toward is a waterproof - or at least water-resist - iPhone.Wat damag is one of the big caus for iPhon damage, and it' also one of the lead caus of expens iPhon repairs. And when you think about it, thi make sense. It' not just the risk of accident spill a drink on your smartphon - when we carri these thing everywhere, all the time, and use them constantly, they'r go to get expos to the elements.Th issu of water damag is common enough that Appl put liquid contact indic in it iPhon and won't honor the warrantyif it decid there ha been water damage.In contrast, the Galaxi S7 is rate asIP68wat and dust resistant. It can be use in the rain, mud can simpli be wipe off and it will even surviv a 30-minut dunk in five feet of water. All of these scenario could result in a costli repair bill with an iPhone.Appl began quietli experi with design chang start with the iPhon 6 that have improv water resistance, but releas an iPhon 7 that wa actual rate as water-resist would be a big enough featur that mani holdout would upgrad from their older iPhones. And it' about time iPhon user could text, take a call or snap a photo outdoor without worri that rain could brick their device.E3 Rumors: What to Expect at Video Gaming' Big EventOf cours there are plenti of other featur high on the wish list of iPhon fan - a higher resolution, OLE display is one of the big ones.

3 Apple Inc. Suppliers That Could Benefit from the iPhone 7 Launch;6/10/2016;"Imag credit: Apple.In September,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expect to unveil it next gener iPhone, presum call the iPhon 7. The devic is go to be a particularli import one for the compani as it look to recov from the slump in sale that it suffer from throughout the iPhon 6s cycle.makeArticleAd();Although it' far too earli to tell how well the devic will do in the market, particularli as the weak recept to the iPhon 6s seri seemingli came as a surpris to everyon (includ Appl itself), there are a number of Appl supplier that should benefit from the launch. Here are three.1. IntelChip giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) ha been harshli critic for larg miss out on the smartphon revolution. The compani ha tri for year to build product suitabl for smartphones, but asid from a few token design wins, it ha been unsuccessful.However, there are sever report that Intel will win the modem/baseband spot insid some percentag of the next gener iPhon that ship. If the report are true, then whether Appl see iPhon unit growth or not over the come product cycle, Intel should benefit by virtu of simpli ship modem to Appl dure thi iPhon cycl when it hadn't in mani previou cycles.Look longer-term, if Intel can execut to a seri of competit modem products, it may be abl to continu to win spot in futur iPhones. Thi isn't like to be a huge revenue/profit driver for the company, but as long as Intel can gener increment profit from such deals, I don't think sharehold will complain.2. BroadcomToday'sBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is a combin of a compani that wa formerli known as Broadcom (manag refer to it as ""Classic Broadcom"") and Avago. Both Classic Broadcom and Avago were supplier to Apple. Avago provid RF filter while Classic Broadcom provid a Wi-Fi chip as well as some other components.On Broadcom' recent earn call, manag indic that it expect to see a signific increas in both RF content in the next iPhon (which would benefit ""Classic Avago"") as well as a boost in Wi-Fi content (which benefit ""Classic Broadcom"").Thi mean that even if iPhon unit sale don't grow much (or at all), Broadcom could still regist revenu growth relat to the iPhon in the come product cycle.3. TSMCFor the A8 chip that power the iPhon 6/6 Plus, as well as the A8X chip that power the iPad Air 2, Appl move away from longtim chip manufactur partnerSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) and toward Taiwan-bas contract chip manufacturerTSMC(NYSE: TSM) .For the A9 chip that power the iPhon 6s/iPhon 6s Plus, Appl split the order between TSMC and Samsung (and it is gener believ that TSMC got the minor alloc of the orders).However, for the upcom A10 chip, it is wide believ that Appl will move back to TSMC exclusively. Furthermore, it is expect that the A10 will use TSMC' new chip packag technolog known as InFO, which should give TSMC greater content share.In thi case, just as with Intel and Broadcom, TSMC should benefit from thi come iPhon cycl whether or not iPhon shipment ultim grow or not.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Samsung;6/1/2016;"Doughnut or bananas? Both can be pretti sweet, actually.Samsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) is the Korean poster boy for consum electronics, deepli involv in everi corner of that market.Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) battl Samsung head-to-head in the memori chip sector -- and that' all.makeArticleAd();So we'r look at two veri differ compani here, even though they are direct rival in one import market. Which stock is the better fit for your own invest portfolio?Befor we get startedLet' just clear up one import detail right here. No, Samsung share are not trade on ani of the major American stock markets. The stock is issu on the Korean stock exchange, Korea Exchange, with proper global depositari receipt avail on the London and Luxembourg exchanges. The ""global"" bit of that monik is somewhat misleading, sinc U.S. resid are explicitli forbidden from trade these papers.But you can still own Samsung shares. Two American bank have the right to buy and sell Samsung share directli on the Korean market, on behalf of their customers. Or you can drop down to the over-the-count or Pink Sheet market to grab a varieti of not-quite-authorit Samsung shares. These altern share tend to follow the offici stock in the long run, but it' not a perfect fit and you may miss out on some import sharehold rights. Find out more onSamsung' investor relationspages.Oh, and Micron' headquart can be found in Boise, Idaho. That' about 670 mile away from Silicon Valley. It' a two-lett ticker, trade on the tradit four-lett Nasdaq Stock Market. I think that cover Micron' deepest mysteries.Bi the numbersBoth compani are run into a chang environ for consum technologies.Samsung' annual sale fell 2.6% in 2015, and net profit declin by 18.5%. For Micron, revenu slid 1% lower, and dilut earn fell 2.8%.Both compani point to weak demand from a hand of end-us markets. In particular, mobile-devic growth is take a global breather. On the other hand, enterpris are get into solid-st drive in a big way, which help the memori maker prop up their revenu flow until the consum come around again.That just about explain Micron' current situation. However, memori chip account for just 17% of Samsung' annual sales. Mobil devic serv as the company' largest division, show single-digit sale declin in 2015. Here, manag is look for a single-digit rebound in 2016.The Samsung Galaxi S7 Edg handset, an import piec of the Korean company' current business. Imag source:Samsung.Dig deeperSo neither Micron nor Samsung are show ani sign of massiv growth prospect these days. Micron' play on economi of scale ha larg play out already, so the compani must now simpli out-execut the competition. Samsung' mobil growth is stalling,along with the restof that former hypergrowth market.Samsung is the far larger busi here, and it oper are more diverse. Unfortunately, the largest end market in Samsung' sight doe not seem due for ani massiv growth spurt ani time soon. The upcom fifth-gener wireless rollout may prove me wrong, but even that expect growth driver is still sever year away.For Micron, the path back to steadi growth run through the PC and server markets. Mobil growth would be nice for Micron too, but the compani isn't bet on it as heavili as Samsung is. Thi is not necessarili an easier road, but solid-st drive should lead the way for at least a coupl more years. The tradit hard-driv builder are shake in their boot over thi revolut and do their best to adapt to thi new reality. Micron and Samsung sit on the other end of that equation.So which stock should I own?Personally, I alreadi own Micron shares. That posit wa built in 2013, as the game-chang Elpida buyout inch toward completion. But the origin invest thesi ha run it course. In retrospect, I could have sold at the end of 2014 for a nifti sixfold gain. Share price have retreat by a hair-rais 64% from those highs.That make Micron a deepli discount valu stock in my view. I'm not say that the stock incontrovert belong north of $35 per share, or that the PC market is due for anoth kick-start. But the stock is trade right at Micron' current book value, which mean that market maker think that investor would pretti much break even if the compani just sold off it asset and got out of do business.Thati an unreason conclusion, and a signpost on the road to renew share price growth. Even if the busi just hold steadi at it current cash flow and return on equity, it valuat multipl should rise higher.Samsung is in a veri similar boat, with price-to-book valu just abov 1.0. It' also a far more profit business, with much deeper pocket in case the market drought stick around for sever years. Everyth I said about Micron also appli to Samsung, and perhap to an even greater degree.I think we have two winner here. I'll simpli stick with my exist Micron posit for now, but new money could just as easili get into Samsung at these bargain-bin prices.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc.: Why AAPL Shouldn’t Budge on iPhone Prices;5/27/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsSamsung' (SSNLF) smartphon lead onAppl Inc.(AAPL) widen dure the first quarter; it wa the effect of an aggress price strategi for the Galaxi S7 and S7 Edg smartphones. Given Apple' recent troubl in the smartphon arena, mani analyst and investor are look to Samsung' success and demand that AAPl follow a similar strategi in order to boostAppl stock.Source:iphonedigit via FlickrFurthermore, with Apple' success in the servic business, it ha provid activist with the need ammunit to spark real debat regard thi iPhon discount conversation.makeArticleAd();Aft all, Appl may not make as much money from the sale of hardware, but it can get more peopl on it ecosystem to consum services. Although all of thi think is logical, it would be a bad idea for the compani and Appl stock.Appl Stock Doesn't Need Reduc iPhon PricesIn the first quarter of 2015, Samsung sold 21 million more smartphon than Apple. But in the first quarter thi year, Samsung' lead jump to nearli 30 million devices, spark by what Kantar' Lauren Guenveur call the ""most heavili promot phones, ever"". That' say a lot.Whil it may seem that Appl should follow suit, the biggest reason Appl should not follow Samsung is becaus it doe not need too.Th 10 Best Healthcar Stock to Buy NowYes, Apple' unit sale declin by more than 8 million year-over-year. That seem alarming, but investor have to rememb that Appl is in an ""S"" year for iPhones, and thi year is be compar to Apple' best perform 12-month period for iPhon in half a decade.For example, unit sale for smartphon in Apple' fiscal second quarter last year jump 40% to 61.2 million unit and revenu jump 55% to $40.3 billion. Those were huge jumps, and a reflect of Appl enter new market and launch two smartphon - the 6 and 6 Plu - at the same time, versu one (the 5s) in the year prior.Given how ""S"" year tend to underperform ""number"" year for iPhon launches, 2015 wa the perfect storm for AAPL to deliv unpreced results.With that said, if you look sole at Apple' fiscal second quarter, and remov last year' ""perfect storm,"" it $32.9 billion in revenu from iPhon sale thi year is 26% greater than the same period in 2014. And the 51.2 million devic repres a 17% increase.In other words, iPhon revenu and unit sale have grown 26% and 17%, respectively, over the last two years, which is a veri impress compound annual growth rate for a compani of thi size. Therefore, consid that 2016 is an ""s"" year, and that the 7 and 7Plu are sure to be superior launches. And then, realiz that Appl doe not need to discount unit prices.Th Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stock to Buy NowTh fact is that iPhon sale are still very, veri strong.A coupl other thing to considerWhen you realli think about it, AAPL would be insan to reduc iPhon prices. Yes, servic are grow at a 20% annual rate, but account for just under 12% of total revenu versu 65% of total revenu from iPhones. Therefore, if AAPL bet wrong on iPhon prices, it could caus far more harm than good to total revenue.In addition, if AAPL reduc iPhon prices, margin are go to fall, therefor earn per share are go to fall, and there is no guarante that it can gain enough new market share to counter these reductions. Lastly, onc a compani reduc price for primari product and services, it is kind of an admiss of defeat, and is veri difficult to come back from.Specifically, how doe Appl then rais price if it reduc them?I think it would be an immature, short-sight move on behalf of Appl management, and is therebi virtual impossible.Th fact is that it would do more harm to Appl stock than good, becaus at the end of the day, iPhon sale are fine and Appl stock will be better than ever onc the iPhon 7, 7 Plu launch prove all doubter wrong.A of thi writing, Brian Nichol wa long AAPL.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 7 Best Tech Stock … Of 2020!30 Stock the Smart Money Just Bought or DumpedTh postAppl Inc.: Whi AAPL Shouldn't Budg on iPhon Pricesappear first onInvestorPlace."

2016 Hasn't Been a Great Year for Apple So Far;5/25/2016;"Perhap you'v alreadi noticed, butApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) have a fairli drab year so far. Sure, the company' stock is down about about 7% sinc the begin of the year, but there' much more to it than that.Apple' had some bad news in few of it product categori over the past five months, and some of the company' biggest prospect are have a hard time gain traction.makeArticleAd();Let' take a quick look at how the company' year is go so far:iPhon sale slippedIt' no secret that Apple' iPhon sale fell in fiscal Q2 by 16% year-over-year, the company' first-ev year drop sinc the devic debuted. Most of the problem stem from stagnat demand in China, where iPhon sale were down 26% year-over-year.Th news wasn't all that surpris consid Appl mention back in Januari that iPhon sale would slow, but that didn't make news ani easier to swallow for investors.Th success of the iPhon 6 last year made it difficult for the 6s to outperform it sale numbers, but it' hard to know right now whether thenext iPhonewil bring sale back to their usual levels, or if lower sale are the new normal.Appl Watch get a price cutAppl enter the wearabl market just over a year ago, and so far it' do pretti well. The compani current hold the No. 1 posit for smartwatch sale and is the No. 2 worldwid wearabl tech vendor, accord to IDC.But Appl made a curiou move in March when it announc $50, or 14%, price cut for the Appl Watch. Despit the compani make some posit inroad into wearables, the price cut is clearli a move to spur sales.It' not unpreced for Appl to drop the price of a new devic (it shave $200 off the origin iPhon price a few month after it launched), but it still indic that Appl mani be unhappi with the number of Appl Watch sales.Chromebook overtak MacsIn the first quarter of thi year Chromebook shipment surpass Mac shipment for the first time ever.Most of thi came from increas Chromebook sale in the U.S. to the K-12 educ market.

And with iPhon sale slip in the current second-biggest smartphon market -- the U.S. -- Appl is in need of find a new countri where it can increas sales.It' not all badAppl could turn thing around in the second half of thi year, of course. These problem could all be fix over time with the right strategies.Apple' servic revenu wa up 20% year-over-year to $6 billion, and the compani end fiscal Q2 with $233 billion in cash and market securities. Additionally, sale from the quarter didn't includ the company' latest iPhon SE release, so we'll have to wait until next quarter to see if those help prop up iPhon sales.Appl could certainli turn thing around the rest of thi year, but the problem list abov certainli should give investor some concern as Appl seek to grow in the post-PC and soon-to-b post-mobil era.Someth big just happenedI don't know about you, but I alway pay attent when one of the best growth investor in the world give me a stock tip.

Is Apple Inc. Wrong About India?;5/25/2016;"You'v probabl noticedApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ha increas it focu on India lately. The iPhon maker ha been woo the countri for the past few year and Appl CEO Tim Cook recent ramp that up with a busi trip to India.Appl is do everyth it can to make India it next big growth market. And there are plenti of good reason for this.makeArticleAd();Th first be that India is expect to overtak the U.S. as the second-largest smartphon market next year, and is current grow 5 time faster than China' smartphon market.But sell phone in India isn't easy. Govern regul and low averag sell price (ASPs) are stifl Apple' progress.Appl see massiv smartphon potenti in one of the world' most popul countries, but is the compani wrong to think it can succeed there?Th problem with Appl in IndiaApple' problem in India can be sum up with just two simpl facts: iPhon are too expens and the compani is struggl to bring down their price in the country.Th averag sell price for an iPhon in India is $612. The high price tag come partli from Apple' famous high margins, but also becaus India charg more in tax for devic that don't have 30% of their compon sourc in it country. Appl ask for an except from this, but the countri recentlydeniedthat request.Meanwhile,Samsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) smartphon ASP in India is just $173. That mean Apple' phone are253%mor expensive, on average, than Samsung's. Not mani American would pay for that price differ and in India, where wage are substanti lower, it' even harder to convinc consumers.Perhap that price differ is whi Samsung is sit at the top of the smartphon vendor list in India with 26.6% market share, while Appl hold just 1.9%.India'smiddl class is growing, which could eventu help Apple' iPhon sale in the country, but it' not help much right now.Appl know it phone are expens for Indian consumers, and that' whi it recent request to sell refurbish devic in the country. But India ha so far reject that request, which onli add to Apple' problems.Appl doesn't have a choiceTher are few reason whi Appl continu trudg along with it India strategi despit it current position.A I mention earlier, India will becom the second-largest smartphon market, behind China, veri soon. On top of that, Appl is facingslow iPhon salesin the U.S.Th iPhon account for about 65% of Apple' total revenue. So if the compani want to continu use the devic as it main revenu stream, it'll have to look to new market that are grow quickli -- like India.Investor may not want to hear thisEven if Appl doe eventu see an uptick in smartphon sale in India, it' not like that it will experi the same type of success we'v seen for the compani in the U.S. or China.India is a countri with a grow popul and econom position, but the averag yearli incom in India is just under $1,600, accord to the World Bank. No matter what Appl doe strateg to sell iPhones, it can't chang that fact. Appl will have to settl for whatev market share it can scrape togeth until India becom more wealthy.Th problem for Appl is it need to sell more iPhonesnow,but Indian consum just aren't ready.It' not that Appl is wrong in look to India for more smartphon growth, it' just that the iPhone' price tag is essenti an insurmount hurdl right now, and nearli everyth the company' done to chang that hasn't worked.Someth big just happenedI don't know about you, but I alway pay attent when one of the best growth investor in the world give me a stock tip.

The Galaxy S7 and Facebook Could Benefit from Samsung's Newest Device;5/22/2016;"Samsung' Gear 360. Source: Samsung.Samsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) next major product isn't a smartphon or a TV.Late last month, the hardwar giant releas it first virtual realiti camera, the Gear 360, in it home market of Korea, and plan to bring it to the U.S. and Europ in the come weeks. The Gear 360 certainli isn't the first VR camera on the market, but it' far more afford than mani of it rivals, and it should make it possibl for averag consum to creat and share virtual realiti content.makeArticleAd();That should help bothFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and it may even lead to some addit Galaxi S7 sales.A new type of cameraAbout 80% of American now own smartphones, and virtual all are capabl of take pictur and record video. But no modern smartphon can record a video design for VR, and take a VR photo is cumbersom and difficult. If VR is go to emerg as the next great medium, consum will need new sort of camera to creat content.Ent the Gear 360. Resembl a larg golf ball, the devic is equip with two wide-angl lenses. That allow it to take photo and record video across a full 360 degrees. In Korea, the Gear 360 retail for about 400,000 won, or about $340. U.S. and European price ha not been confirmed, but somewher between $300 and $400 seem likely.Oth virtual realiti camera are out there, but most are an order of magnitud more expensive.GoPro' Odyssey retail for about $15,000, for example, while it upcom Omni goe for $5,000. There are cheaper options, such as the Ricoh Theta S and the recent releasedLG360 CAM, but they lack Samsung' reputation, branding, and massiv market budget, and don't feed into Samsung' burgeon VR ecosystem.Acompellingaccessori for the Galaxi S7You won't need a Galaxi S7 to use the Gear 360. It' capabl of work as a stand-alon device. The video and pictur it take can be sent to an intern SD card, and can be transfer to a Window PC and ultim share online. But if you do happen to own a Galaxi S7, it will sync with your handset, allow you to use it as a sort of remot control. Moreover, onc you'v record photo and videos, you'll need some way to view them. Samsung' Gear VR headset stand as the most obviou solution.When Samsung report earn late last month, it said sale of it Galaxi S7 came in stronger than the compani had anticipated. Perhap consum were entic by the phone' waterproof or it microSD card slot, but mani may have been attract by the prospect of experienc VR. To date, Samsung' Gear ha a near monopoli on high-quality, afford VR experiences, as compet headset like Facebook' Oculu Rift retail for mani hundr of dollar and requir more-powerful-than-usu PC to oper properly.Facebook and Googl are commit to VR contentBut ultimately, the compani that could benefit the most from the Gear 360 are Googl and Facebook, as they vie to own the network where VR content will be shared. Last fall, Facebook ad VR support to it News Feed, allow publish partner and user to share 360-degre videos. When a Gear 360 is pair with a Galaxi S7, user can upload the video they'v taken with it directli to Facebook.Google' commit stretch back even further -- it ad support for 360-degre YouTub video earli last year. Earlier thi month, at Googl I/O, the compani announc Daydream, a VR initi that promis to make mani futur Android phone VR compatible. In conjunct with Daydream, Googl will releas a version of the YouTub app design specif for VR headsets. Tradit video could benefit from a more intim view experience, but ad more 360-degre video would make VR YouTub far more compelling.VR headset are far from ubiquitous, but they'r out there. The camera need to make VR content, however, are consider more rare. The Gear 360 may ultim be the most revolutionari new product Samsung releas thi year, help bring VR content creation to the mainstream.There' someth big happen thi FridayI don't know about you, but I alway pay attent when one of the best growth investor in the world give me a stock tip.

Instead of a new smartwatch, Appl offer up some new band and a price cut.Source: AppleHowever, the smart money is on AAPL final take the wrap off theAppl Watchreplac in the fall. Here' what we think we know about the upcom Appl Watch 2.makeArticleAd();Appl Watch S?Will the second-gener Appl smartwatch be the Appl Watch 2, or the Appl Watch S? While the current model is in need of signific upgrades, it' possibl Appl could follow the strategi adopt with the iPhon and make everi other releas an ""S"" version.In that case, the new smartwatch would look ident to the previou model, but incorpor increment improvements.Th 10 Way You Will Watch TV by 2020WithFitbit Inc(FIT) still go strong and make move into the smartwatch space, I think Appl realiz it need to up it game and will skip the ""S"" strategi to releas a full-on Appl Watch 2.ThinnerThere' no deni the fact that the current AAPL Watch is chunky. Look at it profil compar to say, aPebbleTim Round, and it look even heftier. Appl ha alway been obsess with make everyth thinner, so expect design to be work hard to shave a few millimet off the thick of the Appl Watch 2.More Power CPUProb the singl most frustrat thing for the major of Appl Watch owner is it pokey performance. As a watch with notifications, everyth work as expected. Launch an app, however, and be prepar to wait. A more power CPU is high on the must-hav list for thi wearabl to live up to expectations.Cellular ConnectivityTh AAPL Watch reli on an iPhon for much of it functionality. The rumor mill ha been fill with report that Appl may beput a cellular radio in the Appl Watch 2. Do so would let user track distanc use GPS, stream Appl Music, receiv text and e-mail, and make call - without need to carri their iPhone.Samsung(SSNLF) and some other smartwatch maker have alreadi offer thi with limit consum interest, but make it an option featur may win the Appl Watch more fan from the Fitbit crowd.Batteri LifeEveryon complain about Appl Watch batteri life, but the realiti is it' more than enough to get through a day for most peopl and that' good enough. At least for now. If Appl ha ani hope of make the AAPL Watch 2 slimmer and more powerful, someth ha to give.Batteri technolog move slowli and even shave space with a thinner OLE display to add more batteri capac would like be a wash if an overal slimmer case and more power CPU are coming. So, I would not expect to see ani signific improv in batteri life, especi if cellular connect is ad to the mix.Mor BandsAppl ha been pretti open about the fact that the Appl Watch isn't just a devic - it' an accessory. Band have been the big add-on, the rel inexpens way to transform an Appl Watch from a sporti fit tracker to a fashionableHermes(HESAF) timepiece.WhateverAAPL doe with the Appl Watch 2, expect to see a slew of new band releas too.Releas DateTh origin Appl Watch went on sale in April 2015, which madeApple' March eventa like announc point for it replac (assum a one-year product cycl like the iPhone). Obviously, that didn't happen.Most analyst are now expect a fall releas of the AAPL Watch 2, with an announc as part of the annual iPhon event in September. That' a 1.5-year product cycl and perfect time for Appl to drum up excit in time for the holiday shop season.Appl Watch Review: Doe watchO 2 Make it Better?Ther is a possibl we might see the second-gener Appl smartwatch sooner, though.Quanta Computer(QUCPF) manufactur Apple' smartwatch and a senior offici from that compani toldTechRadartheAppl Watch 2 wa expect in Q2 2016. That timefram would line up with June'sWWDC 2016for Appl to make the announcement.Appl Watch 2 PriceAAPL Watch model current have price rang from $299 to $17,000. The compani ha alreadi slash the entry-level price from $349 to $299 and that is actual competit with most full-featur smartwatches.Even though Appl would probabl like to goos Appl Watch 2 sale abov what it' accomplish with the original, it also love it margins. Expect Appl to hold the line, keep price at exist level and push new featur to make the case for buy an Appl Watch 2.A usual with AAPL, we'll have to wait until it final announc it second-gener smartwatch befor ani of these detail are confirmed. There is also no guarante the compani will actual swing that fall release, but the chanc are high enough that I wouldn't be plunk cash down on an origin Appl Watch at thi point, even with that $50 discount.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlacePebble: The First Victim of Appl Inc.'

The compani declin to provid specif S7 and S7 Edg sale data, but analyst estim Samsung ship roughli 10 million unit of it flagship smartphon dure Q1, roughli 30%-40% higher than mani initi forecasts, and put it on pace to do better than previou models.Analyst are quick to note that shipment aren't the same as sale to end consumers, which could mean the current sale total sit lower even than the 10 million estimate. It' also import to point out that the latest smartphon enjoy both time and price advantag compar with past Galaxi devic famili launches.Th compani launch the latest Galaxi model a month earlier than last year' Galaxi S6 and S6 Edge. They also cost slightli less than last year' Galaxi and enjoy new consumer-friendli featur such as highli water-resist case and a slot for addit extern memory.

Are you sens a trend here?Ov the past year, the improv to Apple' suit of iProduct have mostli increment in nature.

Apple Inc. May Fall Behind MediaTek, Qualcomm;5/4/2016;"Imag credit: Apple.Appleha earn quit a lot of prais for it chip-design prowess. Sinc it acquisit of P.A. Semiconductor in 2008, it arguabl ha transform into the lead design of mobile-target applic processors.makeArticleAd();Dur the past two product gener (iPhon 6, iPhon 6s), Appl ha led the transit to new chip-manufactur technologies. Apple' A8 and A8X processor were the first applic processor built onTSMC' 20-nanomet manufactur technology. The Appl A9 wa the first applic processor avail on TSMC' 16-nanomet FinFET Plu technology.It would seem, however, that Appl will not lead the charg into the next chip-manufactur technology: 10-nanometers.MediaTek may be the first to TSMC 10-nanometerTSMC ha said publicli that it expect to begin to see ""sizable"" revenu from it 10-nanomet technolog ""start from 2Q 2017 through 2018."" Thi suggest that TSMC will begin to recogn wafer revenu by the end of the second quarter (June), impli that wafer product should begin roughli three month befor then.Accord to analyst Pan Jiutang (via GSMArena), MediaTek' 2017 flagship Helio X30 will use a 10-nanomet manufactur technology. Given that the Helio X20/25 launch in Q1 2016/Q2 2016, it wouldn't be unreason to expect the X30 to arriv in Q1/Q2 of 2017.It is also expect thatQualcomm' upcom Snapdragon 830 will be built on a 10-nanomet process. (Samsungi believ to build thi chip, though.) The Snapdragon 830 is expect to arriv in earli 2017.The implic for AppleTher are two critic ingredi that defin the qualiti of a chip: the manufactur technolog that it' built on, and the underli architecture. Think of the manufactur technolog as the canvas, while the architectur is the actual painting. All els be equal, a better canva should mean a better painting, but a lousi artist with a great canva isn't go to produc someth as good as a great artist with a mediocr canvas.Apple' architectur are gener superb, so the 16-nanomet FinFET+ A10 chip that will debut thi year in the iPhon 7-seri phone may be abl to keep up in term of perform with the 10-nanomet Qualcomm and MediaTek chips. However, Appl will be tie one hand behind it back, so to speak, becaus the 10-nanomet technolog should allow MediaTek and Qualcomm to pack in more functionality, and deliv better perform than they otherwis would have been abl to on 14-nanometer/16-nanomet FinFET+.With Qualcomm and MediaTek suppli 10-nanomet chip to most of Apple' premium smartphon competitors, Appl risk fall behind in chip power efficiency, and potentially, perform -- depend on the architectur choic from it competitors.It may not be a big deal, but whi should Appl risk it?Som might argu that Appl be approxim four-to-f month behind in transit to a new chip technolog isn't go to be a big deal for most people. However, I would argu that a non-trivi portion of those who purchas premium smartphon care about these sort of things.Additionally, if Appl lose the chip-perform crown midway through the iPhon 7 cycle, the reput for chip-technolog leadership that Appl ha built dure the last three year -- i.e. first to 64-bit, first to 20-nanometer, first to TSMC 16FF+ -- could be damaged.Given all the other area that Appl seem to be behind in these day (display technology, camera quality, etc.), and given how desper Appl need to make sure it iPhon busi return to growth, chip leadership is someth that the compani should strive to maintain.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Is InvenSense Still a Buy?;5/4/2016;"Imag source: Invensense.InvenSense(NYSE: INVN) ha suffer a seri of blow over the past year. The company' stock is down more than 44% over the past 12 months, it motion sensor recent lost a spot inSamsung' (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) flagship Galaxi S smartphon lineup, and slowingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhon sale could hurt the company' revenue.makeArticleAd();Al of that sound pretti bad, and it beg the question whether or not thi beleagu tech stock is still a buy.So let' dissect a few key area of InvenSense' busi to answer that.What' happen with revenue?First, revenu is move in the right direction. It' actual been grow at a pretti healthi clip, year over year, for the past few years. Take a look:Imag source: InvenSense.Fisc 2015 revenu grew 47% year over year, and the year befor that it wa up 21%.So it would appear the company, at least for now, isn't have major revenu issues. But if we take a look at InvenSense' margins, thing don't look as great.Non-GAAP gross margin fell to 44% in FY 2015, down from 51% in 2014. That' the lowest it' been sinc 2009.But thing start to look even wors when we see that InvenSense' oper margin plummet in fiscal 2015 to just 14%, down from 24% in fiscal 2014 -- and way down from the previou five years.Imag source: InvenSense.To be fair, oper margin ha have fallen as InvenSens ha pour money into it R&D expenses. R&D now repres 20% of the company' oper expenses, up from just 11% in fiscal 2013. But that' much higher than the compani want (it' aim for R&D at 13% to 15%) and it' still unclear whether or not the increas in spend will pay off.But there are bigger problemsTh real problem for InvenSens right now is that the compani is tie so close to Appl (InvenSens get about 34% of it total revenu from Apple) that the iPhone' recent sale slowdown could weigh heavili on the company. Contain within the in the iPhon 6s and 6s Plu are InvenSense' 6-axi motion sensors. Slow iPhon sale equal slow sensor sales.Appl report in it fiscal Q2 2016 earn thi month that iPhon sale hadfallen to 51.1 million, down 16% year over year, it first declin ever in iPhon unit sales.If Appl continu to suffer iPhon sale declines, InvenSens won't be abl to resist the neg effect. The company' revenu is simpli too close tie to Apple' smartphone.And then there' the issu of InvenSens lose a spot in Samsung' flagship Galaxi S smartphon lineup. Samsung recent pass over InvenSense' 6-axi sensor for the Galaxi S7. Make no mistake: that wa a big loss. Back in January, InvenSens CEO Behrooz Abdi said that the company' second-largest revenu contributor (which is Samsung) will dip down to a single-digit percentag of revenue. Samsung repres about 19% of InvenSense' total revenue, so the drop is pretti substanti no matter how you slice it.In short, InvenSens is lose lot of busi from two of it biggest customers, and it' unclear where it will make up those losses.Not much to look forward toInvenSense' yearli revenu (for now) is move in the right direction, but gross margin and oper margin are not. Additionally, the compani ha tie it hors to the Samsung and Appl smartphon wagon (both of which are suffer in their own way). InvenSens is tri to expand into new revenu streams, but it' unclear if can adapt fast enough.iPhon sale could certainli turn around, but that doesn't help InvenSens diversifi it revenu stream in the long run. Additionally, Samsung' long been in adownward spiralwith it mobil prospect and that' onli go to continu hurt InvenSense.Aft weigh the evidence, I don't think InvenSens is a buy. The compani sever need to diversifi itself away from Appl and Samsung, and (so far) it doesn't appear to be do that fast enough. Thi fact, coupl with slow phone demand in the present, make the futur look murki at best.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

What to Expect When Universal Display Corporation Reports Earnings;5/3/2016;"Univers Display' lucr OLE materials. IMAG SOURCE: Univers Display.Univers Display Corporationi set to releas first-quart 2016 result thi Thursday, May 5, after the market close. Share of the OLE technologist have rebound nice despit the company'sweaker-than-expect showingin February, with the stock even flirt with all-tim high in recent days. And long investor would love noth more than to sustain that momentum with a solid report to kick off a year that CFO Sid Rosenblatt describ as one ""in which the OLE industri build meaning new capac for the continu prolifer of OLE in the marketplace.""makeArticleAd();But what, exactly, should investor be watch when Univers Display' Q1 report hit the wires?First, as far as headlin number go, Univers Display hasn't provid specif financi guidanc for the first quarter. But it did offer an earli look at the full year, call for 2016 revenu to increas 15% year over year, plu or minu 5%, result in a rang of $208.7 million to $230.6 million. Manag also note that given current manufactur capac buildouts, the major of that growth will occur in the second half of the year.A such -- and with the caveat that we don't lend much credenc to Wall Street' near-term demand -- it should come as no surpris that analysts' consensu estim predict Univers Display will achiev a breakeven quarter as revenu increas a modest 1.1%, to $31.6 million. Investor should also keep in mind that thisdoesn'tinclud one of the biannual licens payment Univers Display receiv fromSamsung Displayin the second and fourth quarter of each year. Altogeth in 2016, Samsung Display' licens payment will total $75 million, up from $60 million in 2015.To that end, Univers Display gener revenu from two segments: royalti and licens fees, which climb 23% year over year last quarter, to $34.4 million (includ $30 million from Samsung), and sale of OLE materials, which fell 1% year over year last quarter, to $27.8 million. Regard the latter, Univers Display blame year-end inventori manag by customers, as well as it product mix weigh toward it lower-pr OLE emitters. In addition, note that there' a one-quart lag in run royalti gener by sale of licens product under Univers Display' long-term patent and licens agreement withLG Display. Consid LG Display previous state roughli 50% of it total OLE TV unit shipment in 2015 were sold in the fourth quarter alon -- and though LG Display' own manufactur effort for these high-end TV is still in it earli stage -- we should see at least some posit impact from that agreement in Q1.I'll also be listen close for color on new and expand licens agreement sign dure the quarter, includ a ""collabor and evalu agreement"" center on OLE light with OSRAM sign in March. Givensimilaragreementssign with the like ofPhilipsand BOE in recent years, we shouldn't expect thi to materi contribut to Univers Display' top or bottom line in the near future. But given thevast potenti for OLE lighting, which is cool to the touch, is highli energi efficient, and afford design the abil to be made in flat, flexibl form factors, it' encourag to see an increas number of supplier demonstr interest in the technology.In addition, listen for ani hint from Univers Display manag thatApplemight be expand it use of OLE beyond ""just"" the display in the Appl Watch -- namely, to it popular iPhon line. A few week ago, variou South Korean news outlet report that Samsung Display hassign a deallast at least three year to suppli around 100 million OLE smartphon screen annual to Appl -- a massiv develop from which Univers Display would obvious benefit, even if it mean further increas it relianc on it largest custom in Samsung Display.At the same time, I don't expect Univers Display manag to comment on the specif plan of Appl or Samsung Display. But I'v been surpris before; After Univers Display' Q1 confer call almost exactli three year ago, for example, Inotedthat CEO Steve Abramson curious point out that Appl had recent file a patent for a wrist-worn OLE display, seemingli foreshadow the Appl Watch. And late last year, Univers Display share rose after Rosenblatt comment that, in hi opinion, an OLE iPhon wasonli a matter of time.Until then, however, Univers Display investor will happili weather a few quarter of sluggish growth, especi if it mean watch the massiv growth stori of Univers Display' flagship technolog continu to unfold.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Why Analysts Disagree About Micron Technology Inc.;5/3/2016;"Imag source: Micron Technology.Among analysts, there' isn't much agreement when it come toMicron Technology. The memory-chip manufactur ha seen it revenu tumbl and it profit disappear as oversuppli in the DRAM and NAND market drove per-bit price down. The stock ha slump along with the company' results, lose nearli two-third of it valu over the past year, and wipe out much of the gain investor enjoy in 2013 and 2014.makeArticleAd();MUdata byYChartsAnalyst price target for Micron stock rang from as low as $8 to as high as $20, a spread that' wider than the current stock price of about $10.50. Whi is there so much disagreement?Th major differenceA coupl of recent upgrad for Micron came from Raymond Jame and Brean Capital, along with price target of $17 and $14, respectively. On the other side, Nomura and Susquehanna downgrad Micron in March. Nomura drop it price target to just $8 per share, while Susquehanna drop it target to $10.Despit the wide gap in price targets, there' realli onli one differ between the bullish analyst and the bearish analysts. The bullish analyst believ that the DRAM industri ha fundament chang becaus of consolidation. There are now onli three major DRAM manufacturers, and the idea is that these compani will attempt to maxim profit instead of gun for market share. Supply-driven cycl may still occur, but they won't be as sever compar to the past.Micron post a $1 billion net loss in fiscal 2012, with price drag down by oversupply. Thi situat eventu correct itself, and in fiscal 2014 Micron earn a whop $3 billion in net profit. The stock soared, trade at a price-to-book ratio of about 3.5, a level not seen sinc the aftermath of the dot-com bubble. Investor were bet that the good time would never end.But even with onli three competitors, high margin didn't last. Micron' profit eventu began to tumble, and dure the latest quarter, the compani post a net loss onc again. The bearish analyst believ that noth ha realli chang in the industry, and Micron' post a loss seem to bear that out, at least to a degree.Samsung, one of the major DRAM manufacturers, never got the memo about maxim profits. The compani ha been aggress go after market share, so much so that Bernstein analyst Mark Newman, onc extrem bullish on the stock, proclaim that Samsung ha ruin for the industri what could have been a period of record profits. Bernstein had a mesmer $45 price target on the stock as recent as June 2015. The firm ha sinc lower that target multipl time to just $10 per share.Micron isn't cut it product either, despit rapidli fall prices. Dure the company' confer call, when ask whether it wa plan on cut output, CEO Mark Durcan responded: ""Well, first of all, we'r not go to do it unless we see neg cash margins, becaus we haven't ad ani increment capacity. And we think we'd be foolish to be the first one to take capac off, given that fact set.""Combin Samsung' aggressiveness, Micron' unwilling to cut production, continu weak demand for PCs, and the first quarterli declin in global smartphon shipments, and you have the make of a deep slump in the memory-chip market.Th bullish analyst still believ that the effect of consolid will ultim win out, but nearli everyth is point in the opposit direction.

2 Beaten Down Apple Inc.

However, the same fundament rule that appli to non-technolog stock appli to technolog stocks: buy and hold high-qual busi for the long-term is often a great way to build wealth.makeArticleAd();In thi column, I'd like to talk about two beaten down tech stock -- supplier toApple, in fact -- that have solid long-term prospect and that tech investor should consid buying:Synaptics, andSkywork Solutions.Synaptics' woe seem temporarySynapt develop what are call ""human interfac solutions"" -- in other words, the technolog implement in modern comput to allow peopl to interact with them. Exampl includ touch control for smartphones/tablets, PC touchpad controllers, pressur sensor technolog for mobil devic (aka 3D Touch), display driver chips, and more.Th stock recent tumbl from north of $85 per share to under $70 per share as a result of a signific revenu miss in it recent quarter and veri ugli forward guidanc ($300-$340 million against consensu estim of $478.6 million).Th miss, accord to CEO Rick Bergman, is attribut to a ""precipit drop in order level within the smartphon market, specif around our display driver customer."" In addit to weak in premium smartphones, PC-relat revenu also came under pressur as a result of the continu weak in the PC market overall.Bergman also note that the compani is take a ""cautiou approach"" to set it guidanc for the fourth fiscal quarter ""in anticip that the level of product current in the suppli chain will be suffici to meet the reduc demand for our display driver product from high-end smartphon OEMs.""Although the pictur look pretti grim in the near-term, there' a solid chanc that thing could rebound in the second half of the calendar year. Apple' upcom iPhon 7-seri launch could help, particularli on the display driver side of things, and manag ha indic that it ha secur mani win for it finger-print sensor as well as it ClearForc technolog (Appl 3D Touch clone).In my view, Synapt is a compani that execut veri well on technolog but is current face a slump due to factor larg outsid it control. If those factor subside, I expect Synaptics' financials, and ultim it stock, to sharpli rebound.A a result, Synapt could be a veri interest buy here for the patient tech investor.Skyworks: revenu growth even if iPhon unit don'tSkywork is a well-known supplier of Radio Frequency, or RF, chip into the smartphon market, as well as into other applications.Th veri interest thing about be an RF chip player is that each year, the complex of the RF technolog requir in smartphon goe up.""Among our top customers, we see complex and increas perform requir drive content expans across the board,"" said Skywork CEO David Aldrich on a recent confer call with analysts.""For example, our overal content onSamsung' flagship Galaxi S7 platform is up 20% versu prior models,"" Aldrich added. He also point to a 40% increas in content within Huawei' ""new flagship smartphon platforms.""Th upshot of thi continu surg in RF content insid of smartphon is that even in an environ in which unit aren't growing, Skywork can still see total revenu growth. There' littl doubt that thi increas in content/complex is help to fuel the company' gross profit margin growth, which Aldrich said came in at up 410 basi point (i.e. 4.1%) year-over-year.A of a recent check, Skywork trade at $67.12 per share, down substanti from it 52-week high of $112.88. On a Gener Accept Account Principl basis, Skywork deliv $4.91 per share in earnings, and I believ over the long-term thi can continu to grow.I think at current levels, Skywork share look compel and could be a veri interest way to play a potenti recoveri in the smartphon market (especi iPhone), particularli sinc it can grow revenu fairli independ of industri unit growth through content growth.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

May Be Losing Smartphone Share to Samsung;5/2/2016;"Imag credit: Apple.DescribingApple' most recent quarterli financi result as ""disappointing"" might just be an understat -- they were downright ugly. Appl report a sharp declin in iPhon unit shipment in it most recent quarter and, as a result of weak demand and a commensur channel inventori adjustment, iPhon unit are expect to drop significantli again in the current quarter.makeArticleAd();Although CEO Tim Cook blame the iPhon declin on a weaker-than-hop upgrad cycl rel to that seen follow the iPhon 6/6 Plu launch as well as broader macroeconom weakness. Cook point to high custom loyalti and record level of Android switcher to iPhon as posit that bode well for the company' iPhon busi over the long term.That be said, I can't help but note that Appl may be lose share to Samsung. Allow me to explain.Look at the year-over-year comparisonsAppl report a drop in iPhon sale from around 61 million to around 51 million in the most recent quarter, a reduct of approxim 16%. In contrast,Samsungreport that sale in it ""Mobile"" group (smartphones, tablets, etc.) were actual up 8% year-over-year in it most recent quarter.For all of 2016, Samsung aim to see a year-over-year increas in the profit of it mobil divis ""through high-end sale growth and solid profit of mid to low-end products.""Apple, in contrast, will have seen iPhon sale flat in fiscal Q1, iPhon down in fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3, with it fiscal Q4 someth of an unknown at thi point, though analyst consensu call for a 9.1% year-over-year drop in total revenue, impli further iPhon unit declines.It' clear that Samsung is see better year-over-year growth than Appl is.I it share gain against Apple, or ...?One potenti explan is that Samsung is simpli regain share in the premium tier of the smartphon market, which Appl dominates, from Apple. In fact, given that the Galaxi S7 seem to have been fairli well receiv and is superior to the current iPhon 6s flagship in a number of key way (display quality, camera, and weight), thi wouldn't be too surprising.However, it' import to note that Appl isn't theonlyplay in the premium tier of the smartphon market (though it is the largest). Samsung may veri well be gain share against other vendor of Android-bas smartphon (i.e. HTC, LG, and so on), which could explain the South Korean consum electron giant' year-over-year growth in mobile.Appl is probabl lose share; iPhon 7 need to be a hitAlthough I doubt that Appl would ever admit it, it seem like that part of the iDevic maker' iPhon woe is due to share loss in the premium tier of the market to the like of Samsung, Huawei, and others.Fortunately, I think that with a strong iPhon 7 show later thi year, Appl ha an opportun to grow it share in the premium portion of the smartphon market. Appl will need to make sure that the iPhon 7 is suffici advanced/compelling, though, to stay relev onc the Android vendor launch their flagship in the middl of the iPhon 7 cycle.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

With extens use of Lycra, rubber and a singl cabl tether it to a PC, the headset is both minimalist and comfort to wear.Set the system up is a question of connect the includ track camera and headset, download a Window app and run through a checklist.Onc up and running, the actual virtual realiti experi is slick. The resolut is higher than in the past, but still low enough that there is some granular - although lag ha been all but elimin and the refresh rate is fast enough that motion sick should be less of an issue.Th singl camera limit the wearer' virtual movement to sever steps, but develop have releas some titl that realli take advantag of thi VR gear. Video game in particular are entertain with titl likeChronosandLucky' Talelead the charge.However, good as the experi is, have to use an Xbox control instead of the Oculu Touch (which isn't releas until later thi year) is a compromis and most titl still feel like experiment adapt from standard game titles. You can see the futur of game with the Oculu Rift, but we'r clearli in earli days.But the Cost…A cool as the VR world creat by the Oculu headset may be, the money requir to make the most of it will bring mani peopl crash back to reality.Th first obstacl is the price of the Oculu Rift itself: $599. That' a lot more than the$350 Oculu hint at befor release, caus a seriou PR problem prior to launch. However, the headset is just the start for mani potenti buyers.Pow the pixel behind that virtual realiti requir some seriou comput muscle. If your PC isn't up to the task -and for mani peopl it won't be - then PC manufactur like Dell are sell ""Oculu Ready"" comput bundl start at $1,500.Then there are the special Touch control expect to be releas later thi year.Al told, the equip requir for the full Oculu Rift VR experi could end up cost well over $2,000.When you compar that to the cost ofMicrosoft Corporation' (MSFT) Xbox One at $350 for the console, a control and a pre-pack game or two, the case get harder to make for buy into Oculu - at least for most consumers.Key SpecificationsSource: Oculu VRTwo 1200 x 1080-pixel OLE displays110 degre field of visionCamera track area 5 feet x 11 feetAccelerometerGyroscopeRemov headphonesBuilt-in micRequir a Window PC with minimum Core i5-4590 CPU equival or greater, 8GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 970/AMD 290 video card equival or greater, 3 x USB 3.0 port (plu one USB 2.0 port), HDMI 1.3 video outputMSRP $599 (includ headset, sensor, remote, Xbox One controller, cabl andLucky' Tale)Oculu Rift Review: ConclusionThere' no question that virtual realiti is hit the mainstream in 2016.

Fast-forward to today, and you'll find share trade around a paltri $8. Sure a bargain is to be had, right? Let' dig in and take a look.First, a littl background on the company' decline. When wearabl technolog and other Internet of Thing tech first hit the market, the sky seem to be the limit for InvenSense. The compani had the market corner on smartwatch motion sensor and wa a major chip supplier forAppleandSamsungsmartphon as well. But competit heat up and maker of wearabl start to diversify.

The company' manag ha issu soft guidanc as smartphon purchas worldwid start to slow, and competit among chipmak for the exist market of IoT devic is fierce. Analyst see FY17 revenu drop by almost 4% and earn drop by over 6%. Investor will no doubt be wait to see where manag guid financi for the new fiscal year, and whether that guidanc exce the current downbeat feel on the Street. InvenSens is schedul to report Q4 earn on May 9.To shop or not to shopWith share price wallow on all the neg PR, should investor call a bottom here and buy in? Let' look at a few valuat metric and compar them with those of InvenSense' industry.MetricInvenSenseIntegr Circuit IndustryPric to sale (trail 12 months)1.71.8Pric to earn (trail 12 months)345.427.1Forward price to earnings17.513.6Five-year expect growth rate (per year)18.3%14.6%Five-year PEG ratio0.950.91Chart data source: Yahoo!

Price to sales, a measur of stock price to total revenue, ha drop below the industri averag as a result of the stock drop, and price to earn is ugly, as compani profit ha drop more steepli than share prices. The pictur go forward look a littl more optimistic, though. Forward price to earn clean up and is onli a littl higher than the industri average, and five-year earn growth estim exceed the industry. As a result, the PEG ratio, which measur the premium paid for futur growth outlook, is in line with peers.Thes figur indic to me that InvenSens is current fairli valued, but these number could chang after we get guidanc from the compani dure the earn releas on May 9. Ignor short-term think and expectations, however, the compani is expect to outperform as far as growth in the year to come.Compani manag plan to execut it growth strategi by diversifi away from smartphones. The compani ha invest so that it technolog now ha applic for wearabl tech such as watch and cameras, drones, and automobiles.

Sure, but that depend on ani forward outlook chang in come months. Is the stock a value? It look to me like it' approach that point if it isn't already, especi when consid the five-year growth potential.

Thi is the first time in year that Appl ha seen a declin in iPhon shipment and even lower price for it devices. A prime reason for thi is stiff competit from the like of SamsungSSNLFand LenovoLNVGY, along with the sluggish demand for iPhon 6s. In addition, the compani will still have to find a way around the market satur in the U.S. and some other import region in order to keep itself on the growth trajectory.Th compani can get some respit after it launch iPhon 7 in the back half of thi year. Meanwhile, Appl is aim to tap a greater share of the market with it budget offer iPhon SE. The compani seem especi optimist about emerg nation like India where the scope for growth is high.Apple' servic busi is also expect to remain strong as it is mostli depend on the alreadi instal Appl devic and the compani doe have a loyal custom base. Also, in the long run, Appl is expect to benefit from it robust cash position, strength in technolog and the ecosystem (Appl Watch and Appl Pay) that it ha built.

Is Qualcomm Inc. Stock a Buy After Earnings Beat?;4/27/2016;"Share ofQualcommheld steadi after the mobil chipmak beat second-quart earn estim on both the top and bottom line last week. Non-GAAP revenu fell 20% annual to $5.54 billion, but beat expect by $200 million. Net incom fell 34% to $1.6 billion, while dilut earn (boost by buybacks) fell 26% to $1.04 per share -- which still exceed estim $0.08.Imag source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Chipmak (QCT) revenu fell 19% to $3.34 billion, as the unit' oper profit plung 77% to $170 million. That declin wa mainli attribut to slow sale of smartphones, the loss of market share to rival likeMediaTek, and OEM likeSamsungandHuaweiproduc their own mobil chips.Licens (QTL) revenu declin 12% to $2.14 billion as oper profit fell 14% to $1.86 billion. That declin wa caus by lower licens fee in China caus by underreport shipments. Let' dig beyond those number to understand the posit and neg aspect of Qualcomm' report, and whether investor should buy shares.First, the good newsTh first piec of good news is that Qualcomm ha dealt with it licens disput in a time manner. It announc that it royalti disput withLG, which wa reveal dure the first-quart earn call, wa settl for an undisclos amount. It also continu secur new patent licens deal with Chines OEM likeXiaomi,Lenovo, andHiSense. These move might prevent it QTL loss from accelerating, but investor should note that other licens disput with South Korean, Taiwanese, and European regulatorsremain unresolved. However, Qualcomm declar dure it confer call that QTL revenu could rise to ""greater than $10 billion"" in fiscal 2020 -- up from a rang between $7.3 billion and $8 billion thi year.MSM (mobil station modem) chip shipment fell 19% annual to 189 million, but that figur wa closer to the high end of it previou guidanc for 175 million to 195 million shipments, thank to shipment of the Snapdragon 820 for Samsung' Galaxi S7. Qualcomm expect the same 175 million to 195 million shipment for the current quarter, which would repres a 13% to 22% annual decline. Those figur leav much to be desired, but they indic that sale of new Snapdragon chip will like prevent QCT revenu from fall off a cliff thi year.Now, the bad newsTh bad news is that total 3G/4G devic sales, which alreadi fell 8% annual to $70.1 billion, are expect to keep falling. Devic sale for the current quarter are expect to fall 1% to 14% annually. For the full year, Qualcomm lower it devic shipment forecast from a 1.67-1.77 billion rang to 1.625-1.725 billion -- which would repres a rang between an 11% annual declin and 5% growth.Thos figur are slightli belowGartner' estim that global smartphon sale will onli rise 7% thi year, compar to 14% growth in 2015. Competit from cheaper rival and first-parti chip solut will make it even tougher for Qualcomm to keep pace with the overal market. To offset that slowdown, Qualcomm is reli on new SoC for Internet of Thing devices, connect cameras, connect cars, and drone to diversifi it portfolio away from smartphon and tablets. That move, which is support by it $2.4 billion acquisit of CSR, could crush smaller camera and drone chipmakerslikeAmbarella.Qualcomm' Snapdragon Flight drone refer design. Imag source: Qualcomm.Th fundamentalsI believ that three thing will set a floor under Qualcomm at current price -- it buybacks, dividends, and valuation. Dure the quarter, Qualcomm spent $1.5 billion to buy back share at an averag price of $49 per share. That wa a refresh chang of pace fromoverpay for it own sharesin previou quarters, and indic that it' will to defend the $50 level with buybacks.It also spent $700 million on dividends, and boost it payout by 10% in March -- repres it 13th consecut year of dividend increases. That translat to a forward annual yield of 4%, which is significantli higher thanIntel' forward yield of 3.3%. Analyst expect Qualcomm to grow it annual earn by 11% over the next five years, which give it a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.1. Thi indic that Qualcomm is cheaper rel to it earn growth potenti than Intel, which ha a higher 5-year PEG ratio of 1.3.So is Qualcomm stock a buy?Investor look for rapid price growth should avoid Qualcomm, sinc it QTL and QCT troubl won't like clear up anytim soon. However, investor look for a stabl incom stock support by a 4% yield and a strong track record of buyback should take a closer look at the beaten-down chipmaker.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Why TSMC Is Likely to Win the 2017-2019 Apple Inc. iPhone Chip Business;4/26/2016;"The iPhon 6s came with either a Samsung or a TSMC built processor. Imag credit: Apple.It ha been wide report thatAppleha chosenTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd, commonli refer to as TSMC, to manufactur it next gener A10 processor. Although there have not been report around whether the Taiwan-bas chipmak ha won Apple' next gener A11, A12, and A13 business, I believ it will.makeArticleAd();I will also go a step further and argu that not onli will TSMC be ""loop in"" for the A11 and A12, but I believ that TSMC will win those processor exclusively. Here' why.Th 10-nanomet A11Accord TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu on the company' fourth quarter earn call, TSMC intend to start the 10-nanomet node with ""a veri high market share"" and the compani ""intend[s] not to lose it."" I suspect thatQualcommwil go withSamsungexclus at the 10-nanomet node, so in order for TSMC to have ""veri high"" share, it' probabl necessari for it to win virtual all of the Appl busi at thi node.Th 7-nanomet A12, A13TSMC ha made it clear that it intend to go into mass product on what it refer to as the 7-nanomet node in the first half of 2018. Thi technolog is expect to deliv improv performance/pow consumpt over the 10-nanomet node while at the same time deliv a roughli 1.6x improv in logic density.A Samsung rep, on the other hand,toldEETimesthat ""10 [nanometer] will be a much longer node than other foundri are claim it will be. We think 7 [nanometer] ha to be defin and optim to be cost effect to the masses, not just the high margin products.""It is like that Samsung' ""10-nanometer"" and TSMC' ""10-nanometer"" node will be compar in term of transistor area (TSMC reportedli claim that it 10-nanomet will be denser, though).Interestingli Samsung seem to be plan for two variant of 10-nanometer, one known as 10LPE (an earli version with lower performance) and 10LPP (a later one with greater performance). I suspect that Samsung will transit to 10LPP by the time TSMC move to 7nm. Even if Samsung match TSMC' 7-nanomet in transistor perform with a move to 10LPP, TSMC should have significantli lower transistor area, allow chip design to pack more into a given chip footprint.Thi appar technolog superior on TSMC' part in the 2018-2019 time-fram lead me to believ that Appl will choos TSMC for both the A12 and the A13.If I'm right, thi is good for TSMCAppl bring a lot of volum to the table, and if TSMC can captur the bulk of, if not all of, it, then TSMC should have a ""guaranteed"" larg custom for it latest manufactur technolog for sever year to come. Thi should allow the compani to more confid invest in research and develop for futur technolog beyond even the 7-nanomet node.Th research and develop spend requir to fund futur technolog is onli go to go up from here, which mean that the financi bar to continu fund futur technolog will onli continu to go up. My view is that TSMC should be set for the forese future, but Samsung Foundri -- even though it appear to have it own captiv volum andQualcomm' volum -- is on shaki ground.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

The long-term target, he point out, is ""20%-plus.""makeArticleAd();Aft these claims, Mollenkopf made the follow statement:""It is import to note that for plan purposes, both our near-term and long-term margin target have consist factor in a rang of second sourc assumpt at our larg customers, and we believ our margin target are achiev under those scenarios.""Thi is hardli as direct as the statement that Qualcomm made in earli 2015, when it announc that it would not be in theSamsungGalaxi S6/Note 5. That said, these statement have led mani to believ that Qualcomm ha confirm that it will lose some share toIntelinsid the upcom iPhon 7-seri phones.Should investor now assum that Intel ha definit won a spot insid the next-generationAppleiPhone? Let' take a closer look.It seem veri possibleAt thi point, Appl ha certainli lock down the specif of the iPhon 7, and the build of compon for the phone, if they'r not alreadi under way, should begin shortly. The fact that Qualcomm chose to remind investor that it ha ""consist factor in a rang of second sourc assumptions"" at major customersnowi a pretti big clue that the compani see veri real potenti for share loss at Apple.Ani clue from Intel itself?Sinc Intel is the compani that' expect to be the ""second source"" here, it' worthwhil to see if Intel itself offer ani clue as to whether it ha won thi business.Comb through the comment that Intel manag made on it April 19 call about the mobil business, I wasn't abl to find anyth that realli strongli hint at such a win. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich did say that ""mobil is absolut continu to grow for us as a segment"" and claim that profit in thi segment is improving.CFO Staci Smith ad some addit color, note that both product-level gross margin improv as well as cost cut will contribut to the improv in mobil oper margin thi year.Win roughli 30% (a rumored) of the Appl iPhon busi isn't like to do wonder for Intel' mobil efforts, but given how unsuccess it ha been to date, everi littl bit should help the compani achiev it goal of improv mobil oper profit by (at least) $800 million.Watch for the tear-downsAppl is expect to launch it next gener iPhon in Septemb 2016, so keep an eye out for tear-down then; Appl is unlik to name the vendor(s) of the modem in it phones, nor is it like to allow those vendor to directli speak about design win in the next iPhone. Note that mani of the tear-down site are base in North America, and it' like that ani iPhon model purchas in that region are like to use Qualcomm modems, if onli for CDMA support, which Intel modem lack.An Intel modem is more like to be found insid smartphon target emerg market in which CDMA support is unimportant.

Qualcomm, Inc.: QCOM Slump Not a Red Flag for Apple Inc.

But after listen to the QCOM call, I realiz that the weak in the smartphon suppli chain may not be as big a drag on AAPL' margin as some seem to think.makeArticleAd();AAPL, QCOM and Smartphon QuestionsQualcomm stock sharehold shudder to hear the compani warn that mobil station modem (MSM) chip shipment in the current quarter are track 13%-22% below last year' levels. Sinc these MSM chip are use in higher-end phones, it' no surpris that smartphon sale have been downtrending.And becauseSamsung(SSNLF) and AAPL domin the high end of that market, weak for QCOM rais question around the manufacturers. After all, it' hard to reconcil a two-digit drop in compon shipment with continu strength for the compani that need those chip to sell phones.7 Stock to Buy Befor Summer ArrivesBut while manag wasn't exactli eager to name name dure the earn call, it wa easi to read between the lines. CEO Steven Mollenkopf told us that one ""premium-ti ecosystem"" ha slow it upgrad ramp. That' obvious AAPL, where less intens innov through the iPhon 6 cycl ha curb consumers' appetit to buy an increment better phone ahead of the iPhon 7 launch.Mollenkopf also admit that AAPL' slow ramp trigger a ""slight"" downturn in QCOM' global shipment numbers, but we knew about that already. We can see the sale trend written on theAppl stockchart itself: down more than 4% in the fourth quarter of 2015.And yet, manag wa rel cheeri throughout the call, talk about how QCOM' product mix wa move toward smaller volum of more power chip for higher-end phones. Overall, the compani is becom less of a mass-market supplier and increasingli alli to manufactur that focu on big price point and ultim more profit devices. That' the AAPL strategi at it core.Th real eleph in the room is it other major customer, Samsung, which QCOM admit is creat ""a signific delta"" in the year-over-year trends.That' actual not a shock: Samsung opt about a year ago to swap it own chip into the socket QCOM previous filled, take it phone out of the equation. While a few Galaxi model have ad QCOM back into the build, the absenc of that huge slice of the smartphon univers is probabl the factor prompt the double-digit MSM chip decline.But none of that is a red flag for AAPL. The smartphon univers is not collapsing, as far as QCOM can see. Overal volum are cool a littl - the compani now expect 4% to 10% growth in global phone sale thi year, down from a 7% to 13% target three month ago - but there' no cliff in those numbers.Smartphon have been a tale of two market for year now. There' AAPL and Samsung share the high end, and then there' everyon else.QCOM lost one of those partner on the high end, so we should expect some eros there.But the next gener of iPhon will hit consum soon enough, and both Appl stock and Qualcomm stock will continu to surg forward as they have been.Hilari Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stock Under $10,High Octan Trader,Absolut Capit ReturnandValu Authority.

Things Could Get Even Worse for Fitbit Stock If Apple Makes This Move;4/23/2016;"Imag source: Fitbit.A if thing weren't alreadi look bleak forFitbit-- it' stock is down more than 40% over the past 12 month -- it appear they could get even wors ifApplestart move down-market to more basic wearabl devices.That' what analyst from Pacif Crest believ will happen (first reportedon Barron's), and there' some sound logic behind their speculation. Firstly, the analyst argu that Appl is alreadi deepli commit to the wearabl technolog market, and for that veri reason it' like Appl will eventu releas differ type of wearabl devic -- just as there are differ iPads, Macs, and iPhones.makeArticleAd();Secondly, they say there' a definit demand for wearabl tech, but not necessarili for the featur of the Appl Watch. They said that ""... consum appear to prefer a simplifi and rel inconspicu version of technolog that collect inform while leav complex interact to devic that are better suit for the task.""Th evid of thi come from sale of the Appl Watch in 2015, which were estim at 10 million. Meanwhile, Fitbit sold 21 million fit trackers, and total wearabl sale were 78 million in the same year. That show that despit Apple' larg user base, branding, and marketing, it still doesn't grab the lion' share of the wearabl market.But that could chang soon.Appl unlik to stopHow about the Appl iTracker?OK, I just made that name up, but the idea is that Appl could add anoth wearabl tech devic into the mix, and clobber the competition.Already, the Appl Watch made somehug gainson Fitbit in the eight month after it launched, and the iMak could bring down Fitbit even further if it decidedli enter the basic fit tracker market.A cheaper Appl wearabl devic would put it in even more direct competit with Fitbit' more basic offerings, and allow Appl the opportun to target user who want a fit tracker or basic wearable, without shell out $300 (or more) for a high-end Appl Watch.And at thi point it seem nearli inevit that Appl will move in thi direction. Use Fitbit as an example, the compani recent tri to expand it own wearabl market share by releas the Blaze smartwatch. That give Fitbit a bigger wearabl footprint than Apple.Samsungha made a similar move to expand it wearabl reach across multipl price segments.Grab a $40 billion marketAppl doesn't want to leav ani money on the tabl in the wearabl market, and stubbornli stay in just the high-end smartwatch segment would do that.Th overal wearabl market will be worth $40 billion by 2020, and 320 million unit are forecast to be ship that year, accord toIHS. That' simpli too big of a market for Appl to limit itself to just smartwatches.Research firm IDCrec wrotethat there' room in the wearabl space for both smartwatch and fit trackers:Whil there ha been clear growth in the wearabl market, there ha been littl sign of product cannibalization. Smart watch have drawn increas attent to the market from the like of Apple, Motorola, Pebble, and Samsung, but thi ha not dampen interest in fit trackers.And thi leav plenti of room for Appl to enter the market without hurt sale of it smartwatch.A new, cheaper Appl fit tracker could act as an introductori devic to get Appl user who aren't alreadi into wearabl tech hook on the concept.

But if the newest report from Taiwan' TrendForc is correct, iPhon shipment are not just drop -- they'r cratering.A drop of 31%?Accord to TrendForce, Appl is expect to report it ship 42 million iPhon unit in the first quarter (Apple' second fiscal quarter). For most phone vendors, 42 million high-end unit would be a great year but Appl is no ordinari company. In last year' correspond quarter Appl report ship 61.2 million units. TrendForc estim Appl ship 31% fewer unit on a year-on-year basis. If correct, Appl appear well on it way to an underwhelm earn report.Trendforce' report is bad news all around for Apple.

2 Causes for Concern Ahead of Apple's Earnings Report;4/22/2016;"Source: AppleApple' earn report on Monday figur to be a histor one, though for all the wrong reasons.makeArticleAd();Amid a slow market for smartphon and tablets, the world' largest publicli trade compani is expect to report it first year-over-year revenu contract in more than a decade. Wors yet, a number of recent data point from within Apple' supplier ecosystem have indic that the weaken demand for it ware may be more sever than wa previous thought.Suppli troubleLast week, Appl supplierTaiwan Semiconductorforecast second-quart sale well below analysts' expectations. The culprit? Fall sale in the smartphon and person comput markets, which will crimp demand for the chip the firm produces. All told, Taiwan Semiconductor believ it sale in the current quarter will be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion, roughli 5% below the $7.0 billion analyst had previous forecast.For those unfamiliar with Taiwan Semiconductor, it' the world' largest third-parti semiconductor manufactur . Along with smartphon rivalSamsung, it partner with Appl to help produc the A-seri chip that power it variou mobil devices. (Intelchip power Apple' Mac lineup.)Though Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't publicli disclos precis how much it sell to whom, analyst estim Appl account for roughli 16% of it revenue, so the soft sale forecast predict led to specul that the caus wa slow demand for iPhones, which could mean more troubl in Apple' current quarter.And Taiwan Semiconductor isn't the onli Appl supplier about which report of soften demand have been made recently.L last week, Japanes news outletNikkei Asian Reviewpublish an articl claim that weaken demand for the current iPhon lineup ha led Appl to slash order from a host of it suppliers. Specifically, the articl assert that Appl decreas it compon order fromJapan Display,Sharp,Toshiba, andSonybi as much as 30% in it fiscal second quarter, for which Appl will report earn on Monday. Wors yet,Nikkei Asian Reviewalso claim that demand for Apple' smartphon ha remain depress into it current quarter. So just how concern should Appl investor find thi news?Th bigger pictureRead these reports, it' hard not to find the situat at least somewhat alarming. The iPhon account for 66% of Apple' fiscal 2015 revenue, and like a higher percentag of the Mac maker' profits. Given that, Apple' guidanc on Monday could well disappoint the market, a result that can weigh heavili on ani stock. However, it' also import to rememb that the weaken demand could also prove to be a symptom of iPhon demand shift from one quarter to another, rather than disappear altogether.Appl will all but assuredli refresh the iPhone' form factor with the iPhon 7, which is expect to be releas thi fall. At thi point, the iPhon product cycl ha becom so well-establish that consum shop for new smartphon could ration wait to upgrad their handset until the new design reach the market. Unfortunately, it isn't clear that custom postpon their purchas until the iPhon 7' releas are the drive forc behind the declin in iPhon sales.For example, rival devic like Samsung' Galaxi S7 and S7 Edg are appar be gener well-receiv by the market. What' more, evid of a broader slow of growth among premium handset could point to a matur market or longer upgrad cycl becom increasingli common in the market in general. It isn't clear how robust ani of these trend are or to what degre they could impact Appl specifically. Either way, they certainli deserv consider ahead of Apple' upcom earn releas after the market close Monday.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Will An All-Glass AMOLED iPhone Boost Apple Inc. Stock?;4/22/2016;"Share ofApplehav fallen 14% over the past 12 month due to concern that sale of the iPhone, it top sourc of revenue, will peak thi year. iPhon sale inch up just 1% annual last quarter, and Apple' guidanc for a 9% to 14% sale declin for the current quarter indic that demand wa dri up.A recent report from Trendforc claim that global iPhon shipment fell nearli 24% annual dure the first quarter, and the firm warn that the new 4"" iPhon SE will ""face sever price competit from Chines brand products"" in it target mid-rang market.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Apple.A a result, Appl face tremend pressur to make major technolog and cosmet improv to futur iPhones. But recent leak indic that thi year' iPhon 7 will look similar to the iPhon 6s, and that it biggest improv could be a dual-camera setup for better pictures.But look further ahead, KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believ that Appl will dramat alter the iPhon next year by replac it aluminum chassi with an all-glass enclosure, and replac it LCD screen with an AMOL one. Would such an eleventh-hour move reviv interest in the iPhone?I Appl run out of ideas?If Kuo' report is accurate, Appl would be follow Android devic design trends.Samsungha use AMOL display ever sinc the Galaxi S1, and it ad curv glass screen to the Galaxi S6 Edg last year.Xiaomi,Oppo,Lenovo, and mani other OEM have also produc phone with glass back or all-glass exteriors. Appl also use glass back with the iPhon 4 and 4s. Those stylish handset were prone to crack, but Kuo believ that Appl will use tougher glass to address that issue, and that glass would be ideal for wireless charg and boost reception.Introduc an all-glass AMOL iPhon might impress diehard Appl fans, but it also seem to be an admiss that Android OEM -- which were onc consid ""iPhon knockoff"" maker -- are now move ahead of the design curve. Appl could potenti add it patent and long-rumor ""wraparound"" display design to the all-glass exterior, butLGalso recent won a similar patent, indic that it might launch such a futurist devic befor Apple.All-glass phones: Lenovo' S850 (L) and Oppo' A31 (R). Imag source: Compani websites.Appl is tread water...Und CEO Tim Cook, Appl tread water more often than it swim forward. Cook ha tri use a scattergun strategi to boost iPad sales, ad smaller and larger screen size along with keyboard for product purposes. Yet those tactic seem unlik to break the tablet' eight consecut quarter of annual sale declines.That strategi is now bleed over to the iPhone, caus the compani to launch 4-inch devic to reach untap markets. That strategi might work if Appl lower the price to around $100 for develop and emerg markets, but the compani stubbornli set the price at $400 to $500, keep it out of reach of those consumers.Accord to analyt firm Mixpanel, onli 24% of iPhon user own an iPhon 6s or 6s Plus, while 43% still use the iPhon 6 or 6 Plus. That big dispar indic that mani iPhon 6 users, unimpress by the iPhon 6s' increment upgrades, simpli stuck with their ""good enough"" devices. The iPhon 7 could suffer the same fate if it doesn't offer game-chang improvements. Sinc most carrier no longer subsid iPhon with two-year contracts, longtim iPhon user will like hold onto their devic a bit longer -- which could caus iPad-lik sale declines.But can it swim forward?Appl know that it need to diversifi away from the iPhone, which gener nearli 70% of it revenu last quarter. However, new effort like Appl Pay, Appl Music, and the Appl Watch still account for single-digit percentag of it top line, while therumor ""Appl Car"" probabl won't arriv until 2019. Sale of iPad and Mac have also been sluggish due to ongo declin in both the tablet and PC markets.So until Apple' other busi start gener more meaning sales, all eye will remain fix on the iPhone, which is run out of way to win over new users. I believ that the compani is gradual fall behind Samsung and other OEM in term of hardwar design, and introduc an all-glass AMOL iPhon might not be enough to close the gap next year.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Should you Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?;4/20/2016;"From Januari to mid-February, the S&P 500 lost over 10% of it value. Sinc then, the market ha recov it losses, and the S&P 500 is current up 3.5% year-to-date. Apple'sAAPLshar price ha mimick a similar story, and it stock ha been in line with the market' up and down so far in 2016. However, thi could all chang on the 25thof April.On thi day, Appl will be report it second quarter earn of fiscal 2016. How will Appl perform, and can it differenti itself from the broader stock market?Appl gener 68% of it revenu from the iPhon last quarter. It' worth note that in 2015, the iPhon gener 66.3% of the company' revenues. There is a lot of depend on thi singl product to drive growth for the company. Thismak the compani more riski to invest in, which is part of whi Appl is trade at a low forward PE multipl of 11.98.Apple' iPhon sale are stagnat in term of growth, so investor are wait to see if the compani can bring forth a new growth driver. Appl Pay seem intriguing, but there' no tell as to how big it will get at thi point. Appl Pay is a great product, but one must rememb that the mobil payment space ha other big participants, such as SamsungSSNLFand GoogleGOOGL. Thi new spacewil continu to see other competitor rise, increas the risk of peopl move away from Appl Pay.Appl is also expos to the harshcondit in the macroeconom environment. Global volatil contribut toward whi sale are project to decreas by 3.58% thi year. Appl gener 60% of it sale outsid of the America in 2015, and China is the company' next growth frontier. The Chines are do what they can to keep up with growth expectations, but they are faltering. In spite of prop up equiti market with fund and devalu the Yuan (China' currency), growth concern continu to linger.Earn estim revis have been mix for thi quarter. In the last 60 days, there have been six earn estim revis by financi analysts. Two revis were made upwards, while the other four were revis downwards. Thi ha push our EP consensu estim down over the last 90 days. Three month ago, our earn consensu estim earn of $2.20 per share thi quarter. Now, we estim earn of $1.97 thi quarter.Bottom LineAppl ha beaten our EP in each of the last four quarters, and there' a good chanc that thi quarter won't be an exception. However, each earn beat ha been quit modest over the last year. Appl onli beat our EP consensu by 1.23% last quarter. Even if the compani doe beat on our bottom line consensu estimate, there are some unapp fact which can't be overlooked.Appl is veri reliant on it iPhone, and there ha been no clear sidekick to help in diversifi the company' revenues. iPad sale have been inconsistent, and the Mac ha not been a superb growth candidate, either. When you add in the fact that 60% of the company' sale are outsid of the Americas, it becom pretti clear that the compani could make for a riski bet. The volatil in 2016 will definit impact the world' willing to pay for premium product from Apple.Th cell phone market is grow more and more competit by the year. Will Appl be abl to differenti the iPhon from it competitors' phone over the long run? Will someon els ever make a better phone than the Apple's? If the compani ever get ani of these question wrong, it share price will be decimated. You don't want to be around when/if that happens, and I can't recommend the stock unless it ha proven itself with a new product capabl of properli diversifi the company' sales. Appl is a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).Th Zack Rank is a truli marvel trade tool. Our rank system ha beaten the S&P 500, yield an averag return of 25% per year for the last 29 years!

BlackBerry's Next Smartphone Will Be a Lot Cheaper;4/20/2016;"BlackBerri PRIV. Imag source: BlackBerry.BlackBerryi sell fewer and fewer smartphones.makeArticleAd();Th Canadian phone maker recogn revenu on 3.2 million handset in it last fiscal year, which end in February. That' down from 7 million in the same period 12 month earlier. As a percentag of total revenue, hardwar slip from 42.9% to 40%. Dure it fourth quarter, BlackBerry' handset sale contract to just 600,00 units, down from 1.3 million devic in the same quarter last year.Thi come in the wake of a major transit in BlackBerry' handset business. Late last year, BlackBerri launch the PRIV, it first smartphon power byAlphabet' Android oper system. Unfortunately, the handset seem to have fallen short of management' expectations. On BlackBerry' earn call earlier thi month, CEO John Chen admit that the compani would chang it strategi go forward.Ask for far too muchIn the U.S., the BlackBerri PRIV retail for around $700 -- about the same price as a standard Android flagship, such asSamsung' Galaxi S7 andLG' G5. But it' not 2007 anymore: Although BlackBerri pioneer the smartphon market, it isn't as establish as it now far more domin rivals, particularli in the Android space. Moreover, the PRIV doesn't offer particularli impress value. It hardwar keyboard is certainli unique, but the rest of it spec and it processor are downright pedestrian or even modest compar to it competitors.It isn't particularli shocking, then, that the Priv fail to take the world by storm. There were other factors, to be certain -- the Priv suffer from limit carrier support and a sluggish rollout. (""Unfortunately, contract negoti took longer than plan with certain major carriers,"" Chen said dure the company' earn call.) Still, it brought question valu to a crowd smartphon market.""[Th Priv has] done reason well in the [Unit States]. We'v done reason well...in Canada, in Hong Kong, in major metro citi like in Singapor and so forth,"" Chen said. As for emerg markets? ""Becaus of the tier of the PRIV and it' a pretti high-end product, it tend to be more of the develop economies.""Wil a $400 Android phone fare much better?Chen fundament believ that the PRIV is a solid product, but suffer from a poor price point. He believ the compani could sell far more PRIV were it price more aggressively:On of the problem that we ran into in the last quarter, peopl [do] like our PRIV, but there' a much more limit audienc [for high-end smartphones], and that particular market, that segment seem to be quit satur at thi point. So peopl would love PRIV but it would be a move down one level in price point, and so we'r look to address that.Later, in an interview withTh National, Chen wa more specific:Th fact that we came out with a high-end phone wa probabl not as wise as it should have been...A lot of enterpris custom have said to us, 'I want to buy your phone but $700 is a littl too steep for me. I'm more interest in a $400 device.'In January, Chen said the compani plan to releas one or two new Android devic in 2016. It seem like that they'll price far more afford than last year' PRIV. But will that be enough to jump-start BlackBerry' handset business? Befor it move to Android, BlackBerri wa offer someth uniqu in the form of an integr hardware-softwar platform that emphas secur and a physic keyboard. It move to Android did away with it proprietari software; now, Chen seem to be emphas secur abov all else.""Our valu proposition, that is to offer the most secur Android smartphon for the enterprise, is actual quit strong,"" he said on the earn call. ""We'r the onli peopl who realli secur Android, take the secur featur of BlackBerri that everyon know us for and make it more reachabl for the market,"" he told The National.It' somewhat troubl that the PRIV' price point would be a problem among enterpris customers, perhap the singl group of buyer best abl to absorb greater costs. In a report releas last year, Good Technolog (a compani BlackBerri ha sinc acquired) note that the iPhon 6 wa the singl most popular smartphon among enterpris custom dure the first quarter of 2015, and that Samsung' Galaxi S5 wa the most popular Android phone. At the time, both handset retail for upward of $600.Either enterpris demand for high-end handset just isn't what it onc wa just 12 month ago, or BlackBerry' handset are face much more press problem than price.""If we cannot make money on the devic business...then I will have to get out of that particular business,"" Chen said.A quickli as it arrived, Alphabet could be down a hardwar partner.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Bad News for Apple and Samsung: Mobile Phone Upgrade Cycles Are Slowing;4/20/2016;"Not that long ago it wasn't unusu for most us to impati wait for our two-year cell phone contract to pass so that we could upgrad to the latest phone. We'd head down to the nearest wireless carrier store and scope out the new phones, hope that mayb we were elig for an earli upgrade.But those day are larg over, accord to new inform fromCitigroup.American now take an averag of 29 month to upgrad their cell phone, up from 28 month at the end of last year, and an increas of 24 to 26 month that wa typic just a coupl of year ago, as note in a recentWal Street Journalarticle.And just four year ago, the upgrad cycl wa just 22 months.makeArticleAd();T-Mobile(NASDAQ: TMUS),Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) andAT&Tar larg to blame for the change. Ever sinc T-Mobil ditch two-year servic agreements, Verizon and AT&T eventu follow suit (a didSprint,befor it brought them back) and that' given consum a clear perspect on exactli how much they'r realli pay for their devices.Onc they caught a glimps of the real price of the devic they use -- as oppos to it be hidden in a subsid cell phone contract -- they'v decid to hold onto their phone just a bit longer.For the most part, thi isn't all that bad for wireless carriers. Verizon' Chief Financi Offic Fran Shammo said last month that there wasn't ani profit from devic sale anyway becaus all the carrier sold the phone at cost.But if user are take longer to upgrad their phones, it' clear that thi could be a problem for two of the biggest smartphon makers,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF).Both compani now have their ownyearli smartphon upgrad plans, which allow custom to pay the compani directli for their devic each month, choos ani of the four U.S. wireless providers, and then trade in their smartphon everi 12 month for the latest model.Pip Jaffrayanalyst Gene Munstersaid back in Februarythat he believ Appl ha alreadi sold about 250,000 iPhon through it upgrad program, which could definit be consid a success given that it debut not too long ago. But Munster made a predict that the iPhon upgrad program would also lower the device' upgrad cycle, which appear unlik now.Originally, Munster thought the program would reduc the averag iPhon user' upgrad time frame from 22 month to onli 15 months. But that 15 month time frame would mean iPhon user would be upgrad their phones14 monthsearli than the averag American, base on Citigroup' new data. And with Apple' iPhon sale current slowing, that quick upgrad time seem even more unlikely.And as for Samsung...It' a been a rocki road for Samsung' smartphon busi over the past year or so. The Galaxi S6 fizzl without much fanfare, and left even the most die-hard Samsung fan disappointed. Sentiment seem be turn back to Samsung with the recent releas of the new Galaxi S7, but the earli posit report may have come from theaggress promot activity, and not true consum demand.If demand is weak (or weakening) for the S7 shortli after it launch, then longer upgrad cycl are certainli not welcom news for Samsung. It upgrad program is just a few month old, so we'll have to wait a bit longer to find out if it' help to drive sale -- but at thi point it doesn't sound like investor should hold their breath for that.What these compani realli needTh CEO of AT&T' entertain group, John Stankey, may have put it best at an investor confer last month. Stankey said that smartphon are becom more like the former PC market, ""where ultim over time you saw more virtual of servic occur and there wa less of a burn need to get into the upgrad cycl for the next new chip and the next new OS to gain access to it."" Basically, there aren't enough great new smartphon featur to justifi frequent upgrades.If Appl and Samsung want consum to return the glori day of short upgrad cycles, then the tech compani need to offer up devic that help forc their hand. And that' start to look harder to accomplish than ever before.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc.: Why Would Apple Overhaul the iPhone AGAIN?;4/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn Sunday, Mac news site began publish a report by KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggest thatAppl Inc.(AAPL) is look to switch to anall-glass iPhon in 2017.Source: Brad MoonIf the report hold up, thi would be a massiv move, consid Appl switch to an aluminum case design after the iPhon 4s. When itreleas the iPhon 5 in 2012, the aluminum design wa one of the headlin featur of the new iPhone.makeArticleAd();Sinc then, other smartphon manufactur have been play catch-up.Numer compani ditch their plastic case in an effort to match the premium aluminum and glass look of the Appl iPhone. EvenSamsung(SSNLF) adopt the metal look with the Galaxi S6, abandon the Galaxi smartphones' signatur polycarbon shell and lose key featur like it remov batteri in the process.Appl iPhone: From Glass and Back AgainAft build up aluminum as the ideal premium materi for smartphones, whi would Appl abandon the metal for a new iPhone? And whi would it go back to glass, of all materials? After all, the compani had to endur a period of neg public when the all-glass iPhon 4 wa releas and turn out to bemuch more prone to breakingthan previou models.Well, here are a few reason I can think of:With iPhon sale sliding, Appl needssomeway to convinc current iPhon owner to upgrade. New featur don't alway do that, but an all-""new"" look might.Everyon els is do aluminum now, so the latest iPhon don't visual stand out from the pack.Plast still look low-rent, so that leav glass if Appl want to chang the look of the iPhon while keep it flagship visual appeal.Th first point in particular is a big one as Appl tri to kickstart iPhon upgrad cycles.7 Compani That Will Rule AITh problem with iter design chang - the iPhon 6 to 6s and like the iPhon 7 as well - is that it' not easi to tell that someon is carri the latest new iPhon at a glance. Appl count on some of it custom as be the type who like to be seen with the latest and greatest devices, but thi demograph hasn't necessarili felt the need to upgrad in sever years.Switch to an all-glass form factor would mean there is no mistak a new iPhon for last year' model, or ani Android smartphon for that matter. Appl would be count on thi visibl chang to drive anoth round of iPhon upgrades.Let not forget that use visual design chang to sell new product ha been an Appl favorit for decades: new color of iMacs, iPods, iPhon and iPad have often been use to tri to spark sales.Of cours go to an all-glass enclosur for a new iPhon bring some risks. It sound like an anticip move to OLE display in 2017 will offset ani weight gains, but the fact remain that glass is more fragil than metal.Expect iPhon case maker to do a boom busi if that new iPhon in 2017 doe turn out to be all-glass.A of thi writing, Brad Moon did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceReview: Galaxi S7 EdgeReview: iPhon SE6 of the Best iPhon 6 CasesTh postAppl Inc.: Whi Would Appl Overhaul the iPhon AGAIN?appear first onInvestorPlace."
Qualcomm Braces for Another Big Hit;4/18/2016;"It wasn't that long ago thatQualcommseem to have it made, have larg beaten rivalIntelto the punch in capit on the huge growth opportun that mobil technolog gave it. Yet more recently, those role have revers themselves, and it' Intel that ha found way to bounc back even as Qualcomm struggles. As investor prepar for Qualcomm' fiscal second-quart financi report on Wednesday, they anticip anoth round of massiv declin on the top and bottom lines, and it' critic for the compani to find a long-term strategi that will help it get out of it downturn. Let' take an earli look at what peopl are expect from Qualcomm thi quarter and what could lie ahead for the compani go forward.Imag source: Qualcomm.What will Qualcomm say?Investor are downbeat about Qualcomm' fiscal second-quart prospects. They'r predict a 23% drop in revenu to $5.34 billion, and the consensu forecast call for earn of $0.96 per share, down almost a third from what it earn in the same quarter last year. The compani ha done a good job in past quarter of outpac the expect that investor have set for it, produc earn beat of between $0.04 and $0.07 per share in each of the past four quarters. Yet even if Qualcomm can post better-than-expect earnings, it is still like to be a big drop compar to last year.makeArticleAd();Moreover, Qualcomm investor have becom more pessimist in just the past few months. Recently, they'v cut their forecast for fiscal second-quart earn project by $0.06 per share, and they'v reduc their full-year earn call for thi year and next by 2% to 3%. Still, the stock ha bounc back somewhat, climb 11% sinc mid-January.Qualcomm' fiscal first-quart result in late Januari show the continu downward trajectori that the company' busi ha seen. Revenu wa down 19%, acceler from the previou quarter' decline, and net incom fell by 24%. Weak in both the semiconductor and licens busi wa unusu for Qualcomm, but compani execut note that as poor as the chipmaker' perform was, it wa better than most had expected. CEO Steve Mollenkopf said that he expect Qualcomm' result to improv in the second half of the fiscal year.What' ahead for Qualcomm?On reason whi thing are look for Qualcomm is that the chipmak ha won some big victori in get it chip into import devices. The chipmaker' Snapdragon 820 processor success made it into the newSamsungGalaxi S7, revers the defeat that Samsung dealt Qualcomm last year in deni a spot for the then-cut edg Snapdragon 810 processor for the Galaxi S6. Moreover, other mobil devic maker will use the new Snapdragon 820 as well, and that should help to get Qualcomm back into it leadership role versu Intel and other player in the space.In addition, Qualcomm ha made some progress in help to support it licens busi as well. New agreement with major mobil devic produc in China, includingLenovoandXiaomi, point to a potenti solut in Qualcomm' long-run problem of defend it intellectu properti in a legal system that doesn't give as much protect as tech giant are use to get elsewher across the globe.Qualcomm doe need to keep an eye on Intel, although the two compani appear to be follow differ strategies. Intel recent hire a former Qualcomm execut who had play a major role in Qualcomm' mobil success, but critic argu that the Intel cultur will make it difficult for someon from outsid the fold to have a mark impact. More importantly, Intel need to figur out whether it want to tri to challeng Qualcomm on the high-end perform side of the market. The low-end discount strategi Intel ha follow hasn't been a big threat to Qualcomm as of yet.In the Qualcomm earn report, watch to see how the compani see itself pull out of it downturn. Soon, year-over-year comparison should look a lot better for the company, and that could be all that investor need in order to feel better about Qualcomm' prospect in the future.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc. Reportedly Signs Huge OLED Deal With Samsung Display;4/18/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Accord to a report from The Korea Herald (viaMacRumors),SamsungDisplay is expect to begin supplyingApplewith 5.5-inch OLE display in 2017. Presumably, these display are intend for a next-gener Plu seri iPhone.makeArticleAd();P the report, thi deal is worth a total of $2.59 billion and is said to be for 100 million 5.5-inch OLE panel per year for at least three years.Let' take a look at the implic of thi deal.If the valu is correct, Appl is get OLE panel on the cheapIf the agreement is for three years' worth of supply, and if Appl is get approxim 100 million panel per year, then thi would impli that it is pay $2.59 billion for a total of 300 million panels.If thi deal valu is correct, then thi would suggest that Appl is onli go to pay an averag of around $8.63 per 5.5-inch OLE display. Given that these panel are go to be critic compon of the premium 2017 iPhon (which should start at $749 and go all the way up to $949 if the current price structur holds), that seem like a veri good per-panel price.Even if we assum that the $2.59 billion figur is on anannualbasis, thi would impli a price-per-panel of around $26. Thi is obvious much greater than about $8.63, but for state-of-the-art panel that are onli head to Apple' highest-end and most expens phones, thi wouldn't be terrible.I thi anoth way Appl plan to differenti small from big?Appl ha shown that it will add addit featur to it higher-end iPhon rel to the lower-end ones. Thi is an extrem sensibl move due simpli to the fact that the larger-screen phone sell for more than the smaller-screen one do, which allow Appl to put more featur in for a given gross profit margin structure.Th report explicitli mention 5.5-inch panel and doesn't mention 4.7-inch or 4-inch displays. Thi may suggest that Appl intend to use the more advanc OLE display on it pricier 5.5-inch model as a way to further differenti it largest iPhon from it smaller brethren.Such a strategi would hardli be unique. For example, China-bas smartphon maker Huawei employ such a strategi with it recent launch P9 and P9 Plu flagships; the smaller and cheaper P9 featur an LCD while the larger P9 Plu pack an OLE panel.I think that thi point of differenti alon could drive a non-trivi number potenti custom to buy the higher-end 5.5-inch model over the smaller 4.7-inch one.100 million seem like a lot, though...Appl ship just over 200 million iPhon per year, and even if the iPhon 7 prove a smash hit and the follow-on seri an even bigger hit, I can't imagin iPhon sale push past roughli 250 million unit on an annual basi anytim soon.It is gener believ that the 4.7-inch iPhon tend to dramat outsel the 5.5-inch iPhones, perhap at a ratio of 2:1 in favor of the smaller model.Even if we assum thatallof the, let' call it 250 million, unit that are sold between Sept. 2017 and Sept. 2018 are the newest iPhon seri (an extrem unlik scenario), thi would suggest Appl would onli need around 83 million 5.5-inch OLE panels.Furthermore, it strike me as odd that Appl would sole-sourc (which is what such quantiti of display order would mean) OLE display from it archriv Samsung. I would expectLG Displayto enter the fray for a late 2017 iPhon and Japan Display to suppli OLE to Appl start in 2018, per the company' public statements.OL on iPhon is sure to happen, but thi report may not be get the detail rightTher is zero doubt in my mind that Appl aim to transit at least a portion of it iPhon lineup to OLE and that it would like to do it sooner rather than later. However, I am skeptic of the detail given in thi report from The Korea Herald, particularli around the quantiti discussed.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

Why Apple Inc. Won't Skip AMOLED Displays;4/18/2016;"Imag source: Apple.Mark Hibben, write for Seek Alpha, recentlycast doubton the rumor thatApplewil eventu transit from use liquid crystal display (LCDs) to use AMOL display for it popular iPhon line of smartphones.makeArticleAd();Hibben first note that current-gener AMOL display suffer from ""burn in"" issu as well as ""respons non-uniformity."" He also argu that the LCD found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro -- which DisplayMate' Raymond Soneira review quit posit in a number of critic area -- is so good that it could ""cancel ani perceiv advantag that AMOL might offer in term of color accuraci and contrast.""I respect disagre and wholeheartedli believ that Appl will eventu transit the iPhon to AMOL displays. Here' why.Th 9.7-inch iPad Pro display is awesome, but...There' no deni that the LCD found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is truli excellent. In fact, asid from surprisingli high black level (which lead to rel low ""true"" contrast ratio rel to the ""infinite"" of a good AMOL panel), the panel deliv win in DisplayMate' test against the display found on the Galaxi S7 that a reason argument could be made for Apple' iPad Pro 9.7-inch LCD beingsuperiorto the one on the Samsung phone.There' no doubt in my mind at thi point that the LCD that will be featur in the iPhon 7/7 Plu will be truli excel and even better than the one found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Appl may veri well be abl to claim smartphon display superior over the rest of the industri come Septemb use LCD (and evid suggest that Appl doe signific proprietari display technolog R&D, so it may be uniqu to Appl for a while).That be said, though the iPhon 7/7 Plu display should be excellent, there is still reason for Appl to move to OLED.Perfect black levels, curv panels, and thinner displaysIt is well known that AMOL display allow for ""perfect"" black levels. Thi is due to the fact that the display do not requir a backlight and each pixel is, as Soneira put it, ""individu directli powered.""In other words, when a pixel is suppos to be black, the pixel is simpli turn off.Beyond that, though, there are other advantages. Soneira point out that OLE can be manufactur on flexibl substrat allow for curv displays, as seen on a hand of Android devic (primarili fromSamsung).Unsurprisingly, Appl isrumoredto be plan to roll out a premium iPhon with a curv AMOL display in 2017.Finally, Appl is pretti bent on make it devic thinner, with Apple' Dan Riccio onc say in an interview that everi tenth of a millimet in Apple' product is ""sacred."" OLE display don't requir backlights, which add addit thick to a device. By elimin the backlight, Appl can be free to make even thinner devic without sacrif batteri capacity.But, wait, there' more to Hibben' argumentA I note earli on in thi column, Hibben right point to some of the issu that current-gener AMOL display face rel to LCDs; AMOL certainli aren't perfect and I suspect that current technic issues, coupl with cost considerations, are whi Appl isn't like to use such display in the iPhon 7/7 Plu gener of phones.However, Appl ha ad mani display expert to it ranks, with a larg number of them beingexpert in OLE display technology. These highli paid expert are certainli work to develop next-gener display technologies, like in conjunct with critic display manufactur (LG Display, Samsung Display, Japan Display, and perhap others).Th advantag of OLE are clear, but so are the current drawbacks. It will be up to these engin to solv these problem to produc unequivoc leadership smartphon display for futur Appl product that deliv on all of the advantag of OLE while solv the current challenges/drawback of the technology.It won't be easy, but given how import display technolog is to Apple' key profit driver and how larg Apple' R&D budget ha gotten, I have everi confid that these issu can and will be solv in due course.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

Is Intel Corporation's Mobile Strategy Falling Apart?;4/17/2016;"Last year,Intelmerg it troubl PC and mobil busi into a singl Client Comput group. Intel veteran Aicha Evan wa task with lead the mobil unit, while Kirk Skaugen continu to lead the PC business. But last November, CEO Brian Krzanich hire Murthi Renduchintala,Qualcomm' mobil chief, as the head of the newli creat Client and Internet of Thing (IoT) Busi and System Architectur Group -- which includ chip for PC and ani devic connect to the Internet.Imag source: Intel.makeArticleAd();That decision, which made Renduchintala Krzanich' second in command, reportedli trigger major intern conflicts. Evan and Skaugen both resign in earli April, leav a power vacuum at the top of Intel' biggest busi division. Evan had onli held the posit for less than a year, but Skaugen had previous been favor to becom Intel' next CEO. That shakeup also mean Intel' mobil business, which ha been bleed billion per year, is be left rudderless unless Renduchintala develop new turnaround strategies.What' next for Intel' mobil business?In the past, Intel tri to gain market share by give smartphon and tablet maker steep discount on it Atom chips, co-market deals, and financi assist in redesign logic boards. Those payments, known as ""contra revenues,"" caus the mobil unit to post oper loss of $3.1 billion in 2013 and $4.2 billion in 2014.Intel stop report mobil loss separ last year, but the compani claim the unit made ""almost $1 billion"" in profit improv in 2015, indic it still like lost around $3.2 billion. After all of those losses, Intel finish last year with a mere 1% share of the smartphon processor market. Intel is tri to gradual phase out contra revenu and improv profit by reduc the product cost of it chips. But over the past year, rumor have flown that Asus, one of Intel' top smartphon processor customers, might start use Qualcomm processor instead.Imag source: Intel.Und Evans, Intel' mobil unit score a few minor victories, includ a design win in Xiaomi' Mi Pad 2 andpotenti modem shipmentsfor the next iPhone. But Intel ha been margin so much by Qualcomm and other ARM license that the onli viabl solut seem to be spend billion of dollar to buy tini sliver of mobil market share.Follow Qualcomm is the wrong playKrzanich seem to think hire Renduchintala, who oversaw much of Qualcomm' domin of the mobil chip market, would help Intel becom more competit in smartphones. Back in 2014, Krzanich also hire Qualcomm' Amir Faintuch to co-manag it Platform Engin Group, which design the SoC for Intel' IoT, wearable, and next-gener client and mobil platforms.Krzanich' effort to hire outsid to disrupt Intel' insular cultur were admirable, but I think poach execut from Qualcomm wasn't the right play. The problem is that Qualcomm ha been lose market share over the past few year to nimbler rival like Taiwan-basedMediaTek, which won over mani OEM with it cheaper chips. As for Faintuch and Renduchintala, both execut oversaw the develop of the malign Snapdragon 810, which experienc overh issu and like influenc key custom likeSamsungto use in-hous silicon instead. Top Qualcomm execut are also use tobig compens packages-- that' probabl whi Intel paid $25 million to bring Renduchintala aboard.Follow MediaTek would be the right playInstead, Intel should have poach some top exec from MediaTek, which ha a strong record of market share gain without bloat compens packages. Or better yet, Intel could simpli buy MediaTek, as analyst have suggest for years, to instantli gain control of nearli 20% of the smartphon processor market. MediaTek is also profitable, although increas R&D spend ha weigh down oper profit in recent quarters.MediaTek current ha a market cap of around $11 billion. Even if Intel pay a hefti premium and buy it for $20 billion, it would still be smarter than lose over $3 billion per year to maintain a 1% market share. By integr MediaTek' oper into it own, Intel could pool togeth R&D resourc to cut costs, manufactur chip at lower price with economi of scale, and final stop subsid undeserv OEMs.Frustr at the topIn a leak intern memo recent obtain byTh Oregonian'sMik Rogoway, Renduchintala declar that after numer project review over the past three months, he notic a clear trend -- "" a lack of product/custom focu in execut that is creat schedul and competit gap in our products.""Rec benchmark certainli reveal a big perform gap between Intel' Atom Z350 and Qualcomm' Snapdragon 820, but it could be far too late for Intel to close that gap and catch up. Therefore, hire Qualcomm' top exec simpli won't save Intel' mobil busi -- it must do someth drastic, like buy MediaTek, or give up on the market altogether.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

1 Critical Apple Catalyst This Analyst Overlooks;4/16/2016;"Source: AppleDespit it four other multi-billion dollar businesses, tech giantApplestil live and die by the iPhone.makeArticleAd();A a devic that evolv in cycles, the ebb and flow of iPhon sale have a disproportion effect of sale and profit growth of the world' largest public company. Thi dynam understand elicit it fair share of studi and discuss among the analyst community.Recently, one well-respect research firm lower it price target for Apple' share cite reason I'll discuss below. More importantly, the analysi also overlook a come catalyst for Appl share -- the iPhon 7.The best kind of bad newsA the headlin read inTh Wall Street Journal, ""Peopl Aren't Upgrad Smartphon as Quickli and That Is Bad for Apple."" The titl refer to a recent note from sell-sid research firm BTIG, whose analysi I typic find sophist and well reasoned. Last week, BTIG lower it 12-month price target forAppl stock, but the seemingli neg headlin fail to tell the entir storyline.What' miss is BTIG also maintain it Buy rate for Appl shares, and it new one-year price target for Appl stock of $130 still sit 19% abov Apple' current stock price of $109.02 as of the close of trade on Monday. Read thi way, the news certainli doesn't seem especi negative, though BTIG doe cite a few import potenti develop that could affect Appl in the come months.Specifically, BTIG cite a potenti lengthen of the iPhon upgrad cycl and the possibl competit threat ofSamsung' new Galaxi S7 flagship handset as risk that could weigh on Apple' financi performance. Pars report from the four main U.S. telecom oper and it own research, BTIG make a strong argument that U.S. smartphon upgrad cycl are inde lengthening, a trend that could advers impact carrier and handset OEM like Appl and Samsung.Al told, BTIG now believ sale of smartphon by the four largest U.S. carrier will declin by 3.7% in 2016 befor return to grow 4% in 2017. Wors yet for Apple, BTIG also note that it convers with variou industri player indic Samsung' Galaxi S7 is also prove surprisingli popular. Combined, BTIG see Apple' sale declin slightli in it current fiscal year. However, it seem to me that thi analysi also overlook one veri import wild card.Source: AppleSw factorBar an unimagin shift in strategy, Appl will revamp the form factor for the iPhon 7 later thi year. Importantly, Apple' fiscal year run one quarter ahead of the regular calendar year, mean the holiday quarter is the first quarter of Apple' fiscal year. Seen thi way, the sale effect of the iPhon 7 should appear in Apple' FY 2017, which BTIG agre will return to growth for the Mac maker.

Apple Just Ordered 100 Million OLED iPhone Displays;4/16/2016;"OLE display from both Samsung (left) and LG Display (right), Imag sources: Samsung Display, LG DisplayFor year now, the technolog rumor mill ha specul as to if and whenApplewould begin a broader migrat of it product away from LCD and toward OLE displays. But if recent report from South Korea are ani indication, the Cupertino-bas tech giant may have just taken it biggest step yet toward that transition.makeArticleAd();Accord to lead South Korean news siteYonhap News, lead OLE producerSamsungDisplay juststruck a dealworth an estim $2.59 billion to suppli roughli 100 million 5.5-inch OLE smartphon display annual to Apple. The durat of the agreement is said to be ""at least three years.""Assum the report is accurate, it mark an enorm expans of Apple' use of OLE technology. Up until now, Appl ha onli employ OLE display in it Appl Watch, while choos to stick with LCD for it remain product lines, includ iPhon and iPad.Surprise!(?)Th deal shouldn't come as a surprise. Almost exactli one year ago, Samsung Display rais my eyebrow byform a 200-person teamwhos report goal wa to focusexclusivelyon Apple' display needs.What' more, thi past November, the CFO of OLE specialistUnivers Display Corporation, Sidney Rosenblatt, remind investor that Appl ha been file OLE patent for ""six or seven years."" And while Rosenblatt note the capac like wouldn't be in the marketplac until at least 2017 to satisfi Apple' demand, he also assert hi belief that it'sonli a matter of time, given Appl management' past comment prais the thinner form factor, greater power efficiency, and superior color and contrast that OLE display enable.Univers Display arguabl stand to benefit most from thi deal. Univers Display alreadi count Samsung Display as it single-largest customer, as Samsung ha long use OLE display as a key technolog differenti for it popular Galaxi smartphon and tablets.A I wrote after Univers Display share fell follow itsweaker-than-expect quarterli reportin February, the compani can primarili blame it recent under perform on Samsung Display' year-end inventori management, as well as it recent shift away from UDC' higher-margin host OLE materi -- which aren't protect under it emitter-centr patent portfolio -- in favor of it own. In turn, thi meant a larger percentag of overal revenu came from UDC' lower-priced, lower-margin emitters.Then again, Univers Display' emitt busi ha long remain it primari growth opportunity. While there may be risk of UDC suffer margin pressur givenevenlarger-volum order from Samsung as it work to support Apple, the sheer size of those order should more than compens for it narrow profitability.Ther may (not) be a loserShar ofLG Display-- which stood as Univers Display' second-largest custom last quarter behind Samsung Display -- fell nearli 6% today on the news, presum base on the assumpt that Samsung' gain came at the expens of it South Korean rival. But here again, thi shouldn't come as a surpris consid report date as far back as last Novemb state Samsung had secur it statu as the exclus provid of OLE iPhon display -- that is, at least, for the initi run.Investor should also know it' not uncommon for Appl to hedg it bet by use multipl display suppliers. LG Display wa initi the exclus supplier of OLE display for the Appl Watch when it wa releas last year -- until Appl diversifi it sourc by ad Samsung as a secondari Appl Watch OLE supplier thi past October.What' more, in January,Focu Taiwanreport Appl wasmul an investmentinAU Optronicsto ""transform"" it into a third-reli sourc of OLE iPhon displays. And a full year earlier, supply-chain sourc state Appl had commiss longtim suppliersFoxconnand Innolux tobuild a $2.6 billion OLE display factorywith a target 2017 time frame for production. While LG Display' suppos snub from the initi run of OLE iPhon may not be ideal for the company, the door remain open for it to play a signific support role in Apple' ongo shift to OLED.Regardless of the specif player for now, I'v said it befor and I'll say it again: Apple' OLE iPhon appear to be more inevit than ever. And the financi reward could be great for investor with the foresight to buy and hold the compani help to make it happen.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Are There Any Silver Linings in BlackBerry's Soft Earnings?;4/12/2016;"If you'r like most tech investors, you probabl haven't thought aboutBlackBerryin a while.Th earli smartphon pioneer fail to keep pace with the like ofApple,Samsung, andAlphabet, which led to spectacular declin in it market share and stock price.makeArticleAd();BBRYdata byYChartsTh compani soldier on with a new strategy, center larg on softwar and services. However, share sank earlier thi month on yet anoth disappoint earn report. Are there ani posit for BlackBerri beyond the headlin figures?Earn mix bagTh lead number don't inspir much confidence. Fiscal 2016 annual sale total $2.2 billion, down approxim 33% from the $3.3 billion the compani report in fiscal 2015. Quarterli revenu contract at a more gradual pace, fall 30% from $660 million in the same quarter last year to $464 million.BlackBerri continu it string of net loss -- $238 million for it fiscal Q4 and $208 million for the full fiscal year. Exclud certain charges, such as cost associ with it restructur program, BlackBerri say it Q4 net loss would have been closer to $18 million. Neither figur read well. But let' delv one level deeper.Seg analysisDig further into recent file offer a littl more nuance. Here' how BlackBerry' revenu broke down among it three report segment over it past four quarters:MetricQ4 2016Q3 2016Q2 2016Q1 2016Total non-GAAP revenue$487$557$491$658Softwar and services$156$162$74$138Servic access fees$141$173$211$250Hardware$190$223$201$263Source: BlackBerri investor relations. Figur in millions.Th key area to focu on is BlackBerry' Softwar and Servic segment, which stand alon in repres the company' futur path toward profitability. Though Softwar and Servic revenu didn't grow rel to the fiscal third quarter, it remain essenti flat amid sharp sale contract in the other two divisions.What' more, the gener trend ha been larg posit over the past four quarters, ever sinc BlackBerri institut it three-seg report structure. For the entir fiscal year, the compani surpass it report intern goal of gener $500 million in Softwar amd Servic revenue.Too tough to callTh challeng in analyz BlackBerri is that it' realli two compani in one. You have the legaci handset busi and servic access fee (SAFs), both of which figur to continu to decline.Source: BlackBerry.Thi quarter again prove that BlackBerry' handset divis is effect done. The compani launch it Priv smartphone, the first BlackBerri devic to run on Alphabet' Android mobil OS, to littl fanfare. Some had wonder whether BlackBerry' design might reattract user who had defect from the platform becaus of it increasingli thin select of apps. However, not even Alphabet' smartphon softwar could help BlackBerry' handset prospects. The compani said shipment of smartphon declin from 700,000 in the third quarter to 600,000 in dure it recent report. For context, Appl sold 74.8 million iPhon in Q4 of calendar 2015, and Samsung sold 85.6 million. Stick a fork in BlackBerry' handset division.Similarly, the SAF divis should continu to fade in the come years. BlackBerri histor charg SAF to access the company' secur services. However, with usag of older BlackBerri oper system declin and the rise of new secur alternatives, such as Apple' iMessag and others, fewer and fewer reason exist for custom to continu to pay SAFs. In it public filings, BlackBerri routin signal thi downward trend as like to continue.W can all agre the futur isn't rosi for either division, which leav Softwar and Servic as the lone potenti bright spot on which BlackBerri can stake it future.And it doe offer plenti of potenti upside. One particular area of interest is BlackBerry' QNX softwar division, which figur to compet quit nice against Appl and Alphabet in the softwar that will power futur autonom vehicles. Yet not even Softwar and Servic is grow like a weed. It' not display the kind of growth that would prove it success is highli likely.Such is the head-scratch scenario at BlackBerry. Down but not out, the compani make it too hard to tell whether it futur is bankable.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Pretti good, but still the least flatter of the iPhon SE review accumul here.7 Deep Valu Stock to Buy SoonOf course, no summari of iPhon review would be complet withoutCNET' opinion, and the techi over there were rabid fans, give the iPhon SE an 8.5 out of 10 rate (or four out of five stars).So, all in all, pretti solid review across the board.Whil most review caution reader that the $399 begin price is a bit mislead - 16GB of storag doesn't go so far nowaday - most also conclud that the speedi littl smartphon wa a nice deal for the money.Given the posit reception, I still think the decis to combin modern-day featur with an old-school form factor should be good for AAPL stock, too.A of thi writing, John Divin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

Analyst: Apple Inc. Watch Shipments to Plunge 25% in 2016;4/12/2016;"Imag credit: Apple.Yet anotherAppleproduct categori is expect to face a year-over-year declin in 2016. Accord to KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors), Appl Watch shipment work out to 10.6 million unit dure 2015 (dure which it wa avail for onli eight months). For all of 2016, shipment are expect to drop to just 7.5 million units.makeArticleAd();Thi predict is larg in-lin with areportfrom DigiTim last month claim that Appl Watch sale have been (relatively) tepid and that the categori is expect to declin year-over-year in 2016.Interestingly, accord to Kuo, Appl plan to launch the second gener Appl Watch in the fall of 2016 rather than at WWDC in June aspredictedbi Drexel Hamilton analyst, Brian White. Perhap Appl would be on track to see better year-over-year comparison if it were to releas the refresh devic sooner?Speak of a refresh devic ...White previous claim that Apple' next gener Appl Watch could be anywher from 20% to 40% thinner than the first gener model. However, Kuo, whose track record in nail product-level features/specif is unmatched, believ that the new Appl Watch will gener bring intern improv rather than a signific chang to the industri design.That, Kuo indicates, is like to chang with the 2017 model, which is expect to bring a rework industri design.Can an intern spec bump be enough?For the 2016 Appl Watch, I am expect a signific improv in perform and intern specifications. Although such ""spec bumps"" alon don't seem to be enough to drive iPhon sale growth (a evidenc by the lacklust sale of the iPhon 6s/6 Plus), market correctly, they could help the Appl Watch.Unlik the iPhone, which ha been ""fast"" for quit some time, the Appl Watch is still in it infanc in term of both featur and performance. Thi mean that applic develop are fairli limit in what they are abl to accomplish with the current Appl Watch, which in turn limit the appeal of the devic to consumers.Onc Appl start endow the Appl Watch with more seriou comput power and, perhaps, improv the connect featur of the devic to reduce/elimin the relianc on the iPhone, sale could return to a growth track.Mayb the Appl Watch 2 will perform better than Kuo, the suppli chain vendors, and perhap even Appl itself expect? Time will tell.Mayb the market research firm should tone down their smartwatch predictionsWhenev a new product categori sprouts, the well-known market research firm (IDC, Gartner, etc.) tend to put out multi-year predict for industri unit growth for said product category. Furthermore, with fairli limit sale data, these firm even go so far as to predict unit growth datap oper system.IDC, for example, predict in a recentreportthat Appl Watch sale would come in at 14 million unit in 2016 and grow at a 22% compound annual growth rate through 2020. There are similar predict for other oper system such as Android, Android Wear, Tizen, RTOS, and Pebbl OS.Given that Appl Watch sale are expect todeclinethi year, and given that the other smartwatch maker aren't even on the radar (Samsungha resort to give away it Galaxi Gear smartwatch with smartphon pre-orders), these hyper-bullish industri predict will like prove far too optimist and that investor should not reli on them in make invest decisions.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

GoPro Inc Stock: GPRO Is a Castle Without a Moat;4/12/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsLately,GoPro Inc(GRPO) sharehold have experienc someth close to an action sport. But over the past month or so, thing have settl down a bit and the compani ha caught a nice wave of buying: GoPro stock is up 21% sinc earli February. However, thi could be just a fake-out.makeArticleAd();Th fact is there are still seriou peril for GoPro stock.First of all, it' import to realiz that the sale have been in free-fall. In thelatest quarter, revenu plung by 31% to $436.6 million, and the loss came to $34.5 million or 25 cent per share. Note: Thi wa for the all-import holiday season!But the problem do not appear to be a one-tim event. For the current quarter, GPRO expect revenu of $160 million to $180 million, well below the analysts' consensu of $298 million.GPRO ha taken sever action to get some level of stability. For example, the compani recent cut cost by reduc 7% reduct of it workforce. It also slash price on it latest devic to clear inventory. Finally, GoProbolst it softwar capabilities, spend $105 million for Stupeflix and Vemori (video edit ha been an Achilles' heel for GRPO).7 Dividend Stock That Have Paid Investor Sinc the 19th CenturyBut none of thi may matter much for GoPro stock as the compani still face fierc headwinds. If anything, the GoPro product categori may be mostli a narrow niche.Question Longev for GoPro StockLet' face it, how mani peopl realli need a camera attach to their surfboard or helmet? And besides, for those who do, is there realli a need for frequent upgrades?Lately, it seem that the answer are not veri encouraging.Besides, even if the market potenti is larger, there could still be bad news for GoPro shareholders. The reason is that, well, the compani may violat one of Warren Buffet' timeless principl - that is, a compani need a moat. Thi is a sustain competit advantag that is incred tough for rival to crack.Accord to Buffett:""When we see a moat that' tenuou in ani way - it' just too risky. We don't know how to evalu that. And, therefore, we leav it alone. We think that all of our busi - or virtual all of our busi - have pretti darn good moats. And we think the manag are widen them.""In the case of GPRO, the moat is get tenuous. For example, the market is awash with offer from major oper likeCanon Inc(ADR)(CAJ),Nikon Corp (ADR)(NINOY),Samsung(SSNLF) andSoni Corp (ADR)(SNE). Then there is buzz that other may enter the market likeAppl Inc.(AAPL) and evenUnd Armour Inc(UA).Given all thi activity, the market is vulner to price pressures. After all, take a look at Activeon, which ha a top-notch GPRO altern that is on sale for amer $91. The product current fetch an impress 4.4 star rate onAmazon.com, Inc.' (AMZN) product page.Meanwhile, there are plenti of fast-charg startup make a play for GoPro, such as Fusar and 360Fly. These compani arepush innovationwith their smart editing, virtual realiti connect and safeti function (for example, if you crash your bike, there will be an emerg call).Bottom Line on GoPro StockIt will take some time to get a sens of whether GPRO can make a turnaround.Keep in mind that the next major launch of the core product - the GoPro Hero 5 - will like not hit the marketuntil October. A few month befor this, there will also like be the releas of the Karma quadcopt drone product.So far, the detail are sketchy. But investor in GoPro stock should be wary. The last major product launch - for the Hero4 Session - wa a disaster. The product simpli had few featur that compel custom to pull out their wallets.Oh, and what about the VR product? Thi may also be problematic.Accord to areportfrom Oppenheim analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, the technolog alreadi appear to be ""obsolete.""No doubt, as seen with other former darl in the devic space - likeNokia Corp (ADR)(NOK) andBlackBerri Ltd(BBRY) - it can be extrem tough to recover.Th competit can get overwhelm and price pressur can wreak havoc on margins. Unfortunately, it look like thi playbook is also becom a stark realiti for GoPro stock as well.Tom Taulli run theInvestorPlac blog IPO Playbook.

The LG G5 Is the Most Revolutionary Smartphone in Years;4/9/2016;"LG' latest flagship smartphone, the G5, went on sale last week. At first glance, it appear to be a traditional, high-end Android flagship. But it' pack a featur it competitor can't offer. Indeed, the G5 may legitim be the most revolutionari new smartphon in years.It' a bit of a gambl on LG' part, but if it succeeds, it should provid a compel altern toSamsung' Galaxi seri andApple' iPhones.LG G5 in pink. Source: LGmakeArticleAd();Th first modular smartphon from a major handset makerSpec wise, the G5 is almost indistinguish from a dozen other expens Android phones. It ha a high-resolution, 5.3-inch screen; a Snapdragon 820 processor; and 4GB of RAM. It ha a fingerprint scanner, which ha becom increasingli ordinari in recent years, a USB Type-C connection, a 2,800 mAh battery, and a bodi made of metal. It' price about the same as Samsung' compet Galaxi S7 -- a comparison which isn't favor for LG. In addit to offer spec as good or better on virtual everi front, Samsung' phone is waterproof and support wireless charging. The G5 offer neither.Wher LG set the G5 apart is with a uniqu featur never befor seen on a phone from a major handset maker. The G5' lower bezel slide off, and can be replac with a varieti of altern couplings. LG refer to these as ""friends,"" and they can be use to add addit functionality. So far, LG ha announc two: the Cam Plu and the Hi-Fi Plu with B&O Play. The former add a dedic shutter button, zoom dial, and hand grip, as well as a larg batteri -- perfect for long photo sessions. The later offer a headphon amp and support for high-fidel audio, leverag the well-respect Bang & Olufsen brand to attract the interest of audiophiles.Th possibl seem endless. New friend could add support for wireless charging, better speakers, and an even bigger camera. Busi user could strap on a hardwar keyboard; gamer could attach a dedic controller. The compani could offer a suit of differ modul that make the phone far more customiz than ani of it competitor -- user could tailor the G5 to their need and their current location.Of course, LG ha yet to announc ani addit modules, or even definit confirm that they are coming. When it come to support it innovations, the company' recent track record is spotti at best. Last year' LG V10 sport a second display in addit to it main panel. It wa an interest idea, both innov and unique, but it appear LG ha alreadi move on, as the G5 doesn't offer it.LG Hi-Fi Plu with B&O Play offer audiophil a more premium listen experience.

Last year, it fell out of the top five altogether.Samsung and Appl have both experienc shipment growth sinc then, but the primari culprit for LG' displac is it rise Chines competition. Xiaomi, and in particular Huawei, have enjoy much stronger growth in recent years, releg LG to a second-r handset-maker.LG' brand ha remain strong in some markets. In the U.S., where Xiaomi and Huawei are almost nonexistent, LG is still the third-largest seller of smartphones. In January, 9.6% of smartphon owner use LG-made handsets, accord tocomScore. Apple' share stood at 43.6%, and Samsung' at 28.5%. When LG' 2015 flagship, the G4, went on sale last year, Kantar Worldpanel note an uptick in demand as LG captur more first-tim smartphon buyer and doubl it share of the U.S. smartphon market.Still, with it global share slipping, LG ha to be more aggress to drive interest in it phones.

This Tablet Market Trend Could be Fantastic for Microsoft;4/9/2016;"Window 10 logo. Source: MicrosoftTh tablet market just isn't what it use to be. Tablet shipment fell in the fourth quarter last year, slip 13.7% on an annual basis, while for all of 2015 tablet shipment declin 10.1%. But not all tablet experienc disappoint sales. In fact, demand for one particular type of tablet rose even as other tablet struggled.Accord to research firm IDC, the demand for detach tablet more than doubl in the fourth quarter last year. These tablets, which notabl includeApple' iPad Pro andMicrosoft' Surfac Pro, differ from their traditional, simpl slate counterparts, as they'r intend to be use in conjunct with a keyboard.makeArticleAd();IDC believ thi trend will continu in the month and year ahead. The firm project that shipment of these devic will roughli quadrupl over the next four years, and that by 2020, they will repres a sizabl chunk of the broader tablet market. IDC believ thi trend will mostli benefit Microsoft, as it Window 10 oper system is uniqu posit to take advantag of the form factor.About 35 million Window 10 tablet in 2020There were 16.6 million detach tablet ship global last year. If IDC' project prove accurate, there will be 63.8 million ship in 2020. About half of them (54.5%) will be power by Microsoft' Windows. A littl under one-quart (22.4%) will be iPad Pros. The remain portion (23.1%) will sport the Android oper system fromAlphabet' Google.Thi is roughli unchang from IDC' 2016 projections, which are like to be consider more accurate. Still, it would mean that Appl lost modest share to Google' Android, while Microsoft remain in control of the market as it expanded. The overal tablet market is expect to contract to 195 million unit in 2016, and then experi onli single-digit gain in the year ahead. Detach tablets, then, could repres more than a quarter of all tablet sale by the end of the decade.Factor that spoil IDC' projectionsNevertheless,a I'v point out in the past, IDC ha a poor track record when it come to project oper system dominance. The compani fail to adequ anticip the rise of Google' Android and Apple' iO in the smartphon market, and place far too much faith in Microsoft' abil to adequ respond.Despit openli mock the Surfac for years, Appl now appear to be place increas emphasi on it line of detach iPads. When the compani introduc the 9.7-inch iPad Pro earlier thi month, it explicitli label the devic the ""ultim PC replacement"", and tout it as an altern to the 600 million Window PC in use today that are at least five-year old. Obviously, Appl hasn't disclos it futur plan for the segment, but there' much it could to improv the iPad Pro, and it undoubtedli will in the year to come.Google' emphasi on Android detach ha been virtual nonexistent, with the lone except of it own Pixel C. The Android oper system lack the multitask featur necessari to make such devic truli attractive. Fortunately, they appear to be come later thi year. Android N, the next version of Google' oper system,wil introduc supportfor run two app simultaneously, and it could spark a wave of competit Android detachables.Samsung goe with WindowsBut Microsoft still hold the upper hand in the segment. Window 10, with it support for multipl method of input and automat interfac switching, is specif design for detach tablets, unlik iO and Android, which remain heavili focus on touch input. Last month, Samsunglaunch it answer to the iPad Pro, the Galaxi TabPro S. Previously, Samsung had use Android for all of it Galaxi devic -- but with the TabPro S, it made an exception, opt instead for Microsoft' Window 10.If the market for detach doe acceler in the year ahead, it should help keep the Window oper system relevant. Microsoft isn't as depend on Window as it onc was, but it still make up a larg portion of it business. Last quarter, it More Person Comput segment (which is larg compos of Windows-rel revenue) gener almost half of it revenue.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Waterproof design and the microSD slot were includ in both the Galaxi S4 and Galaxi S5 iterations. That leav the virtual-r bundl as the biggest variable.If Samsung is abl to tripl high-end sale against the backdrop of a smartphon market that is onli expect togrow 7% on a year-on-year basis, it would behoov Apple, Samsung' biggest competitor, to find out how the South Korean electron conglomer accomplish thi growth. If VR is that big of a game changer, Appl should look to add thi function to it next-gen iPhone.It' hard to grow onc you'r AppleTo be fair to Apple, it' slightli disingenu to compar Samsung' first-month total of 9 million to Apple' iPhon sale figures. For a comparison, Appl sold 13 million of the iPhon 6s and iPhon 6s Plu unitsin the first three day of availability.Overall, Appl sold 74.8 million unit in the season heavi first fiscal quarter.Unfortunately, thi huge figur wa flat on a year-on-year basis, and ha fuel concern that Appl is no longer abl to grow it top line at the rapid clip investor have becom accustom to.

Apple's iPhone Beats Samsung in This Key Area;4/7/2016;"Apple' new iPhon SE. Source: Apple.Beware,AppleandSamsunginvestors: Winter is coming. Until recently, both compani have been abl to offset declin in comput and tablet sale with strong smartphon sales. More recently, investor have start to worri about smartphon sale as well. Analyst firmGartnerpredict that smartphon sale will increas onli 7% in 2016, lead Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal to predict that ""the double-digit growth era for the global smartphon market ha come to an end.""makeArticleAd();In two of the three largest smartphon markets, the U.S. and China, growth will be even harder to come by, with Gartner predict flat year-on-year smartphon growth. Thesecond-largest smartphon market, India, is still predict to have strong growth, but peopl in the countri tend to buy lower-cost devic with razor-thin margins.For both compani to overperform, especi in develop markets, Appl and Samsung need to increas their respect market share percentages. Increas the number of user who upgrad to a new model would be a strong step toward grow market share.Apple' upgrad percentag is higher than Samsung'sDur Apple' last confer call, in January, CEO Tim Cook point out that60% of peopl who had an iPhon in Septemb 2014still hadn't upgrad to a newer phone. The time frame in Cook' comment wa important, becaus 2014 is when Appl roll out the larger iPhon 6 and iPhon 6 Plu iteration. Slow upgrad cycl were blame for the iPhone' flat unit and revenu growth last semester. Recently, Appl ha introduc the smaller, cheaper iPhon SE to encourag upgrades.Samsung would love to have Apple' 40% upgrad clip. Areport from Kantar Worldpanelpoint out the differ between the two companies: Samsung' upgrad rate between Februari 2015 and Januari 2016 wa onli 26%.There are a few caveats: Apple' time frame is a littl more than one year and includ two phone iterations, while Samsung' is exactli one year and doe not includ the newest Galaxi S7 and Galaxi S7 Edg unit that were introduc last month. That said, Kantar found onli 9% of Samsung' user were use the then-current-gen Galaxi S6 iteration.Th Galaxi S5 outperform the Galaxi S6Instead, Kantar found a plural of those upgrading, 26.2%, were choos the Galaxi S5. The Galaxi S6 repres a departur from prior versions, with the devic look more like Apple' iPhon line. Samsung' phone reboot lost a few featur Galaxi fan had come to expect, includ waterproof design, a micro-SD slot, and a swappabl battery.Consum Report respond byrat the newer phone lowerthan the prior Galaxi S5 iteration. The newer Galaxi S7 brought back the waterproof featur and the micro-SD slot and increas the S7' batteri capac nearli 20% to make up for the swappable-batteri feature. That may boost upgrad in high-end develop market and increas upgrades.Apple' Cook ha been upfront with hi desir to increas it market share through ""Android switchers."" The iPhon SE is consid a gateway phone by mani analyst to introduc mani mid-rang custom to Apple' ecosystem. If anything, Apple' newest phone should increas it upgrad percentag from those who prefer a smaller phone. Will thi help Appl grow unit shipment over Gartner' 7% figure? While that' not total clear, Apple' new devic further put pressur on a compani that sold more off-gen Galaxi S5 unit than high-end Galaxi S6 units. Samsung ha been aggress to compet with Appl on the extrem high end but may want to put more market money behind a solid mid-rang unit to mitig the iPhon SE' risk.Th stupid-simpl way to score a 22% dividendThere' noth better than cold, hard cash.

FIT Stock: Is Fitbit Inc’s CEO Utterly Out of Touch?;4/5/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(AAPL) ship 11.6 million watch last year, and 4.1 million dure the fourth quarter. While good, sale of the Appl Watch have been somewhat disappointing, especi consid the scale of the company' iPhone.Furthermore, Appl ha been unabl to lead in a market that mani thought it would complet dominate, withFitbit Inc(FIT) still hold a 29.5% market share at the end of Q4 versu a 15% share for Appl after one year in the market.makeArticleAd();Thos who thought the Appl Watch and Android Wear' launch would destroy Fitbit could not be more wrong, with Fitbit' Q4 market share higher than it 26.9% share for the entir year. Thi suggest that Fitbit is gain momentum against it competitors.MVP Portfolio: The 6 Best Stock You Can Buy NowIronically, Fitbit' CEO Jame Park is tell investor how it ha done the imposs - outperform the tech giantsAlphabet Inc(GOOG,GOOGL) and Appl in wearables.Park' belief is that the Appl Watch and other likeSamsung(SSNLF) do too much, and are too complicated. While you might think he' complet out of touch with today' consumer, Fitbit' market share and the rel disappoint perform from Appl and Samsung suggest he' right, which bode well for Fitbit stock.Whi Park Is Right About FitbitTech giant like Appl and Alphabet are tri to make their smartwatch mirror their respect smartphones. These compani want to build out their app ecosystem for wearables, and therebi allow watch to do everyth on a 38mm-to-42mm display that consum do on a 4.7-inch-to-5.5-inch iPhone.Unfortunately, it is not realist that everyon who purchas an Appl Watch want those capabilities, and by cram all those featur into a small wearable, it make the devic complicated. That' essenti what Park is saying.Just to be fair, the big takeaway from thi year' Mobil World Confer is that consum want simplic in their smartwatch, which mean that Park is not alon in hi analysis. Park goe on to say that competitor are not do a good job at promot their best features, or explain to consum ""why"" they need to purchas the product.Fact is if the Appl Watch ha no uniqu featur that set it apart from the iPhone, then whi buy it? Moreover, if the averag consum can't figur out how to get from messag to contact and then back to the averag clock, then Park is right, the devic are too difficult and lack a legitim reason for ownership.FIT Stock Is in a Leagu of It OwnWhat Park ha done is emphas fitness, health and style at an afford price. That is what consum seem to want, with thi approach allow Fitbit to complet domin the wearabl market last year. What' most impress is that FIT did so without ani smart wearables.Just recent FIT launch it first smart wearabl with the Blaze, a devic that wa critic by analyst for be too simpl as a smartwatch. Yet, with a lower price point of $199, a continu emphasi on design, fit and health, along with some new yet seemingli simpl smart featur like on-screen workout that interact with the company' lead iO and Android app.Thes are just a few of the featur that seem too simpl for the like of Appl or Samsung, but are import and actual use to those look to purchas a smartwatch.With that said, we alreadi know that Fitbit is the domin singl player in basic wearables, but the Blaze is well on it way to caus havoc for Appl and Samsung, with one million shipment in it first month. As note in a previousarticle, the higher price point coupl with superior growth in the smart segment versu basic wearabl impli great day ahead for Fitbit stock.You would not know that FIT is so domin by look at Fitbit stock, but it is, and while Park may seem out of touch, the more like scenario is that he know exactli what consum want for their wrist, and that' whi the compani continu toexce all expectations.A a result, it' a good bet to assum that Fitbit' strong perform in the wearabl market will remain if not improv thank to it newli found success in the smart wearabl industry.And that mean FIT stock should follow the company' lead.A of thi write Brian Nichol own share of FIT stock.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Deep Valu Stock to Buy SoonAlphabet: Citigroup Pointlessli Cut GOOGL Stock TargetTh 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2016 Through Q1The postFIT Stock: Is Fitbit Inc' CEO Utterli Out of Touch?appear first onInvestorPlace."
Who's Building the A9 Chips Inside of the Apple Inc. iPhone SE?;4/4/2016;"The TSMC-built Appl A9. Imag credit: Chipworks.Last fall, teardown conclus reveal that the A9 processor insid ofApple' iPhon 6s and iPhon 6s Plu phone were dual sourc fromSamsungandTSMC-- a first for the iDevic maker.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, two tear-down report -- one from Chipwork and one from iFixit - show the use of an applic processor with part number ""APL1022."" Thi part number repres the A9 chip manufactur by TSMC.A question that some might have, then, is the following: ""Are the A9 chip insid of the iPhon SE exclus built by TSMC, or is Samsung in the mix, too?""Answer? It' bothWithout actual tear down the chip themselves, there wa a veri simpl way to identifi -- use the popular perform benchmark, Geekbench 3 -- which version of the A9 chip you got in your iPhon 6s/6 Plus.Imag credit: Author.Tak a look at the screen-shot that I took with my iPhon 6s. You'll notic that the name of the motherboard in thi case is ""N71mAP."" Thi particular string refer to the TSMC-built A9, while iPhon 6s phone with motherboard that are identifi as simpli ""N71AP"" have Samsung-built A9 chips.To tri to figur out if the iPhon SE use applic processor sourc from both chipmak (someth that is veri like to be the case), I look at the differ iPhon SE model that have been pop up in the database.Sur enough, it turn out that there are two distinct motherboard for the iPhon SE as well. One identifi as ""N69AP"" while the other show up as ""N69uAP."" It' not clear at thi time which one refer to the TSMC chip and which to the Samsung chip, but it seem clear to me that both are used.Whi did Appl pick the A9 for the SE?A question that spring to mind is: ""Whi did Appl use the more power A9 for the iPhon SE?""A number of realli good reason come to mind.First, the A8 chip insid of the iPhon 6/6 Plu is built on TSMC' 20-nanomet process. The Taiwan-bas foundri ha been quit clear that it want to reus factori space and equip from 20-nanomet for product of 16-nanomet manufacturing, especi sinc the process are in key way quit similar.Next, Appl is seemingli tri to gain share at the $399-$499 price point and one rel inexpens way to differenti in thi market is to use a class-lead applic processor. Indeed, the older A8 offer a respect amount of performance, but the A9 offer arguabl the best CPU perform avail in a mobil devic today and extrem high graphic performance.Finally, the A9 integr the M9 motion co-processor onto the same die, which like allow Appl to save some space on the logic board. A smaller logic board mean that more room in the alreadi small and slim chassi can be dedic to the battery.Indeed, teardown show that the iPhon SE pack a batteri with larger capac than the one in the 5s and nearli as larg as the one in the iPhon 6s.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

That, asid from the fact that thi wa post on April 1, should have been a pretti big tip-off.However, even if one doesn't allow those two fact deter them, the ""quotes"" includ in the ""report"" are veri clearli fabric and are intend to be humorous.Indeed, the crux of the joke is that if Appl were to tri to run it pre-exist iO softwar on an Intel processor, the processor would be unabl to understand ani of the code, render the devic 100% unusable. Thi ""un-usability"" would mean that the devic would be ""un-hackable"" by entiti such as the FBI becaus the devic couldn't do anything.Whi write about this?Normally, it wouldn't be worth thi Fool' time to write about what is veri clearli an April Fools' joke. However, the fact that thi ""story"" wa pick up by a reput site such as Benzinga and is be circul mean that there will probabl be some investor who believ thi ""report"" -- at least for a time.Th problem with ""believing"" thi report is that if Intel were to actual manufactur all of Apple' A-seri chip from here on out, thi would probabl caus someth of a seismic shift in the semiconductor industry.In thi case, Intel would get atonof quite-profit leading-edg foundri work whileTaiwan SemiconductorandSamsungwould be ""loop out"" of Apple' chip manufactur plan go forward, as it were. Given how import Appl is to the foundri landscape, thi would be a big deal.What' actual go on?Intel is not expect to manufactur the applic processor that will go into Apple' next-gener iPhon or iPads. It is gener believ that Taiwan-bas contract manufactur TSMC will build the A10 chip for the next gener iPhon 7-seri processors.

Apple Inc. iPad Pro 9.7-Inch First Impressions;4/2/2016;"Imag source: Apple.A I said in aprevi article, I plan to place an order forApple' latest iPad, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, as soon as they were avail on the iDevic maker' onlin store. Sure enough, I did just that and sever hour ago my iPad Pro arriv in the mail.makeArticleAd();Although I plan to follow thi column up with a more detail review onc I'v spent some more time with the device, there are sever thought that I would like to get out there follow my first sever hour use the device.Without further ado, let' get to it.New display is awesome; True Tone is incredibleOn of the big problem that I'v had with mani iDevic is that they are simpli calibr out of the factori to be ""too blue."" When Apple' new True Tone featur (which adjust the color temperatur of the display to match current ambient light conditions) is disabled, the display is -- as per usual for Apple' iDevic -- too blue.However, when the True Tone featur is enabled, the white balanc of the display look far more accur and pleasing. Additionally, the display appear to have a higher contrast ratio than my older iPad Air 2 and look about on par with the display on my iPhon 6s.Finally, as somebodi who is a fan of the ""AMOL Photo"" display mode on theSamsungGalaxi S7/S7 Edg seri of phone (which enlarg the color gamut to Adob RGB, a much wider color space than sRGB), I enjoy the richer color satur of the iPad Pro 9.7-inch display. Coverag of the wider DCI P3 color gamut in thi new iPad make color realli ""pop"" compar to those on my older iPad or even on my iPhon 6s.Excel soundAnoth one of the big featur of the iPad Pro lineup is the use of a quad speaker setup. Sound on thi new iPad is quit loud and ""full"" compar to that on my older iPad Air 2. When play games, listen to music, and play video clips/TV shows, the new speaker system is a big step up from the one found in the Air 2.Crazi speedTh iPad Air 2 wa alreadi quit fast -- arguabl the fastest non-Window tablet out there asid from Apple' larger iPad Pro. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro pack in a performance-reduc version of the A9X processor insid of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but it' still appreci quicker than the iPad Air 2.Web page load a bit quicker, intens 3D game like Dead Trigger 2 appear to run more smoothly, and scroll also seem smoother (the new content that' be push onto the display seem to render quicker).Thi is an incred quick tablet; I suspect that in term of perform the devic will age quit well (which is good for the consumer, but obvious not-so-great for Appl which like want to find way to shorten iPad upgrad cycles, not lengthen them).I it worth the money? Can it save the iPad business?I don't think veri mani peopl upgrad their iPad everi year or even everi two years; unless you'r just a big fan of have the latest iPads, I would say that stick to a cycl of three to four year seem sensible.For user of the iPad Air 2, there are clear benefit to the new Pro but probabl not enough to justifi the $599-plu price tag for most people. However, for all user of older iPad - say, iPad 2 through 4 -- the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro is probabl a worthwhil upgrade.Th onli fli in the proverbi ointment is that a good portion of older iPad user probabl have newer, larger iPhones. Although a 4.7-inch or 5.5-inch display isn't anywher close to as larg as the 9.7-inch display on the new iPad Pro, the larger phone will be ""good enough"" for most use cases.Although I realli like the new iPad Pro so far, I'm not convinc it'll be enough to put iPad back on a growth track.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

In fact, at it 'Let Us Loop You In' event, Appl said it sold 30 million 4-inch iPhon in 2015.makeArticleAd();To put that in some perspective, China'sXiaomiwa the world' fifth largest smartphon vendor,mov 72 million smartphonesin total in 2015.It' not just the sale number that drove Appl to releas the iPhon SE.

The iPhon SE ha the chunkier iPhon 5 look with it chamfer edges, but add a color-match stainless steel logo on the back and gain the Rose Gold option of the iPhon 6S.The result is a devic that' extrem comfort to hold.

When you includ the space taken up by iOS, there is onli 12GB or so left for all of a user' apps, videos, messages, music and photos.Consid that justthre minut of 4K video will chew up over 1 GB of that storage, anyon plan to actual use the iPhon SE for shoot photo and video (or keep lot of app and other content locally) pretti much need to move up to the 64GB version at $499. And that' not quit the same bargain.Of cours Appl will make a better profit margin on each 64GB model it makes, so that decis is much more posit from an investor perspective. With the addit of Appl Pay and a modern CPU abl to support new version of iOS, Appl and it partner benefit from the releas of the iPhon SE.And for consum look for an afford or small-screen smartphon from Apple, the iPhon SE is a welcom option.

But a recentGoldman Sachsforecast claim that the Oculu Rift ha a BOM of $500. Assum that estim is accurate, the addit of R&D and market expens mean that Facebook would bare break even on each headset sale.That wouldn't be surprising, consid that modern game consol are sold on the same paper-thin margins. An earli IH teardown ofMicrosoft' Xbox One, which launch at $499, reveal that the consol had a combin BOM and manufactur cost of $471.

3 Winners from the Apple Inc. iPhone SE Teardown;3/31/2016;"Apple' iPhon SE. Imag credit: Apple.On March 21,Appleannounc the latest addit to it iPhon lineup -- the iPhon SE. The devic is price as the company' entri level model, with the 16 gigabyt version sell for $399 and the 64 gigabyt model come in at $499.makeArticleAd();Asid from it price, the devic is novel becaus it ha veri high end process perform and retain the display size and industri design of the popular iPhon 5s.Teardown specialist at Chipworksgot aholdof an iPhon SE and mani of the major compon insid have been identified. Here are three of the winners.No. 1: InvenSenseIn a priorarticle, I suggest that sinc the iPhon SE recycl compon from the iPhon 6/6s, it could veri well move to an iPhon 6/6 class motion processor. If Appl were to do this, rather than recycl the one use in the iPhon 5s, then thi would repres a win for InvenSens which wa not includ in the 5s but did win spot in the iPhon 6 and 6s-seri of devices.Th Chipwork tear-down show that thi is exactli what happen with the iPhon SE.Given that iPhon 6s-seri phone have seen weaker-than-expect demand and given that InvenSens appar lost the main motion processor spot in theSamsungGalaxi S7, the motion process specialist could certainli use thi win.No. 2: Cirru LogicCirru Logic ha long provid audio chip into Apple' devices, so it' not surpris that the iPhon SE pack two audio chip from the chipmaker. What' interesting, though, is that Chipwork say that these chip are the same one that are found in the iPhon 6s/6 Plus.It isbelievedthat Cirru saw a boost in dollar content boost in the iPhon 6s/6 Plu (and by implic the iPhon SE) rel to the prior gener iPhon 6/6 Plu (and certainli rel to the iPhon 5s). To the extent that iPhon SE sale take the place of would-have-been iPhon 5s sale as well as cannib iPhon 6/6 Plu sales, Cirru should benefit.No. 3: QualcommIn go from the iPhon 5s to the iPhon 6s, Appl ha appar adopt Qualcomm' MDM9625M modem and accompani WTR1625L RF transceiver. Thi is the same cellular modem and RF transceiv that wa found insid of the iPhon 6/6 Plu gener of smartphones.Though not a terribl huge win for Qualcomm, the wireless chip giant doe get to see some increas content rel to what it had insid of the iPhon 5s. Given that Appl ship at least 30 million iPhon 5s phone in 2015, and given the attract price point and feature-set of the new phone, thi could work out to be a small posit for Qualcomm overall.Th thing that investor should realli watch for, though, is what kind of content increas Qualcomm will see in the next gener iPhon and whether it will ultim have toshar those spotswith a competitor.Interesting, but not game changingAt the end of the day, the iPhon SE should be a nice devic for some of Apple' suppliers, particularli the first two mention in the abov list. However, what is realli go to be import to investor in Appl supplier is what compon the iDevic maker use in the iPhon 7/7 Plu and how that content compar to that in the iPhon 6s/6 Plus.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

Fitbit Inc Stock Prepares for Takeoff After Blaze & Alta Data (FIT);3/31/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhenFitbit Inc(FIT) announc the launch of a smartwatch, the Blaze, some thought it could be successful, but also knew it would be tough to compet against the like ofAppl Inc.(AAPL),Samsung(SSNLF) andAlphabet Inc' (GOOG,GOOGL) Android Wear.Up until thi point, Fitbit ha domin the basic segment of the wearabl market with it fit trackers, but smart wearabl enter the compani into a new space with faster growth and higher-pr merchandise.makeArticleAd();In other words, success in the smart wearabl arena could be a game changer for Fibit stock.And base on what the compani recent told us, FIT stock is about to revers it bad fortunes.10 Stellar Dow Jone Stock to Buy for Q2Accord to FIT, thecompani ha alreadi shippedmor than one million Blaze devic in it first month of retail availability. That make the Blaze No. 1 in both the smartwatch and heart monitor categori on Amazon.com, and also well exce the expect of ani analyst on the street, most of whom expect a rather slow launch due to limit market and advertis from Fitbit.A a result, one might conclud that the strong perform is from word of mouth, and potenti pre-exist Fitbit owner who upgrad to the smart technology. Currently, there are 1,224 review on Amazon, with 83% give it a 4- or 5-star rating.What Doe 1 Million Shipment Mean for FIT Stock?Fitbit stock is current higher by over 10% in respons to thi news. FIT share are still lower by 50% thi year despit expect for 31.5% revenu growth in 2016 and a stock that is trade at just 10x FY2017 EPS.That said, Fitbit' Q1 guidanc at a midpoint of $430 million in revenu impli growth of 27.9%, or nearli $100 million greater than the same period last year.Som analyst and Fitbit short may conclud that the $100 million increas in sale the compani forecast figur strong Blaze and Alta sales, which are two of the company' newest products. However, I argu that the success with Blaze and Alta is complet unexpected, and becom a massiv short- and long-term catalyst for Fitbit stock.On million Blaze sale at $200 equal revenu of $200 million from thi singl product. Keep in mind, that' one month only! Then, Fitbit also disclos that it newli launch Alta also surpass one million shipment at $129 per, therebi creat $129 million in revenue. Combined, that' $329 million, and onc more, that' from one month only!Then, you have to figur Fitbit' exist product line of basic wearables. Nearli 80% of Fitbit' Q4 revenu came from newer product like the Charge, Charg HR and Surge. Therefore, one must conclud that Fitbit figur on most of it revenu be creat from these note product dure the first quarter, especi with low expect and limit avail from the Alta and Blaze dure Q1.When you add it all up, it is easi to see how Q1 revenu could be $100 million greater than analyst current expect. And more importantly, guidanc should well exceed the company' previous outlook. With 21.4 million shipment last year and revenu of $1.86 billion, Fitbit creat a littl more than $85 per devic shipped. However, the Blaze ($199) and the Alta ($129) are far more expens products, and will quickli boost it averag sell price, and it revenue.Fitbit Stock Gain to FollowI explain earlier thi year that if Fitbit couldship just three million Blazeor smart devic annually, it would creat an addit $600 million in annual revenue.At the time, I wa just hope FIT could creat thi addit revenu by 2019. Never did I expect it would like surpass thi mark in 2016. After all, if Fitbit ha alreadi surpass one million Blaze shipments, in just one month, just think of what it will ship thi year.With over 31 million share short, and Fitbit stock alreadi cheap, the scene ha been set for FIT stock to revers and trade significantli higher in the week ahead, and for Fitbit to both beat Q1 expect and rais guidance.True, FIT stock ha trade lower when it should have risen for sever month now, but given these new developments, and it valuation, it is tough to imagin Fitbit stock is go anywher but higher.A of thi writing, Brian Nichol own share of FIT stock.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Cheap Stock to Buy for $10 or LessAmazon.com, Inc.

Can Samsung Pull Off Its Biggest Transition Ever?;3/30/2016;"More recently, Samsung ha been fault for heavili take design cue from Apple. Imag source: Samsung.Silicon Valley' next big export appear to be it start-up-focus culture.Samsung, the South Korean technolog conglomerate, recent held a ""Startup Samsung"" ceremoni to emphas the company' attempt to transit from a heavili hierarch compani to a fast-moving, flat busi model to spur innov and collaboration.makeArticleAd();Y can't blame Samsung for attempt to change. Three year ago, Samsung command such a larg percentag of Android market share thatAlphabet(then Google) actual fear the compani would attempt to leverag it market share to extract further concess from Alphabet' core search and ad-bas businesses.Mor recently, the compani ha endur market share eros amid competit on the high end fromAppleand in the low-end, develop market from a host of manufactur also sport Android' oper system. In the last year alone, Samsung lost 2.2 percentag point of market share, accord to data from research firm IDC. But ask whether thi chang of mind-set will help Samsung is probabl not the correct question to ask.Can Samsung even change?Accord to aReut articleabout the shift in corpor culture, the compani will reduc unnecessari overtim and weekend work and cut down on unnecessari meetings. South Korean cultur is notori for long work hour with the Organ for Econom Cooper and Develop peg averag annual hour work there at 2,057 last year, 15% higher than the Unit States' averag of 1,789.A CNN articlecom on a cultur where employe feel they can never say no to the boss.Thi cultur is not ideal for technology, disruption, or even a safe work environment.New York Timesbest-sel author Malcolm Gladwel fault South Korean authoritarian cultur and blind defer to author for Korean Air'spoor record of plane crashesin the 1990 in hi bookOutliers: The Stori of Success.

The Hidden Problem Reflected in Apple Inc.’s New iPhone and iPad;3/30/2016;"Imag source: AppleIt' hard to question the most valuabl compani in the world' product vision, but I'm go to do just that.makeArticleAd();Perhap the most wide discuss tech event thi month wasApple' March 21 product presentation, at which the tech giant debut a number of product changes, most notabl it new 4-inch iPhon SE and updat iPad Pro.In a technic sense, Apple' latest devic are certainli impressive, and both it new iPhon and iPad will almost assuredli help Appl sell more devices. However, in connect Apple' most recent product launch with it overal product roadmap in recent years, I find myself wonder about someth that, if true, could spell troubl for Appl and it investors: Ha Apple' product develop lost it revolutionari touch?Stil think different?Let' kick-start thi discuss with a question: What wa the last product Appl produc that, in your view, wa an appreci leap forward in it category?Imag source: AppleAppl is a compani whose brand identity, for better or worse, is built upon revolution, not evolution. However, sinc the iPad' launch in 2010, there' a legitim case to be made that no new Appl product ha been meaning differ from it predecessors. Even the Appl Watch -- though I remain quit bullish on it long-term potenti -- is in mani way simpli a wrist-siz iPod Touch. To be sure, each success iPhone, iPad, and Mac upgrad usher in increment improv across software, hardware, and design. To be clear, the overal direct is positive, and consist so. However, they pace seem frustratingli increment for a compani that ha wow the world with such frequency.Moreover, which of Apple' recent major product updat wasn't in part shape by the industry, as oppos to Apple' histor independ approach to product design? The screen size increas for the iPhon 6 wa pretti clearli influenc by the success of larger Android devic fromSamsung,HTC, and others. The larger screen size and addit of a stylu in the iPad Pro last year appear in part motiv byMicrosoft' Surfac Pro. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Appl at it best didn't react to the product machin of competitors, which ha me partial concerned.A more nuanc takeThough one can't simpli compar the past to the present, I find myself continu to contrast Apple' recent product move to the old stori about Steve Jobs' product overhaul when he return to Appl in the 1997. Here' Job talk about the renew simplic and focu that led to Apple' eventu string of product hits.Source: JackIsBack 15 via YouTube.Apple' product portfolio remain far less complic than the convolut jumbl Job describ in the video. However, in recent years, the trend in Appl products' evolut ha been one of broaden it offer within each of it current platforms. Thi isn't necessarili a neg either. In fact, from a financi perspective, Apple' increasingli divers suit of product is simpli good business.Appl open the iPhon section of it March event by provid a critic piec of context. In the past year, the compani sold 30 million of it 4-inch iPhones. What' more, these smaller model play particularli well among first-tim iPhon buyers, particularli in key emerg market like China. Thi could well reflect Apple' long-stand tendenc to discount it older handsets. Last year, with it move to larger-screen flagship models, Apple' cheapest iPhon were also it smallest. Now, with updat hardwar in a smaller devic at a $399 start price, it seem the new iPhon SE could becom a power tool to draw ever-great number of user into Apple' ecosystem.Mor broadly, thi shift speak to the unpreced growth challeng Appl must navigate. More so than at ani time in it past, Appl must notch massiv win to deliv increment growth to it shareholders. Last year, Appl produc roughli $234 billion in sales. To grow it sale just 10% in 2016, Appl will need to drive $23.4 billion in fresh sales. However, just 10 year ago, Appl produc $24 billion intot annual sales.Such is Apple' current scope that maintain even moder growth requir onc unimagin success year-in and year-out. Seen through thi lens, Apple' diversifi it product portfolio to tap into variou pocket of opportun seem an understand tactic.What' more, with potenti revolutionari product like it Project Titan automot initi or it HomeKit smart-hom hub -- an area I feel Appl could be well-posit to domin -- the firm clearli ha it eye train on shape the futur with potenti revolutionari products. Given it longtim penchant for secrecy, Appl doesn't priorit broadcast these efforts.In the end, I'm more interest here in open the convers than in make a strong argument one way or anoth on thi subject. However, as someon who ha follow the goings-on at the compani daili for the more than five years, thi subtle, Cook-era shift ha come into sharper focu in recent years. Would the compani have follow a similar cours under the legendari Jobs? That' anyone' guess. However, though Apple' March product event wa without question more deriv than watershed, it also spoke to the increas complex that come with be one of the world' largest companies.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple Inc.’s 2017 Flagship iPhone Looks to Borrow from Samsung and Xiaomi;3/29/2016;"Apple' iPhon family. Imag credit: Apple.Even though theAppleiPhon 7/7 Plu have yet to be unveiled, KGI Secur analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reportedli releas a research note over the weekend (viaMacRumors) shed some light on what the iDevic maker ha plan for it 2017 flagship iPhone.makeArticleAd();Th flagship phone will reportedli pack a 5.8-inch AMOL display -- a shift away from the liquid crystal display that Appl ha use in all of it iPhon to date. The display is also expect to be curved, which Kuo say will allow the smartphon to fit in a footprint that might be even smaller than that of the current gener 5.5-inch iPhon 6s Plus.But that' not all. In addit to a curv display, Appl is reportedli look to eschew the aluminum case the hallmark of iPhone' look and feel sinc the 2012 releas of the iPhon 5. Instead, Appl is said to be evalu plastic, ceramic, and glass for the back of the phone; Kuo is confid that Appl will ultim go with glass.Aft read a summari of Kuo' note, it' hard to shake off the feel that the iDevic maker ha now assum the role of afollowerrath than a leader -- at least when it come to smartphon industri design and, in some cases, technology.Curv AMOL display? Samsung ha been do it for a whileIn late 2014, Appl arch-rivalSamsungreleas the Galaxi Note 4 Edge, a variant of it Galaxi Note 4 ""phablet"" with one side of the display curv into the body. It wa essenti a gimmick, but Samsung refin it with the Galaxi S6 Edge, with the display curv intobothsid of the phone.Samsung also ran with thi concept with the recent releas Galaxi S7 Edge.If Appl implement thi in a flagship iPhon in (presum late) 2017, it will ""catch up"" to what Samsung ha been field into the marketplac sinc earli 2015.Curv glass? Ceramic? Also been doneTh Galaxi S7 also featur a metal frame with a glass back. Xiaomi, a China-bas smartphon vendor, recent announc a new famili of flagship devic as well -- the Mi5 series. The two lower-ti model featur metal frame and glass back similar to the Galaxi S7, while the top tier Mi5 (known as the Mi5 Pro) actual come with a ceram back.In other words, the big ""materi change"" that Appl is appar look to implement has, onc again, alreadi been done by another, much smaller competitor to the iDevic maker.Appl must lead, not followAppl is obvious the largest and most profit smartphon maker out there. It ha high custom loyalti rate and easili the highest blend averag sell price in the smartphon industry. From a busi perspective, the compani is still solidli in the lead.However, dure the iPhon 6s/6 Plu cycle, a number of ""cracks"" in the armor have realli begun to show in the company' competit positioning.

One of the reason for the iPhone' popular ha alway been it camera.

This Is the Year of VR, Right? Maybe Not;3/29/2016;"Estim vary, but by most accounts, 2016 is expect to be the year virtual realiti (VR) goe mainstream.Facebook' Oculu Rift headset is be ship to folk who pre-ord the much anticip device, and HTC' Vive headset will hit the street a week later. Gamers, VR' initi market target, are all chomp at the bit to fulli immers themselv in the latest, greatest virtual game, stoke the VR expect fires.So, what could go wrong?It turn out, while the tech commun is clamor to support VR -- there are twice as mani develop focus on the platform than just a year ago -- consum may not be quit readi to jump onboard. At first glance, the sky-high market estim make sense, but accord to a recent survey of 3,000 U.S. adults, the VR hype is premature.makeArticleAd();Imag source:Oculus.Survey saysDespit the hoopla surround Rift, Vive, andSamsung' Gear VR mobil device, among others, Horizon Media ask 3,000 U.S. adult about VR, and ""fulli two third of consum are unawar of the [VR] technology."" That' a surprisingli larg segment of the popul unfamiliar with virtual reality, given the amount of press it ha received.Th two-third of uniniti U.S. adult could repres a market opportun for VR vendors, but it' also indic of VR gain more media attent than consum interest: at least for now. The lack of VR knowledg among potenti user hasn't prevent industri pundit from project explos growth, however.On estim put the VR market at $30 billion in just four years. Other forecast aren't quit as generous, but they still expect virtual realiti will becom a multibillion-dollar busi by 2018. One thing that' common among the market estim -- and that' born out in the recent survey -- is that VR is at least a few year from realli hit it stride.Mor mountain to climbConsumers' lack of awar is a concern, but the survey' most intrigu result wa how mani are will to shell out the necessari fund to buy VR headsets. Of the men and women asked, a combin 36% said they were interest in purchas a virtual realiti devic -- not exactli inspiring. And that' not the biggest hurdl to full-fledg VR adoption.Of those who were interest in a device, just 25% said they were will to spend more than $250 to immers themselv in a virtual world. That' fine with Samsung sinc it mobil Gear VR is an afford $99 and requir noth more than a newer version Galaxi smartphone. But penny-pinch consum could prove to be the biggest hurdl for Facebook's, HTC's, andSony' new PlayStat VR console, which is expect to hit store shelv later thi year.Th money problem is twofold. First, the Rift is list at $599, Vive at a whop $799, and Sony' VR iter will start at $399. Though for consum without a consol camera, anoth $100 is need to enjoy Sony' VR experience. Gear VR is certainli affordable, but it isn't expect to provid the same level of immers as full-fledg devices.Th second challeng Facebook and HTC must overcom is the comput power need to use the VR headsets. Today, less than 1% of the world' 1.43 billion PC have the juic need to util Rift or Vive becaus of the graphic comput power required.Most PC are set up to handl 30 imag frame a second, but VR requir three time that process power. To buy that power, consum would need a $1,500 laptop, or to significantli upgrad exist PCs. Or, with the purchas of a Rift, Oculu can set VR user up with a $1,000 PC thank to it ""special pricing"" bundle. Not exactli a bargain, either way.To no one' surprise, women aren't nearli as interest as men in VR. Gamer are larg male, and that' the initi target market for VR manufacturers. Until VR expand beyond the game community, the Rift of the world will miss out on about half the population.Despit the challenges, virtual realiti will becom a signific market: just not as quickli as some pundit have forecast. For investors, virtual realiti will still help drive revenu for Facebook, Sony, Samsung, and the others, but it appear more patienc will be need than origin thought.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Apple's Reported 2017 iPhone Plans Could Mean Its 2-Year Upgrade Cycle Is Over;3/28/2016;"ByEric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech:KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, who ha been pretti accur over the year (though not perfect) in report on Apple' (NASDAQ:AAPL) futur hardwar plans, state AAPLplan to launchan iPhon sport a 5.8"" OLE display in 2017. He caution the devic could becom a high-end add-on to an iPhon lineup that includ a 5.5"" LCD model if enough OLE panel aren't secured.Appl also is reportedli think of use front-and-back glass panel - save for the plastic 5C, everi iPhon launch sinc the 4/4 ha had an aluminum back panel. Kuo add Appl could also use plastic or ceramic, but think glass is the most like materi choice.Also saidto be part of Apple' 2017 iPhon plans: Wireless charg integr and the inclus of new biometr recognit tech such as face and iri scanning. Applerec bought Emotient, an A.I. startup that develop technolog for deciph human emot via facial expressions.makeArticleAd();Kuo' OLE and wireless charg remark fit to an extent with recent reports. The Nikkei, Kuo, and Korea' Electron Timeshav reportedAppl is interest in launch iPhon sport OLEDs, but some of the report have point to a 2018 (rather than 2017) ETA. Bloomberg, meanwhile,ha reportedAppl is work with U.S. and Asian partner to develop over-the-air wireless charg technolog that could go into iPhon as soon as next year. There' specul (but no confirm yet) that Energ (NASDAQ:WATT) is a wireless charg partner.With OLE product ramp and the technolog steadili improving, migrat from LCD to OLE feel like a smart move. OLEDs, long use by high-end Samsung (SSNLF) phone and gradual take high-end TV share, can deliv better contrast/deep black than LCDs. Moreover, the fact OLE don't need a backlight can potenti yield improv in power consumpt and thick - two thing that Apple' engin have long obsess over.Source: OLED.atOL materi and technolog provid Univers Display (NASDAQ:OLED) is a clear beneficiari if Appl launch an OLE iPhon next year. Depend on whom Appl place OLE order with (and how they compar with it LCD orders), panel manufactur Samsung, LG Display (NYSE:LPL), and AU Optron (NYSE:AUO) could also benefit.A glass rear panel might also be well receiv by consumers. The iPhon 4/4s' glass back (in my subject opinion) help give it a premium feel, and the same hold for Samsung' Galaxi S6 and S7. A tradeoff with use glass instead of aluminum is a greater risk of the phone shatter when dropped, but the iPhon cover glass supplier Corn (NYSE:GLW)ha improvedth Gorilla Glass' shatter resist in recent year and is also work onProject Phire, a solut that promis sapphire-lik scratch resist while maintain Gorilla Glass' shatter resistance. Corning, of course, get to suppli twice as much glass for a phone that ha glass on it back rather than aluminum.(click to enlarge)Th iPhon 4' rear glass panel.Source: Digit Trends.Notably, the hardwar chang reportedli be consid for 2017 iPhon appear much bigger than the one that have beenrumor to datefor thi year' expect iPhon 7 launches. Rel to the 6s/6 Plus, the biggest chang rumor for the 7 are a dual-len rear camera that deliv better imag qualiti and potenti enabl optic zoom, and the remov of the 3.5mm headphon jack (headphon would be connect via Bluetooth or a Lightn port).That, in turn, suggest Appl is will to depart from it standard iPhon hardwar upgrad cycle, through which the compani unveil a major design overhaul everi two years, with smaller upgrad provid in the interim year.If such a strategi shift is occurring, it like ha much to do with the fact that - with it high-end model now sport 4.7"" and 5.5"" display - it' tough for Appl to now have major upgrad cycl revolv around display size increases, as they did for the iPhon 5 and 6. Moreover, with phone subsidi and two-year servic contract (onc the primari mean of buy iPhon in the U.S. and certain other markets) increasingli replac by instal and upgrad plan (includ Apple' ownupgrad program), the incent for link a big iPhon overhaul with two-year contract expir isn't as strong as it use to be.Major technolog improvements, rather than display size changes, are now set to drive Apple' iPhon upgrad pace. And those improv won't necessarili arriv everi other year.Se alsoWynn Vs. MGM: What Compani Will Win Thi New Game Of La Vega Outdoor Attract Poker?on seekingalpha.com"

The sleek design wa a looker, but also difficult to grasp firmly.With the Galaxi S7, Samsung attempt to rectifi those missteps.Th back of the Galaxi S7 gain a bit of curv instead of be perfectli flat, make it much more comfort to hold than the Galaxi S6. The camera bump that first appear in the Galaxi S6 is also much less pronounced.Th Galaxi S7 regain water resistance, with the abil to surviv splash and even a short dunking.Whil Samsung didn't go so far as to offer the replac batteri previou Galaxi smartphon have had (that would be tough to pull off in a waterproof case with tightli bond glass and metal), it did significantli boost the capac of the batteri in the Galaxi S7.Finally, the abil to use a microSD card for cheap storag expans is back (it' hidden in the SIM card tray), but with a caveat - Samsung chose not to support Android Marshmallow' ""adopt storage,"" so the card isn't treat as system storage. However, it work as tradit extra storage, so it can be load up with file like music and movies.Finally, rather than it own Xyno processor, Samsung is return toQualcomm, Inc.(QCOM), use it flagship Snapdragon 820 CPU and tack on an addit gigabyt of RAM.Galaxi S7' New FeaturesTh Galaxi S7 is much more than just a spec bump and a few fixes. There are new features, includ a complet revamp camera system that take on one of the iPhone' key advantages: photos.For years, Samsung ha been push higher megapixel as beingthecrit measur of camera performance. Despit it efforts, the lower-pixel-count iPhon ha consist come out on top as the prefer choic for snap photos.With the Galaxi S7, Samsung gambl and adopt Apple' approach, actual cut the megapixel count compar to last year by switch to larger dual-pixels, while also ad a larger apertur lens.Th result is dramat better photos, with extrem rapid auto-focu and excel low-light results.

3 Possible Winners from the Apple Inc. iPhone SE;3/27/2016;"The iPhon SE in four colors. Imag credit: Apple.Apple' latest iPhone, the iPhon SE, won't make it into customers' hand until March 31, mean that investor probabl won't get to see tear-down report of the devic until sometim after that. However, base on what Appl ha reveal about the device, I think that the invest commun can make some educ guess as to the compani that could benefit should the iPhon SE do well base on the specif of the device.makeArticleAd();Potenti Winner: InvenSenseMot processor vendor InvenSens did not win a spot insid of the 2013 iPhon 5S, but it did secur spot in both the iPhon 6-seri as well as the iPhon 6s-seri of smartphon with it MP67B 6-axi gyroscop and acceleromet solution.Although there is a chanc that Appl ha actual chosen to stick with theST Micromot processor that wa found in the old iPhon 5s , I think the odd are in favor of one from InvenSense. Indeed, Appl is buy the InvenSens part in such high volum to support sale of the iPhon 6-seri and 6s-seri of phone that it could be both simpler and cheaper for Appl to use InvenSens chip for the SE, as well.To the extent that iPhon SE sale take the place of would-b iPhon 5s sales, rather than cannib iPhon 6/6s-seri phone sales, InvenSens could stand to benefit. We'll have to see what the offici tear-down reveal, though.Potenti Winner:BroadcomTh iPhon 5s came with an 802.11n Wi-Fi solut and a categori 3 LTE modem. At the time of launch, these were hardli lead edg solutions, but they were ""good enough"" for the time. The new iPhon SE come with an 802.11ac Wi-Fi radio as well as a slightli faster categori 4 LTE modem.Broadcom should benefit from thi in two ways. Firstly, the 802.11ac radio is almost certainli a higher-valu compon than the 802.11n radio found insid of the iPhon 5s. Broadcom should benefit from the inclus of a higher-valu Wi-Fi solut in Apple' entry-level iPhone.Broadcom also provid RF chip into the iPhon and it is like that the RF content requir to support the faster categori 4 LTE modem is greater than that requir to support the slower categori 3 LTE modem in the iPhon 5s.Potenti Winner(s): Memori MakersTh iPhon 5s came with just 1 gigabyt of now-old LPDDR3 memory. The iPhon SE, on the other hand, pack 2 gigabyt of faster, more efficient, and like more costli to-Appl LPDDR4 memory. Thi would suggest that Apple' memori supplier are pois to benefit from thi increas in memori content.Typ iPhon memori vendor have tradit been SK Hynix,Samsung, andMicron. I suspect that all three will ultim seesomebenefit from the increas in memori content in the iPhon SE vis-à-vi the iPhon 5s (and, to the extent that the SE cannib them, the iPhon 6-series).3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.

Sony Corp. vs. Facebook Inc.: The VR War Is On;3/23/2016;"Electron giantSonywa the hit of last week' Game Develop Confer 2016 in San Francisco after it took the wrap off it much-anticip virtual realiti solution, the PlayStat VR. The VR market is becom crowd with a host of big-tim player vy for what is expect to be a huge market in the come years, so it would be easi to discount Sony' effort when compar toFacebook' soon-to-be-ship Oculu Rift virtual realiti headset, or HTC' Vive.But Soni is take a slightli differ tack with it VR solution. Rather than creat a standalon headset ala the Rift or Vive, the game behemoth intend to focu on it million of exist PlayStat consol owners. Sound like a good plan, given there are alreadi 37 million plu PlayStat 4 unit in gamer' homes. But thank to a partnership between Facebook and Sony' primari game consol competitor,Microsoft, it new VR solut still face an uphil battle.makeArticleAd();Imag courtesi ofOculusLet the game beginSony' soon-to-b releas PlayStat VR ha one featur in it favor where it beat the two other big boy on the VR block: price. The Rift headset, schedul to begin ship later thi month, will cost gamer a hefti $599 (not mention the price of the high-end comput they'll need to connect it to). But even Rift is ""cheap"" compar to HTC' Vive which will set consum back a whop $799.At $499, Sony' ""Launch Bundle"" come with everyth a PlayStat 4 owner will need to exit realiti for a while. For the cost conscious, Soni also offer a ""core bundle"" that includ the VR headset, cabl to plug it into the game console, headphones, and a demo disc for $399. The addit $100 for the complet VR packag toss in a PS camera, motion controllers, and a VR game call ""Worlds.""Soni began take pre-ord for it launch bundl Tuesday, and it' scaled-down VR offer becom avail next week. Unfortun for Sony, though gamer canordera PlayStat VR now, they'll need to wait until Octob befor shipment begin. With Rift just about to hit the virtual streets, and HTC' Vive schedul to begin ship earli next month, those who wait for Sony' entri will face about a six-month lag time.What' at stakeBi most accounts, 2016 will be a so-so year for VR as consum slowli begin climb aboard. Still, market estim suggest there will be sever billion dollar at stake thi year. But 2017 will be an entir differ story, with the VR market expect to surpass $15 billion in revenue, and doubl to about $30 billion by 2020.In the VR war to come, one factor is like to work against Rift and Vive: comput system requirements. Though Oculu and HTC will both be avail long befor Sony' PlayStat VR, both requir a level of comput power most consumers' current machin won't be abl to provide. One studi estim that a mere 13 million PC have the graphic power to support a Rift or a Vive. That' equal to less than 1% of the world' 1.43 billion PCs.Thi comput power deficit is one reason pundit expect that Sony' PlayStat VR and mobil solut like the Oculus-develop Gear fromSamsungwil be the earli VR leaders. That make Rift' deal with Microsoft a possibl game-changer, and could give Facebook an earli advantag over Soni and HTC.It took some folk by surpris when Facebook announc it had ink a deal with Microsoft to includ an Xbox One wireless control with each Rift. But consid the concern about the comput requir of the Rift as a standalon device, both Facebook and Microsoft stand to benefit.Th Xbox One' popular certainli hasn't match that of Sony' PlayStation, but with an estim 18 million unit in consumer' hands, it still repres a big opportun for the Rift to gain an upper hand in what is sure to be a hard fought battl for VR supremacy. At $800, Vive may have price itself out of the run befor the battl even begins.That leav Rift and PlayStat VR as the favorites. Rift' earli introduct and align with Microsoft give it a leg up, but don't discount the power of Sony' exist 37 million PlayStat owners.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Facebook Investors Should Ignore Oculus Rift -- for Now;3/23/2016;"For $600, consum get the Oculu Rift headset, a game controller, remote, and sensor. Imag source: Facebook.2016 is shape up to be the year of virtual reality.It' a market and a technolog that remain in it infancy, but sever compani seem pois to dominate, most notablyFacebook. The social network will launch it first piec of consum hardware, the virtual realiti headset Oculu Rift, on March 28.

Research firm Tractica project that sale of virtual realiti headset will top 200 million within the next four years.makeArticleAd();That may sound excit for potenti Facebook investors, but Oculu isn't like to affect Facebook' busi anytim soon.Not materi in 2016Facebook CFO Dave Wehner address the Oculu Rift on the company' earn call back in January. In short, it won't matter -- at least not thi year."" ... the expect shipment of Oculu Rift ... [the] impact [will] be immateri to our overal total expens for the year ... With Rift, it' realli ... earli in the evolut of VR. It' earli to be talk about larg volum ... it' not go to be materi to our financi thi year.""Facebook' revenu grew 52% last year on an annual basis, and manag expect similarli strong growth in 2016. But that growth will be gener by Facebook' advertis busi -- not it hardware. ""We expect the factor that drove the strong growth of our advertis busi in 2015 will continu in 2016,"" Wehner said.Pric at $600, the Oculu Rift is expensive, and given that it requir an expens PC to function, it total cost of ownership exce $1,000. In time, the technolog will becom more affordable, but not for sever years. The market for the Oculu Rift in 2016 will number -- at most -- just a few million headsets. In a recent interview withDi Welt(via Busi Insider), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledg that it could take at least 10 year to build a vibrant virtual realiti ecosystem.2 other stock that could benefitOth compani should see more dramat effect on their top and bottom line in the near term as the demand for virtual realiti accelerates.NVIDIAandSamsungcould both reward shareholders.NVIDIA provid the power graphic processor need to make PC-base headset like the Oculu Rift function. Last year, there were onli 5.9 million discret graphic card ship worldwide, accord to Jon Peddi Research. That amount to a mere fraction of the larger PC market, which total more than 276 million shipments, accord to IDC. If the Oculu Rift is go to take off, then there' go to be a lot more demand for discret graphic card go forward.NVIDIA deriv the bulk of it revenu from it GPUs, and, more specifically, GPU aim at PC gamer -- the sort of consum most like to purchas the Rift. Last quarter, gaming-rel revenu account for more than 84% of NVIDIA' total revenue. NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang discuss the potenti for virtual realiti at length dure the company' most recent earn call. Given the still high barrier to entry, he offer no hard figures, but said it could provid ""a realli nice bonus"" go forward.Samsung ha partner with Facebook for it own virtual realiti headset,th Gear VR. To be clear, the Gear VR can't provid experi on par with the Oculu Rift (or it other high-end competitors), but it is far more affordable. If you own one of Samsung' flagship smartphones, it will cost you just $100. Other smartphone-mak have unveil compet headset in recent weeks, but Samsung ha steadili built up an ecosystem around the Gear VR, with dozen of exclus game and apps. So long as the cost of high-end, stand-alon headset like the Rift remain high, Samsung can offer consum someth unique. And given that the Gear VR reli on Samsung' smartphon to function, demand for the headset could provid a modest boost to Samsung' smartphon sales.Of course, investor with longer time horizon may prefer Facebook. Oculu Rift is just one devic in a sea of compet products, and it' hard to know how the market will ultim shake out and who will wind up on top. But if you alreadi like Facebook for it grow advertis business, it virtual realiti aspir provid interest upside.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

DSP Group: Undiscovered Semiconductor Gem With 77% Upside Potential;3/22/2016;"ByCobiaman:DSP Group (DSPG) is a littl known innov in the semiconductor industry. The compani domin the market for audio chip that fit into cordless phone with 80% worldwid market share. The cordless busi is the company' cash cow need littl increment invest and throw off lot of cash. Accord to the company' 2015 10-K, the Home business, the vast major of which is the cordless business, did $122 million in revenu in 2015 and gener $25 million in profit.Th company' first growth busi is it mobil segment. In thi segment, the compani sell chip that go into watch and mobil phone where they perform audio function such as ambient nois suppress and voic recognit for voic commands. DSPG' edg is that it chip draw much less power than it competitors, which is veri import to phone and watch maker who want to extend batteri life as long as possible. It ha been a long road for DSPG in thi market as it ha been work on these chip for three year without ani signific market traction.In the past six months, however, the compani ha garner two major design win that will in and of themselv be larg revenu gener but will also give the compani increas credibl with other potenti customers. The first wa with the Samsung (SSNLF) Gear S2 watch. Thi is a lower volum win as the categori is still nascent but provid some revenu and wa a beachhead into Samsung. As ha been reveal by recent teardowns, a DSPG chip is also present in the recent launch Samsung Galaxi S7. The Galaxi S7 come in two versions; one with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and the other with a homegrown Samsung Exyno processor.makeArticleAd();Curr think is that the DSP chip is onli in the Snapdragon version which is be sold in the US and China. If you assum 20% of roughly, 50 million S7 unit are sold with DSP chip at $1 ASP per unit, then you get a $10 million per year revenu stream to DSPG from thi model alone, which is in line with the company' guidance. Thi compar favor with the zero revenu that thi segment did in 2015.The compani is now engag in discuss with other Android phone maker who often follow Samsung' lead when it come to ad compon to their phones. For comparison purposes, there wa a public compani call Audienc that did $160 million in revenu in 2013 from thi type of busi alone. That give you some idea of the upsid that is possibl from thi segment.Th next segment that DSPG oper in is the offic segment. Here the compani sell chip that go into Voice-over-IP busi phones, which is about a $200 million address market. The compani did $20 million in revenu in thi busi in 2015 and ha guid to 50% growth in 2016. There is a favor busi dynam here as the two market share leader in the space, Broadcom and Texa Instruments, are both get out of the busi and DSPG is take advantag through market share gains.Th compani also ha a play on the Internet of Thing in the home. It ha a low-pow commun technolog that it deriv from it cordless busi call Ultra Low Energi ((ULE)) that ha superior characterist versu most compet home technologies. While small last year (about $4 million in revenue), thi is potenti a veri larg market should the compani gain traction here.Finally, the compani recent introduc a new product call the Spark PA, which is a power amplifi design to go into next gener Wi-Fi access points. Thi is a standard CMO part so can be produc less expens than the current gener of SiGe and GaA parts. Besid it cheaper cost, the part also outperform the competition, set it up for traction in the $1 billion market for these devices.Aft a solid first half of 2015, the cordless busi suffer a weaker second half and guid to a veri weak Q1 2016. In addit to fluctuat in end demand, thi market ha also suffer histor from inventori buildup and reduct in the distribut channel. Thi combin ha led to lot of volatil in DSPG' cordless busi over the years. Manag believ that what it is see for Q1 is a combin of weaker end demand plu distributor reduc inventory. Investor have taken the stanc that thi is a worsen of the normal rate of declin in thi busi from 10% to 20%. I think thi neg view is current the base case for the stock and if the busi doe come back, it will be upsid for shareholders.So what is DSPG worth? The compani current ha a market cap of $200 million with $122 million in net cash. The growth busi will have an aggreg revenu of about $50 million in 2015 and be grow at close to 70%. There are no public comp grow that fast but with slower grower valu at 3x sales, I think 4x is a reason multipl for these businesses. For the cordless business, I think 0.5x sale is fair. Finally, you get a free option on Spark PA, as it is tough to valu at it nascent stage. So,$122 million in net cash4 x $50m = $200m for the growth businesses0.5 x $122m = $60m for the cordless business$362m for everyth vs. a $200m market cap today$15.63 stock price target mean 77% upsideSe alsoS&P 500 Valuat Dashboard - Updateon seekingalpha.com"

Refuting an Unfair View of Intel Corp.’s Potential Apple Inc. iPhone Win;3/21/2016;"Intel' XMM 7360. Imag credit: Intel.Regular reader of my column are quit awar of my frustrat withIntel' execut in the world cellular modem and smartphon applic processors. Even as rumor swirl that the chip giant' struggl modem busi is set to reel in a big fish in the form of as much as 40% of the modem spot in the upcomingAppleiPhone, I remain skeptic of such a win for what I believ to be good technic reasons.makeArticleAd();Nevertheless, despit thi frustrat and skepticism, I cannot help but view recent comment around thi potenti win from analyst Chri Dane as, frankly, unfair.Dan think that thi will contribut noth to earn per shareAccord to Danely, thi busi ""would contribut zero [earn per share] due to 0% or wors oper margins.""I just can't see hi reason here.Intel ha alreadi sunk the research and develop dollar associ with brine to life it XMM 7360 (the modem that Appl would use if it were to choos an Intel part) and ha indic that it will continu to invest in a modem roadmap. There is like to be minim additional/speci invest on the modem technolog front associ with a potenti Appl iPhon win.Sinc the vast major of the research and develop spend on Intel' modem ha alreadi been spent and would like have been spent with or without Apple, it doesn't make sens to say thi would not contribut to earn per share.In fact, the onli realist scenario in which I could see thi product have a ""zero"" contribut to earn per share would be if Intel is hand the modem over to Appl virtual at manufactur cost. Given Intel' big focu on tri to improv the profit of it mobil efforts, ""give modem away"" doesn't seem to fit in with the company' current strategy.Icontinu to believethat if Intel win thi deal, I expect it to be accret to gross profit and ultim to net income.Danely' argument around foundri seem strangeIn the same note, Dane appar claim that Intel would be better serv tri to penetr the mobile/wireless market via foundry. On the surface, thi seem reasonable, but in realiti thi is a strategi that is unlik to work.Th major foundri --TSMCandSamsung-- are alreadi ship superior product than what Intel ha manag to build on it own manufactur process for the smartphon and tablet markets.To be quit blunt, Intel doe not have a track record as a third parti foundry. Intel end up outrightbuyingit highest-profil foundri custom which, as we'v recent learned, ha seen signific delay in complet the design of it first Intel-built FPGA.Until investor see a lucrative, high-volum foundri win for Intel, it doesn't seem prudent to assum that Intel could just waltz in and easili win foundri business. Even former Intel foundri Chief Sunit Rikhi indic in an interview with Semiconductor Engin that have compel technolog get the chipmak seat at the discuss tabl but doesn't necessarili mean that it will ""walk away with contracts.""We'l see how thi play outI'm not convinc that Intel ha even won the iPhon 7 and look forward to tear-down to see whether it won the spot or not. However, if Intel ha won, I am confid that it will be posit -- even if just slightli -- for the chip-maker, not neg or neutral.3 compani pois to explod when cabl diesCabl is dying.
