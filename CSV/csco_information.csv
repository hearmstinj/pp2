Why Cisco Is Spending $3.7 Billion on AppDynamics;3/17/2017;"Many were surprised whenCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) announced in late January its decision to buy   AppDynamics. Not the acquisition itself -- Cisco's major   strategy, after all, involves buying tech start-ups and   rebranding them under the Cisco parent name. What was   surprising was the price and timing of the purchase.Cisco announced the deal the evening before AppDynamics was   set to go public. Public investors interested in the company may   have been disappointed, but Cisco did shell out a big number,   buying the company for $3.7 billion in cash and equity options.   This was more than double what the IPO price would have been, as   shares at the top end of the company's range would have priced   the company at $1.7 billion.The $3.7 billion seems steep. AppDynamics only generated $158   million in first the nine months of 2016, for an annual run rate   revenue of roughly $210 million, which means Cisco paid roughly   17 times revenue for the company. While AppDynamics did sport an   impressive growth rate of 54% in the first nine months of 2016,   that's still a hefty price. Moreover, a previous round of   financing for AppDynamics had come in at avaluation of $1.9 billion, so the IPO could have even been considered a ""down round.""makeArticleAd();So, why did Cisco pay up? Let's go through some of the   possible rationales.Image source: Getty Images.What is AppDynamics?AppDynamicsis an enterprise software company that is essentially a   diagnostic tool for large IT departments. Many businesses now   have a complex assortment of applications, databases, on-premise   servers, and cloud infrastructure, plus other networking   components that form the backbone of their businesses. The   interplay between all of these tools can cause bottlenecks, slow   performance, or even crashes. Traditionally, IT professionals   would have to do extensive detective work to find trouble spots   and get everything performing at an optimum level.AppDynamics makes software that will detect what is wrong and   can vastly cut down the amount of troubleshooting IT teams have   to do. It also allows real-time monitoring of all of the elements   in a company's network. That type of insight is very valuable.   For instance, if a company's webpage is not loading correctly,   that can result in lost sales.AppDynamics boasts a laundry list of high-profile companies   that rely on its services, fromCharter Communications(NASDAQ: CHTR) toKraft-Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) . The Motley Fool is also a customer.It appears Cisco didn't want to let this product and   management team slip through its grasp, so out came the   checkbook.AppDynamics has been compared toNew Relic(NYSE: NEWR) and  Solarwinds.New Relic has a market cap around $1.93 billion and the stock   trades around eight times revenue. That being said, New Relic's   year-over-year revenue growth of 43% in the third quarter is   slightly slower than AppDynamics at 54%.Solarwinds used to be a public company, but was bought out by   private equity firms in early 2016 for $4.5 billion. The buyout   represented a 44% premium over the stock's price before news of   the deal surfaced. Solarwinds had a somewhat larger suite of   products, though, beyond merely application management.Don't forget attach ratesWhile some people may scoff at the premium Cisco is paying,   one must always remember the concept of attach rates in these   types of acquisitions. An attach rate is when a large company is   able to cross-sell a secondary product into its existing customer   base, thereby giving the secondary product a much larger market   than it would have had on its own.While AppDynamics has an impressive list of public and private   clients, it is nowhere near the level of penetration that Cisco   has among enterprise, commercial, and service provider   businesses.Taking this into account, investors should assess the attach   rate Cisco can produce for AppDynamics. Surely Cisco is looking   to add software and services capabilities to its suite of   enterprise products. The company is struggling with its legacy   hardware businesses, which are becoming more and more   commoditized. In response, Cisco is attempting to boost its   software and services portfolio via venues including   cybersecurity, performance-enhancing solutions such as   AppDynamics, or 2016's IOTservices acquisition, Jasper   Technologies.Thus, if Cisco can immediately ""attach"" AppDynamics to its   existing product bundle and spread it quickly, it's possible   Cisco can make a good return. Moreover, AppDynamics had been   losing money because of its high sales and marketing efforts, so   perhaps Cisco, in folding the company into its own sales force,   can boost profitability as well as growth. We just don't know yet   how successful Cisco will be in this regard.To be sure, Cisco investors may have been wary about the price   it's paying for AppDynamics. Still, the company does appear to   have a best-in-class offering, and it's possible Cisco can   accelerate the company's growth and margins.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Check Point Software Technologies vs. Palo Alto Networks;3/17/2017;"Image source: Getty ImagesCybersecurity specialistPalo Alto Networks'(NYSE: PANW) stock has taken a massive beating in the wake of   itsdisappointingfiscal second-quarter results. The stock was carrying strong   momentum going into earnings, outperforming rivalCheck Point SoftwareTechnologies'(NASDAQ: CHKP) 17% gains in 2017. Not surprisingly, Palo Alto's   significantly weak outlook for the third quarter threw water over   its rally.makeArticleAd();PANWdata byYCharts.Check Point shares, meanwhile, have remained unaffected after   Palo Alto's debacle, thanks to the company's solidfiscal fourth-quarterearnings. But does this make Check Point a better buy, or is Palo   Alto's drop an opportunity in disguise?A closer look at Palo AltoPalo Alto suffered a major setback when its third-quarter   revenue growth guidance of 17%-20% fell way behind Wall Street's   31.5% expectation, thanks to the execution challenges in its   go-to market strategies. The company has so far relied on   splitting its business into more territories each year, and then   pouring money to accelerate sales.This strategy indicates that Palo Alto is looking to buy its   way into customer accounts as it spends over 54% of its revenue   on sales and marketing. By comparison, the outlay on research and   development was way lower at 21% of sales. This model of spending   aggressively on sales and marketing and keeping R&D costs   down won't work forever in a competitive cybersecurity   landscape.As it turns out, Palo Alto's marketing-focused playbook hasn't   been entirely favorable as the company's sales and marketing   expenses are growing at almost the same rate as its revenue.PANW Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.It is likely that Palo Alto will struggle with a revenue   slowdown in the short run as bigger players such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) are making a stronger push into cybersecurity.   Cisco's security revenue grew 14% year-over-year in the fiscal   second-quarter to $528 million. What's more, Cisco could achieve   over $2 billion in revenue from this business this fiscal year at   its current run rate, which is well ahead of Palo Alto's   projected revenue of $1.73 billion.Additionally, Cisco has stepped up its game in the   cybersecurity space by launching an improved firewall product   family last month. Palo Alto, therefore, might find it difficult   to compete and to continue to grow its product revenue -- which   remained flat in the previous quarter -- and that will impact its   subscription business.What about Check Point?Check Point Software's growth isn'tas fashionableas Palo Alto, but there's one major difference between the two of   them. While the latter has been spending a boatload of money on   sales and marketing to acquire revenue, the Israeli cybersecurity   specialist is more margin-focused.PANW Operating Margin (TTM)data byYCharts.Evidently, Check Point has way better margins compared to Palo   Alto as it spent less than 25% of its revenue on sales and   marketing last quarter. What's more, its margins could get even   better as the subscription model starts gaining momentum.Check Point's subscription sales jumped 26% last quarter,   accounting for around 23% of its revenue compared to less than   20% in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, it entered into $1   million-plus deals with 99 customers last quarter, up from 86 in   the prior-year period. The growing subscription business should   ensure a steady stream of revenue for the future, while more big   ticket deals point toward improving product traction.The better betPalo Alto is a high-growth, high-risk cybersecurity play, so   any weakness in its performance will be met with negative   reactions on the market. Moreover, the company is yet to achieve   profitability (on a GAAP basis) as it has been spending   aggressively to enhance its market share.Analysts expect Palo Alto to become profitable in the next   fiscal year -- forecasting a forward price to earnings ratio of   35 -- though the road is going to be tough. Check Point Software,   meanwhile, is profitable and is better valued than Palo Alto   at 17 times forward earnings.Therefore, investors with a lower risk tolerance would be more   interested in Check Point as it promises stability. Palo Alto's   weakness, meanwhile, looks like an opportunity given the   potential of cybersecurity but it will be prudent to wait and   watch how it manages the revenue slowdown.10 stocks we like better than Palo Alto     NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

6 Things You Didn't Know About Cisco Systems, Inc.;3/16/2017;"Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , one of the biggest networking companies in the   world, is generally known as a slow-growth company which sells   switches, routers, and other networking products. If you had   invested just $3,000 in Cisco's IPO in  1990, your position   would be worth $1.64 million today and be generating nearly   $56,000 in annual dividends.Investors might know that Cisco grew massively in the 1990s   and 2000s, and that its revenue growth peaked in recent years.   However, investors might be less familiar with these seven   lesser-known facts about the networking giant.Image source: Cisco.makeArticleAd();1. Cisco is short for San Francisco""Cisco"" is short for San Francisco, the city where Stanford   computer scientists Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the   company in 1984. That's why in Cisco's early days, Bosack and   Lerner insisted on branding its products with the lowercase   ""cisco"". Cisco's logo, which may initially appear to be just a   series of vertical lines, represents the Golden Gate Bridge, with   the two taller lines signifying the towers.2. Early troubles at StanfordBosack and his wife Lerner founded Cisco when both of them   were still employed at Stanford. Bosack continued working at   Stanford with Cisco co-worker and co-founder Kirk Lougheed, where   they developed the company's first router. However, it was an   exact replica of Stanford's ""Blue Box"" router and ran an   unlicensed copy of the university's multiple-protocol router   software, which was adapted into the foundation of Cisco IOS.In 1986, Bosack and Lougheed were forced to resign from   Stanford over the product's development, and the university   considered filing criminal charges against Cisco over the theft   of its intellectual property. However, Stanford eventually agreed   to license its router software and two computer boards to Cisco   in 1987.3. It was the most valuable company in the     worldCisco's price surged to nearly $80 at the apex of the dot-com   bubble in March 2000, making it the most valuable company in the   world with a market cap of $500 billion. However, that rally   wasn't sustainable, since the stock was trading at nearly240 timesearnings. The bubble popped, and Cisco's subsequent plunge made   it a cautionary tale of the dot-com bust.Cisco stocknever came close to its dot-com bubble levels again. Today, Cisco   has a market cap of just over $170 billion and trades at 18 times   earnings. The most valuable company in the world today isApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which has a market cap of $730 billion and   trades at 17 times earnings.Source:YCharts4. It used to make camerasBack in 2009, Cisco tried to expand its presence in consumer   electronics by  buying Pure Digital Technologies, the maker   of the popular Flip Video camcorders, for $590 million. At the   time, Cisco stated that connecting those cameras to the internet   would allow ""people to share, publish, and [easily] get access to   video,"" which fit its ""vision of visual networking.""That proclamation sounded very similar to the strategyGoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) unveiled five years later. At the time of the   acquisition, Flip cameras accounted for 75% of the handheld   digital camcorder market. But just like GoPro's cameras, Flip   video cameras were gradually rendered obsolete by smartphones --   and Cisco quietly killed the Flip two years later.5. It sold its set-top box business to     TechnicolorIn 2005, Cisco acquired set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta   for $6.9 billion to beef up its video streaming technologies.   Those technologies strengthened Cisco's service provider video   and collaboration products, but the set-top boxes themselves were   a dead weight on its top line growth.That's why Cisco sold  the set-top box business toTechnicolorfor $600 million in late 2015. That's also why Cisco has reported   two sets of top line results over the past few quarters. Last   quarter, its total revenue fell 3% annually, but only fell 2%   after excluding the impact of the set-top box business across all    comparable periods.6. Cybersecurity is its fastest growing     businessCisco's fastest-growing business is its cybersecurity unit,   which grew its revenue by 14% annually to $528 million last   quarter and accounted for 6% of its product revenues. Cisco has   been aggressively expanding that business through big investments   and acquisitions.It also bundles its security products with its networking   hardware and software, which gives it tremendous leverage against   smaller stand-alone security companies likeFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) -- which is frequently cited as apotential takeover targetfor the company.The key takeawaysCisco may be a ""mature"" tech stock which is owned for income   instead of growth today, but investors shouldn't neglect its   colorful history as a Stanford computer science project, the   world's most valuable company, an aspiring connected camera   maker, and a growing cybersecurity company. These facts indicate   that Cisco is much more than a maker of switches and routers, and   investors should keep an eye on its investments in other   markets.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Service Provider Router Revenues Thrive Worldwide in 2016;3/15/2017;"According to a recent report by Dell'Oro, the service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch industry has witnessed a successful 2016 primarily attributed to strong demand from cloud service providers. This happened despite the fact that the traditional telecom operators trimmed network spending at least for the near-term.Routers are telecom infrastructure devices used to deliver data packets from one network to another. These are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect. In 2016, the aggregate market size of service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch was more than $13 billion.Phenomenal demand for 100 Gbps Ethernet ports was the main driving force for this record breaking revenue achievement. China played a major roll as cloud service providers of this country were busy installing backbone and data center interconnect networks. Several industry analysts have estimated that the global router market will reach around $72 -- $73 billion by 2022.Massive growth in the usage of mobile devices has heightened transportation of data traffic substantially. In order to manage this burgeoning demand for photo, video and online data services, telecom operators are required to install more routers to ensure smooth transfer of data packets.In the U.S., majority of demand for service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch are from large cloud service operators like Amazon Web Services of Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, Microsoft Azure of Microsoft Corp.MSFTand Alphabet Inc.GOOGL.

Who Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)?;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith its strong positive catalysts and leverage to high growth technologies,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) could very well follow in the footsteps ofMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) and become a takeover target. Given its powerful growth catalysts and high takeover potential, AMD stock is attractive at current levels, despite its huge advance over the last year.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrOf course,Intel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) acquisition of Mobileyewas seen as an effortby the chip giant to buy a growth engine. Similarly, AMD's highly regarded new chips and processors, combined with its significant presence in the rapidly expanding gaming and graphics markets, make the company a growth engine that could easily attract a suitor such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Cisco Systems, Inc(NASDAQ:CSCO) orInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).AMD's upcoming Zen chips ""are expected to be good,"" reportedPC World, and Forbes columnistAnthony Leathersaid of its Ryzen chips, ""for anyone that does often use rendering, video editing or other programs that benefit from the extra cores and threads, Ryzen is shaping up to be fantastic value.""Most reviewers found that the Ryzen 7 1800K processor slightly outperforms the equivalent Intel processor, but AMD's product sells for half the price of Intel's offering, Leather reported.Moreover, Ryzen processorswill be used for video gaming, as are AMD's Radeon graphics cards.Demand for digital gamesis growing quickly as mobile games become more popular, new consoles are launched, and virtual reality and augmented reality start to take off.7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually SafeSpeaking of VR and AR, ""AMD's Radeon RX 480 (graphics card) can …power virtual reality headsets offered byFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) Oculus and HTC,"" but the cards have a relatively low price tag,VentureBeathas said, as I noted in thisSeeking Alphapiece. So by buying Advanced Micro Devices, an acquirer would obtain access to VR and AR, which are expected to be quite lucrative,PC Worldhas quoted research firm IDCas saying.Specifically, by 2020, 64.8 million VR devices will be shipped, up from an estimated 9.6 million last year, the firm predicted. Some 45.6 million AR hardware products will be shipped in 2020, up from 400,000 in 2016, according to the firm.Finally, Advanced Micro Devices can benefit from the rapid proliferation of the artificial intelligence market.Identifying AMDas one of four stocks that could benefit from the growth of AI, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a January research report that the chip maker could support the technology with field-programmable gate arrays,Investor's Business Dailyreported. Rakesh predicted that the market for servers equipped with AI would jump 12 times ""over the next four years.""Of course, all of these major growth catalysts make Advanced Micro Devices attractive, even without considering a potential acquisition. Although AMD stock has jumped over 400% in the last year, the company's market capitalization is still only $12.9 billion, suggesting that it still has a long runway if it can capitalize on even 50% of its opportunities.Several large companies could look to swallow up Advanced Micro Devices, giving buyers of AMD stock a nice, lucrative call option.As China continues its strong push into semiconductor technology, Beijing could have one of its tech companies buy AMD. Large chip makers from foreign countries other than China, such asTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM) orSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) could easily be enticed by AMD's growth engines.And there's an outside shot that a large, slow-growth U.S. tech company like Microsoft, Cisco or IBM could look to acquire AMD. Although some may say that none of these companies has any experience making chips, Microsoft had no experience in social media but acquiredLinkedIn, Cisco had little experience in IT security before buying companies in that sector, andIBM has made many acquisitionsin so many areas, including, occasionally, hardware. So it wouldn't be that surprising to see Big Blue go after AMD.Beaten-Down Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Still Has ValueAMD has a market cap of $12.9 billion. An acquirer would probably have to pay a premium of at least 30%, meaning that the total price tag would be at least $16.8 billion. All of the companies named above have market caps of $150 billion or more, suggesting that they could all afford to buy AMD.After the Mobileye deal indicated that older, slower tech companies are definitely in the market for growth engines, AMD could easily become the next takeover target in the tech world.As of this writing, Larry Ramer did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonThe postWho Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

178 Million Reasons Why Fitbit Needs an Operations Executive;3/14/2017;"Image Source: Fitbit.comFitbit(NYSE: FIT) took a hit of $178 million last quarter due   to issues with the supply chain, warranty, and soft sales. So   it's not a surprise that Fitbit hired Jeff Devine as an Executive   Vice President (EVP) of Operations reporting directly to the CEO.   With Fitbit's business becoming more complex and sales volumes   reaching almost one fitness tracker per second, small mistakes in   the supply chain can quickly impact the bottom line. This new   position, and Jeff Devine's experience, should help Fitbit   improve its operations engine to match the pace of sales and   aggressive product transitions the company has planned, while   keeping gross margins high.makeArticleAd();Let's look at why Devine was hired, what he brings to the   table and what impact he could have on Fitbit's global   operations.Why now?A picture is worth 1,000 words.Source: Fitbit's Q4-2016 earnings release presentationFitbit's 2016 gross margins took a 9.4% or $178 million hit   related to:Tooling equipment and component scrapIncreased rebates and promotionsIncreased return reserveIncreased warranty reserve for legacy productsAll these items are due to poor operations execution and could   be helped with a focused operations team with a voice in the   executive boardroom.Despite these issues, Fitbit continues to enhance its product   line, making trackers smaller with more capabilities and   therefore more difficult to manufacture.A new smartwatchwith technologies from three separate companies will further add   to the operational challenge. Additionally, James Park, Fitbit's   CEO, wants to streamline the existing product line to make room   for the smartwatch. These upcoming product transitions will be a   challenge to pull off with minimal scrap and no gaps in   supply.Significant improvements to Fitbit's operations are required   or these issues from 2016 will only become worse. James Park   has taken the first step to addressing the problem and hired Jeff   Devine as EVP of Operations.Why Jeff Devine?Jeff Devine has a broad base of high-tech experience that   Fitbit needs to breath new life into the company's ever growing   operations. With a BS in Mechanical Engineering, Devine started   his career in the heart of operations, as a production manager atTexas Instruments. He quickly moved to a leadership position at Boeing overseeing   a high quality electronics manufacturing facility while   completing an MBA at the same time. Devine then moved through   progressively larger and more global roles atNokia,Hewlett-Packard's Palm division,Ciscoand finally Chief Operating Officer at start-up uBeam. It seems   from Devine's resume that he has the ""right stuff"" for the   job.What impact could the right operations executive have?Devine will have responsibility for the functions of   ""operations, customer service, and overall quality"" which should   bring a number of benefits. Because of this functional alignment,   when a problem is brought to customer service, it should be   quickly addressed by the operations team. As Devine owns both   overall quality and customer service this should facilitate   customer service data being used to enhance the customers'   overall experience.This new EVP role will report directly to Fitbit's CEO, giving   operations a voice and a seat at the table at the top levels of   the business. This reporting structure could help bring attention   tomanufacturing issuessuch as the problems with the Flex 2, potentially resolving these   types of issues more quickly. Lastly, Devine should own all of   the end-to-end functions to manufacture and deliver products to   the end customer.

5 Technology Companies That Could IPO in 2017;3/14/2017;"After a tepid 2016, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market has been rejuvenated in 2017, primarily on the back of the recent $24 billion Snap Inc. IPO. Snap's public market debut was the biggest technology IPO since Alibaba's in 2014 and the second-largest U.S. technology based IPO ever, behind onlyFacebookFB, its closest competitor and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.makeArticleAd();Snap's blockbuster IPO clearly demonstrated investors' pent-up demand for technology companies. The loss-making company sold 200 million non-voting shares for $17 per share, above the expected range of $14-$16. Shares were up a massive 44% from its IPO price at the very first day of trading.Snap's hit IPO has opened up flood gates for the next round of public money seekers. This includes the likes of Mule Soft, Alteryx, Carbon Black, AppNexus, Forescout, and Cloudera, all of which are primarily tech unicorns (emerging technology companies that have a valuation of more than $1 billion).However, two high profile technology companies - Uber and Airbnb - are not expected to debut this year as both of them have raised funds in recent times.  Reportedly, Uber raised $3.5 billion from the investment arm of Saudi Arabia in Jun 2016. Airbnb recently closed $1 billion in funding, which puts the company's valuation at $31 billion.Technology IPO Market is HotAlthough Snap's recent price slide is a deterrent to IPO investors, we note that most of the issues are company specific. In fact, we believe that the current macro-economic environment is most conducive for IPO investing based on President Donald Trump's plan of spending $1 trillion on U.S. infrastructure overhauling along with regulatory and tax reforms.We note that lowering of tax rate from 35% to 15% - as proposed by President Trump during his campaign days - will be beneficial to small and mid-cap companies, particularly in the technology sector. This will surely attract IPO investors to this market going ahead.The IPO pipeline remains strong as evident from recent Renaissance Capital data, which showed that 25 IPOs have already been filed this year, up 13.6% compared with the same period last year. Moreover, technology trails only healthcare in filing most IPOs in the last 12 months.Further, ongoing consolidation in the technology market provides a significant opportunity for investors to buy new stocks that have significant growth prospects over the long term.Tech IPOs for the Rest of 2017If a favorable environment prevails, there are a number of privately funded technology companies that can taste the appetite of IPO investors in the rest of 2017. Among them, we would love to see the following five company's debut this year.Headquartered in San Francisco,Cloudflareoffers content distribution network (CDN) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation services.

Cisco Systems Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.39% Yield (CSCO);3/13/2017;"In this series, we look through the most recentDividend Channel''DividendRank''report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO), which saw buying by Director Steven M. West.Back on February 22, West invested $102,678.84 into 3,027 shares of CSCO, for a cost per share of $33.92. In trading on Monday, shares were changing hands as low as $34.00 per share, which is 0.2% above West's purchase price. Cisco Systems Inc shares are currently trading -0.54% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of CSCO shares, versus its 200 day moving average:makeArticleAd();Looking at the chart above, CSCO's low point in its 52 week range is $25.81 per share, with $34.53 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $34.08.

Arrow and Cypress Join Forces to Support Internet of Things;3/13/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Leading electronic parts distributor,Arrow Electronics, Inc.ARW, has teamed up with Cypress Semiconductor Corp.CYto deliver pioneering solutions that will facilitate new, inventive business models for the Internet of Things (IoT).The collaboration will allow Arrow to leverage Cypress' IoT connectivity platform to help its customers in providing analytic platforms, cloud and security technologies. This will bring continuous and complete IoT solutions to market.Cypress is a semiconductor company that offers high-performance, mixed signal and programmable solutions. Its important customers include Lucent Technologies Inc., Seagate TechnologySTX, Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOand Sony Corporation.About IoTThe ""Internet of Things"" is a concept seeking to connect devices used for everyday living to the Internet, so that they can share and exchange data and thereby operate more intelligently. It may also enable devices to communicate with each other wherever required (such as in connected homes).Since it is still in a nascent stage, it is currently dominated by innovative startups. Larger companies like Intel and Alphabet's Google are attempting to provide building blocks. But since the value of the technology might in some cases be a significant percentage of the device cost itself, some of these big companies will become device providers in the IoT world.Despite many companies having come up with their versions of interconnected devices comprising doorbells, thermostats and light bulbs, none has emerged as an industry leader yet.Scope of the IoT MarketThe IoT concept foresees billions of connected devices and systems with applications ranging from sensors and mobile devices to home appliances and cars. According to research firm IDC, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, the IoT market could nearly triple in the coming years. In 2014, the global IoT market was worth $655.8 billion, but it could reach $1.7 trillion by 2020.According to the news source, more than 90% of the world's data has been created over the last two years. We believe that that the chance to tap such an opportunity within the fast-growing IoT market is astounding. In its Jun 2015 report, the McKinsey Global Institute projected that IoT applications could reach as much as $11.1 trillion every year by 2025.  We believe that by adding IoT cloud into its existing solutions, Arrow will gain the most from the continued proliferation of IoT devices.Advantage ArrowThe collaboration will help Arrow becoming a key player in the automotive and industrial IoT segments.Going forward, Arrow will also benefit by gaining wireless technology prowess and bringing more intellect to their products while speeding up time to market.Cypress's WICED software development kit has been designed keeping hardware manufacturers in mind.  The collaboration will help Arrow to enable quick installation of WiFi and Bluetooth in their devices.Per, Aiden Mitchell, global vice president of IoT sales at Arrow, ""Wi-Fi is essential for IoT device connectivity, and Cypress' Wi-Fi and combo solutions will enable us to bring robust cloud connectivity to our customers around the world.""Bottom LineGiven the ever-increasing number of connected products making their way into our everyday lives, IoT is poised to grow strongly. This collaboration brings Arrow some key capabilities to cater to this huge opportunity.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"NVIDIA (NVDA) Unveils Jetson TX2; Strengthens Foothold in AI";3/8/2017;"Graphic chip behemoth,NVIDIA Corp.NVDAcontinues to strengthen its foothold in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. The company introduced NVIDIA Jetson TX2, a smaller open platform to develop more energy-efficient AI computer, making possible a new class of intelligent machines.This new Jetson TX2 is doubly efficient than its predecessors (Jetson TX1 and TK1). At the same time Jetson TX2 uses less than 7.5 watts of power supply and is specially designed for factory robots, commercial drones and smart cameras for AI cities. We believe this will result in smarter devices with higher accuracy and faster response times.The technical specifications of the product are quite impressive. With 32GB eMMC storage, 1GB Ethernet networking and Dual 64-bit NVIDIA Denver 2, Quad ARM A57 CPU, this new Pascal-based GPUs mark the biggest enhancement in the history of embedded computing. Priced at $599, Jetson TX2 is now available in the U.S. and Europe. The company will begin shipping the product on Mar 14.According to Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of the Tegra business at NVIDIA, ""Jetson TX2 brings powerful AI capabilities at the edge, making possible a new class of intelligent machines."" He also added, ""These devices will enable intelligent video analytics that keep our cities smarter and safer, new kinds of robots that optimize manufacturing, and new collaboration that makes long-distance work more efficient.""With the launch of this open platform, NVIDIA can maximize user experience by offering more energy-efficient AI capabilities. Hence, the launch of this product will enable NVIDIA to increase its customer base and help in garnering additional revenues.Consumers are increasingly using cameras to stay in their lane and lower accidents but this is not the primary reason behind the development of this technology. The chipmaker also shared that more companies are already using the TX2 in different ways. One of them is Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOwhich is using this open platform that aids screen sharing, interactive whiteboarding and video conferencing. NVIDIA is trying to revolutionize technology to make devices faster, smarter and more accurate. This, in turn, is expected to benefit NVIDIA going forward.To ConcludeRecently, NVIDIA posted impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results and provided an encouraging first-quarter revenue guidance. Also, the company registered year-over-year growth on both counts, primarily due to growth across all its four platforms. Also, better-than-expected demand for its gaming chips used in personal computers helped the company to post encouraging results.Moreover, we believe that NVIDIA's innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. The higher adoption of NVIDIA's Tegra processors could also act as a catalyst, going forward.Nonetheless, competition from the likes of IntelINTCand QUALCOMM Inc.QCOMremains a near-term headwind.The stock has been clocking solid returns over the past one year and has gained 211.06%, outperforming the Zacks categorizedSemiconductor-Generalindustry's gain of just about 40.50%.Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Verizon to Commercially Deploy 5G Fixed Wireless in 2018;3/8/2017;"The U.S. telecom behemothVerizon Communications Inc.VZis currently conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with partners. The company is looking at mobile hotspot and home-based fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next-generation 5G wireless networks in the U.S. in 2018. However, a full phased 5G wireless network will be offered only in 2020.Currently, Verizon is conducting customer trials in 11 U.S. cities for fixed 5G wireless network. The company is focusing on building a fiber and wireless infrastructure in a bid to deliver mobile video efficiently. Recently, John Stratton, Verizon's EVP and president of operations, revealed this plan at the Deutsche Bank 25th Annual Media & Telecom Conference.The wireless giant, which was the first to deploy the 4G LTE (Long-Term Evolution) network nationwide, is initially testing equipment at 15GHz, 28GHz, 39GHz and 64GHz frequency bands for 5G network deployments. The company's partners in the 5G project are Cisco Systems Inc.CSCO, Ericsson LMERIC, Nokia Corp.NOKand Samsung.Advantage of 5GVerizon claims that its 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps (gigabit per second) which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network. Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds. Further, 5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless networks available these days. Therefore, 5G-enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts.Additionally, superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing the exponential growth of Internet-connected devices, popularly known as Internet of Things (IoT). The U.S. telecom industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Thus, in order to stay ahead of competitors, existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products. At this juncture, we believe Verizon's drive for 5G wireless network bodes well for future growth.Price performance of VerizonIn the last six months, the stock price of Verizon has witnessed a negative growth of 7.80%, in contrast to the Zacks categorizedU.S National Wirelessindustry's positive growth rate of 1.34% in the same time period. Nevertheless, Verizon has a very powerful diversified business model. In the wireless front, it will start initial deployment of the upcoming 5G network in 2018 while on the wireline front, the company is aggressively expanding fiber-based footprint. In the digital media front, Verizon has become a major contender for the lucrative online advertisement business.

Retirees, Maximize Your Income From Dividends;3/8/2017;"Dividend investing is supposed to be a bit like watching grass grow: steady progress, few surprises. But lately, investors holding dividend-paying stocks have suffered some jarring setbacks.SEE ALSO:8 Great Dividend Stocks for RetireesHigher-yielding sectors such as utilities and real estate investment trusts saw valuations soar through much of 2016, then suffered sharp pullbacks later in the year. Analysts see more pain ahead for high-dividend-yielding stocks as interest rates start to rise, diverting income-focused investors from stocks into bonds. A stretch of stagnant earnings growth, meanwhile, put the brakes on the double-digit dividend growth that investors have grown accustomed to since the financial crisis. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dividends climbed just 5% in 2016.""It's realistic to start thinking that the best might be over in terms of dividend growth,"" says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at investment-research firmMorningstar.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Does this mean older investors should scale back dividend holdings? Hardly. The idea of getting income from stocks still ""makes a lot of sense, particularly in this low-rate world,"" says Tony DeSpirito, co-manager ofBlackRock Equity Dividend fund. At roughly 2.5%, the yield on theRussell 1000 Value Indexis about the same as the yield on the 10-year Treasury, he notes. But while the Treasury bond offers a fixed coupon, stocks offer potential dividend growth and share-price appreciation.The challenge is to pick the rightdividend stocksor funds. Rounding up the usual suspects--high dividend-yielding utilities, REITs, consumer staples and telecom stocks--may not be the best approach. One reason: You'd be ignoring some of the biggest dividend-paying sectors, including technology and financials.The higher-yielding stocks also look expensive, even after their late-2016 sell-off, money managers say. Investors have used them as bond substitutes in a low-rate era, and as rates rise, these bond proxies will suffer more than lower dividend-yielders.Stocks that can deliver steady dividend growth, rather than the richest yields, offer the most fertile ground for dividend investors. These holdings look cheaper than the high-yielders, they can hold up well in a rising-rate environment, and they can offer a buffer against market volatility.You can maximize the income you get from these holdings by minimizing fees and taxes. In a dividend-focused mutual fund, a lofty expense ratio can chew through most of your yield. And although the 15% tax rate paid by most investors on qualified dividends seems relatively benign, many holdings favored by dividend investors and dividend funds don't get this treatment. Most REIT payouts, for example, are taxed as ordinary income.Follow these tips to build a dividend portfolio that can deliver reliable income despite rising rates and slowing dividend growth--so you can get back to watching the grass grow.Go for GrowthReliable dividend growers have proved resilient during the roughest times in the market. In a recent study, S&P Dow Jones Indices compared the performance of dividend ""aristocrats""--S&P Composite 1500 stocks that have raised their dividends every year for at least 20 years--against high-yielding stocks in the S&P 500. During the 15 worst months for the broader stock market from the end of 1999 through September 2016, the aristocrats lost 5.9%, on average, versus an 8.6% loss for the high-yielders and an 8.9% average decline for the S&P 1500.Thearistocrats tend to be more resilientduring the worst market downturns in part because raising dividends year after year reflects a certain level of financial health and discipline, S&P notes.So where can you find dependable dividend growers at a decent price? For old-school dividend investors raised on Ma Bell and Coca-Cola, the answers may be a bit surprising.One sector that's highly favored by value-minded dividend fund managers these days: technology. In 2016, the sector surpassed financials to become the biggest contributor to S&P 500 dividends, accounting for 15.5% of payouts.SEE ALSO:25 Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMature tech companies, such as Microsoft (symbolMSFT; recent price, $64), Cisco Systems (CSCO, $32) and Qualcomm (QCOM, $54), generate loads of free cash flow and are finding fewer opportunities to re-invest in their businesses, says Mike Liss, co-manager of theAmerican Century Value fund. That leaves them with an ""ability to increase their dividends at a rate better than the average stock,"" Liss says.Microsoft, which yields 2.3%, has nearly doubled its quarterly dividend in the past five years, to 39 cents a share. Money managers see more healthy dividend growth ahead as the company's leadership in cloud computing improves its earnings-growth prospects.Cisco, which yields 3.3%, is known for making the switches and routers that move data around computer networks. But Cisco is also expanding into faster-growing areas such as collaboration and security. The company has boosted its dividend every year since initiating its payout in 2011.Patient investors should also take a look at Qualcomm, which yields 3.8%, says John Buckingham, chief investment officer atAFAM Capitaland manager of theAl Frank fund. The stock has been crushed this year, in part because Apple is suing Qualcomm over its business practices, and it now trades at just 11 times analysts' estimate of earnings in the coming year. Buckingham believes the litigation will ultimately be settled and ""the magnitude of the decline has created opportunity for those who can take a long-term view.""Look for Healthy PayoutsHealth care stocks have looked rather sickly lately. Concerns about repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as well as talk from Washington about negotiating lower drug prices, have weighed on the sector.But the political noise has created an opportunity for long-term dividend investors, particularly in drug stocks. ""If you continue to create drugs that are innovative and meet unmet needs, you're going to get premium pricing for those products,"" Liss says.Holdings in Liss's fund include drug giants Pfizer (PFE, $32) and Merck (MRK, $64). Pfizer yields 3.8% and trades at just 13 times analysts' estimate of its full-year earnings. While the loss of patent protection on several drugs is a headwind, the company maintains an impressive portfolio of patent-protected drugs and is launching several potential best-sellers in cancer, immunology and other areas.Like Pfizer, Merck has a strong pipeline of new drugs to balance out upcoming patent losses. Cancer drug Keytruda has been a notable success as the company sharpens its focus on unmet medical needs. Merck yields 2.9% and has raised its dividend six years in a row.Swiss drug giants Roche Holding (RHHBY, $30) and Novartis (NVS, $75) also look like good values, says Matt Burdett, associate portfolio manager atThornburg Investment Management. Pricey biologics, which tend to have less generic competition, account for a large portion of Roche's drug sales, and Roche also has a strong diagnostics business. The stock yields 3.4%.Novartis, which yields 3.6%, is well diversified with pharmaceuticals, eye care and other businesses. The company is launching several drugs in key areas such as cancer and heart failure.Guard Against Rising RatesRising rates generally aren't disastrous for dividend stocks. Looking at the two-, three- and five-year periods following the initiation of Federal Reserve rate-hiking cycles dating back to 1954, dividend payers have outperformed non-dividend payers, according to AFAM Capital.But when interest rates rise, some dividend payers do suffer. In recent research, Morningstar looked at rising-rate periods from May 1953 through the end of 2016. The 30% of stocks with the highest yields lost about 1.5%, on average, while the 30% with the lowest yields gained 3.2%.SEE ALSO:8 Dow Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMany dividend-focused fund managers are favoring a sector that stands to benefit from rising rates: financials. As rates rise, banks may see an improvement in their net interest margins--a measure of lending profitability. What's more, banks are likely to see looser capital requirements and other deregulation under the new administration, says Sandy Pomeroy, co-manager of theNeuberger Berman Equity Income fund. With capital freed up, banks may have more flexibility to boost their dividends.Many big bank stocks saw sharp run-ups after the election. One that still looks attractively valued is Bank of America (BAC, $23), says Matt Quinlan, co-manager of theFranklin Income fund. At 1.1%, it doesn't have the richest yield, but it trades for less than book value. The bank has slowly recovered from its ill-advised 2008 acquisition of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial and has sharply cut costs in recent years.Rising rates are also ""a positive for insurance companies who have substantial dollars in fixed income,"" Buckingham says. He likes MetLife (MET, $53), which yields 3% and trades at just 10 times analysts' estimate of its full-year earnings. The company is spinning off a U.S. retail unit, a move that analysts see as helping MetLife generate more stable cash flow.Focus on FundsIf you're shopping for a dividend-focused mutual fund, keep a close eye on fees. A mutual fund's expense ratio eats into its yield. So ""the relationship between expense ratio and income is quite direct,"" Benz says.One high-quality, low-cost fund is Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), an exchange-traded fund that yields 2.1% and charges just 0.09% annually. It tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index, which includes companies that have boosted dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.Another low-cost option: Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). The fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includes companies that not only have paid dividends for 10 years in a row but also have strong cash-flow-to-debt ratios, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. The fund yields 2.9% and charges just 0.07% annually.Investors looking to avoid the highest yielders might also consider iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO). It tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index, which excludes stocks with yields in the top 10% of the broader stock universe. The fund charges 0.08% annually and yields 2.3%.Whether you're choosing a dividend-focused fund or picking your own stocks, pay attention to the potential tax hit. Qualified dividends, which include most U.S. stock dividends, get favorable tax treatment. Taxpayers in the 25% to 35% tax brackets pay 15% on qualified dividends. Taxpayers in the 10% and 15% brackets pay zero; those above the 35% bracket pay 20%. If your adjusted gross income is more than $200,000 for singles or $250,000 for married couples, you'll owe an additional 3.8% on your net investment income, including qualified dividends.But many holdings favored by dividend investors don't pay qualified dividends. Payouts from REITs, some foreign stocks and convertibles can be taxed as ordinary income. With master limited partnerships, a large chunk of distributions is typically tax-deferred, but investors may pay a combination of capital-gains and ordinary-income tax rates when they sell their units.""It's worth looking under the hood"" of dividend-focused funds because many of these funds hold non-qualified dividend payers, Benz says. She points toAmerican Century Equity Income, which is a high-quality fund but tends to hold some non-qualified dividend payers such as convertibles. The fund's 10-year tax-cost ratio is 1.8, according to Morningstar, meaning that investors have lost an average annual 1.8% of assets to taxes. Investors inVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index fund, which holds only common stocks, have sacrificed far less to taxes, losing an average annual 0.73% over the period.Another taxing question for dividend investors is whether to hold foreign dividend-paying stocks--or funds that invest in those stocks--in an IRA. Many countries withhold taxes from dividends that their companies pay to overseas investors. U.S. investors are taxed a second time on those dividends, either when they report dividend income for their taxable accounts or withdraw money from their IRA. You can claim a foreign tax credit on your federal return for the taxes withheld by the foreign country--but only if you hold the stocks in a taxable account. If you hold the investments in an IRA, there's no way to recoup the foreign taxes paid.""If you have an IRA and a taxable account, put the foreign stocks or foreign stock funds into the taxable account,"" says John Burke, a financial adviser atBurke Financial Strategies, in Iselin, N.J. But there's a caveat: Companies in countries that don't have a tax treaty with the U.S. may pay non-qualified dividends, making them a poor fit for a taxable account.

Cisco Is Now an Even Better Dividend Stock;3/7/2017;"While networking hardware giantCisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) fiscal second-quarter report was a bit of a mixed   bag, it contained one great piece of news for investors. Cisco   announced that it was raising its quarterly dividend to $0.29 per   share, up 11.5% from the previous payment of $0.26 per share.   With the stock now yielding 3.4%, an already great dividend stock   has gotten even better.Cisco only began paying a dividend in 2011 after it became   clear that its days as a rapidly growing company were over. The   initial quarterly dividend was just $0.06 per share. Cisco has   raised its dividend at least once a year since then, almost   quintupling it in just six years.Data source: Cisco. Chart by author.makeArticleAd();Among the technology giants, Cisco has one of the highest   dividend yields. A stronger focus on share buybacks over   dividends at many of Cisco's peers is one reason for Cisco's   higher yield. Cisco has spent billions over the past few years   buying back its own shares, but the company's capital return   policy is more balanced than most.CompanyForward Dividend YieldCisco3.40%Microsoft2.43%Apple1.64%Intel2.92%IBM3.10%Data source: Morningstar.Cisco spent $4.75 billion on dividends in fiscal 2016 and   $3.91 billion on share buybacks. Apple sent shareholders $12.15   billion in dividends while plowing $29.72 billion into share   buybacks. Microsoft paid $11.0 billion in dividends and spent   nearly $16 billion on share buybacks. Share buybacks can be a big   win for investors if the price paid is favorable, but I generally   prefer Cisco's dividend-heavy approach.Will the dividend keep growing?Cisco generated $12.4 billion of free cash flow in fiscal   2016, putting the payout ratio based on free cash flow, the new   $0.29-per-share payment and the most recent share count at about   47%. This gives Cisco some room to grow the dividend over the   next few years even if earnings growth doesn't resume. Share   buybacks, which reduce the share count and thus the total   dividend payment, will also help the cause.The company's earnings growth has hit a wall in recent   quarters, creating a situation where the dividend is growing far   faster than earnings. This will eventually become a problem as   the payout ratio grows, and if Cisco can't return to consistent   earnings growth eventually, middling dividend growth will be the   likely result.Its long-term growth plan involves shifting its business more   heavily toward software and services, particularly subscriptions.   Switching and routing hardware will remain the core of the   company, but those businesses have been inconsistent and are   likely unable to drive meaningful growth.Image source: Cisco.Cisco's deferred revenue related to subscription software and   servicesreached $4 billionat the end of the second quarter, up 51% year over year. This is   spread across Cisco's entire business, but faster-growing   segments like collaboration, security, and wireless make up the   majority. The move to subscriptions is hurting Cisco's results in   the near term, as revenue recognition is pushed into the future,   but the subscription business should eventually become big enough   to start driving growth for the company as a whole. At least,   that's the plan.Acquisitions are a big part of Cisco's growth strategy, and   heavy spending on acquiring companies may put a lid on dividend   growth over the next few years. Cisco recently agreed to pay a   whopping$3.7 billion for AppDynamics, a software company that was on pace to generate about $230   million of revenue in 2016. More acquisitions are a near   certainty as Cisco looks to further build out its software   portfolio.One wild card when it comes to dividend growth is the   possibility of corporate tax reform and a tax repatriation   holiday. A lower tax rate and the ability to bring billions of   dollars in overseas cash back to the U.S. inexpensively would   free up a lot of cash for acquisitions, buybacks, and perhaps a   higher dividend. Cisco's balance sheet features around $36   billion of cash net of debt, which could fuel dividend growth   even if earnings growth remains sluggish.With another double-digit dividend increase, Cisco has made   its stock even more enticing to dividend investors. Dividend   growth may slow down going forward, but with a 3.4% yield, Cisco   is one of the best techdividend   stocksaround.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Ciena Corp (CIEN) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?;3/7/2017;"Ciena CorporationCIENis set to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Mar 8. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 38 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.makeArticleAd();However, revenues of $716.2 million topped the consensus mark of $715.9 million. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues grew 40.7% and 3.5%, respectively.Over the trailing four quarters, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 15.92%.Ciena Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCiena Corporation Price and EPS Surprise|Ciena Corporation QuoteHowever, the positive earnings surprise failed to boost the share price in the last one year. While Ciena gained 55.2%, the stock underperformed the ZacksFiber Opticsindustry's gain of 83.8% over the same period.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterRising demand for Packet Optical, Packet Networking and Optical Transport products and increasing use of service management software in the global communication market are positives for Ciena.Expanding Waveserver customer base is also an encouraging factor. During the quarter, the platform was selected by the likes of QTS Realty Trust. We also note that the company's Blue Planet V-WAN platform was selected by Southern Cross Cable Network. Additionally, Ciena's Packetwave platform was also chosen by Quintillion in the quarter.We believe that customer wins will drive Ciena's top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Management expects revenues in the range of $615-$645 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Further, adjusted gross margin is anticipated to be in the mid-40s range, while adjusted operating expenses are likely to be in the range of $220-$225 million, up sequentially.However, rising competition from the likes of Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOand Hewlett PackardHPEcontinues to threaten Ciena's market potential.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ciena is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Cisco Systems;3/6/2017;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the June expiration for CSCO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $32 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 56 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.8% return against the $32 commitment, or a 6.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSCO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems Inc sees its shares decline 6.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $31.44 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 56 cents from $32), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.3% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annualized 6.3% figure actually exceeds the 3.4% annualized dividend paid by Cisco Systems Inc by 2.9%, based on the current share price of $34.15. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 6.3% to reach the $32 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for CSCO below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.4% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the June expiration, for shareholders of Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $35 strike and collecting the premium based on the 76 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 11.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $35 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CSCO shares would have to climb 2.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 4.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Cisco Systems Inc, highlighting in green where the $32 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $35 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cisco Systems Inc (considering the last 251 trading dayCSCO historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $34.15) to be 16%.Top YieldBoost CSCO Calls »"

Server Revenues Continue to Decline Per Gartner and IDC;3/6/2017;"The year 2016 was certainly not a good one for worldwide server vendors. According to recently released data for fourth-quarter 2016 by two independent research firms - Gartner Inc.ITand International Data Corporation (""IDC"") - global server market revenues witnessed a year-over-year decline.Notably, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of decline for the industry. Prior to that, it had witnessed seven straight quarters of year-over-year growth.What the Report SaysAccording to preliminary data released by Gartner, worldwide server revenues decreased 1.9% year over year to $14.838 billion in the fourth quarter while overall shipment inched down 0.6% to 2.939 million. For full-year 2016, server revenues declined 2.7% despite a 0.1% increase in shipments.IDC's views were also more or less similar to Gartner. IDC reported a 4.6% decline in server revenues with fourth-quarter revenues coming in at $14.613 billion. Shipments increased 3.5% to 2.55 million units.The reasons highlighted by the two research firms for this dismal performance were also more or less similar. According to IDC, sluggish investment in hyperscale data center, declining high-end server sales and tough year-over-year comparisons due to the end of the robust enterprise refresh cycle were the main reasons behind the dismal performance.Jeffrey Hewitt, research vice president at Gartner highlighted some distinct aspects of 2016. He revealed that ""Enterprises grew at a lower rate as they continued to leverage server applications through virtualization and in some cases, service providers in the cloud."" However, he added that ""Hyperscale data centers (e.g., Facebook, Google) grew and, at the same time, drove some significant server replacements.""With respect to individual server manufacturers, both the firms have a similar view on the top three vendors. With respect to revenues, according to Gartner and IDC, Hewlett Packard EnterpriseHPEretained its leading position, followed by Dell and International Business MachinesIBM.The research firms had different views when it came to the fourth and fifth positions. As per Gartner, Huawei and Lenovo were at the fourth and fifth position, respectively. On the other hand, according to IDC, the fourth place was a tie between Lenovo and CiscoCSCO. Furthermore, IDC did not mention the vendor's name occupying the fifth position, Instead, for the first time, it provided revenue and shipment data for ODM Direct group of vendors.As per Gartner, it was Dell and Huawei that registered year-over-year growth in revenues as well as shipments. Dell witnessed an increase of 1.8% and 6.5% in revenues and shipments, respectively, while Huawei witnessed 88.4% rise in revenues and 64% growth in shipments.Moreover, according to Gartner, in terms of the number of units shipped, Dell moved to the number one spot with a market share of 19.1%, pushing Hewlett Packard Enterprise to the second spot with 17.2% share.Region-wise, Gartner revealed that except for the Asia-Pacific, every other region witnessed a fall in either revenues or shipment. IDC also agreed to this and said that Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) (APeJ) and Japan were the only regions, which registered year-over-year growth in revenues. Per IDC, server revenues in APeJ and Japan grew 8.1% and 3.3%, respectively.Coming to x86 servers, the two research firms had different opinions. Per Gartner, x86 servers revenues increased 1.1% year over year mainly driven by demand from large-scale data center build-outs and growth in integrated systems.On the other hand, per IDC, revenues of x86 servers declined 1.9% year over year to $12.2 billion while shipments dropped 3.3% to 2.53 million units. Despite a fall of 13% in x86 servers revenues, Hewlett Packard Enterprise retained its leading position while Dell remained at the second spot.Bottom LineAlthough there are differences in the two research firms' figures, they hinted that 2017 will be a tough year as well for server vendors. Gartner predicts modest growth this year, primarily driven by service provider build-outs, which will be partially offset by a decline in unit purchase by enterprises.Kuba Stolarski, research director, Computing Platforms at IDC, has a somewhat similar view. According to him ""Some public cloud datacenter deployments are being delayed and there are indications that overall levels of deployment and refresh may slow down even through the long term as hyperscalers continue to evaluate their hardware provisioning criteria.""He further added ""On the enterprise side, we are seeing ongoing weakness as companies struggle to decide whether to deploy workloads on premises or off, and continue to consolidate existing workloads on fewer servers.""Although there is huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server infrastructure space with more and more companies shifting to cloud-based storage, we believe that the sluggish tech spending environment could continue to hurt the overall server market in the near term.Looking at the two firms' cautious outlook for server shipments, we believe that the overall performance of vendors will remain weak in the next few quarters. Therefore, it is advisable that investors stay away from investing in this space.Currently, International Business Machines and Cisco carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

While the ZacksComputer - Networkingindustry gained 27.6%, shares of this technology giant recorded marginally better returns of 27.7%. This trend can primarily be attributed to improving revenues from subscription services as well as robust demand in the telecom sector.Meanwhile, the company is focusing on expanding its Internet of Things (IoT) division, as per a recent announcement at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona.Based on its acquisition of Jasper Technologies in Mar 2016 Cisco is aiming at becoming a major IoT platform provider going forward.Notably, the platform has emerged as one of the biggest monetization assets for Cisco given the burgeoning demand for IoT.At MWC, Cisco announced that itwill now provide support for narrowband IoT low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), which has applications in the industrial IoT space. Moreover, the company inked a partnership with car-maker Honda and Bright Box, a European connected-car platform which will enable Jasper to breath life into Bright Box's infotainment centers that come as a standard fitting in many of Honda's European car models. It was also announced at the event that Cisco will collaborate with Samsung and Jupl (a health data startup) to develop a wearable device targeted at the elderly for health monitoring purposes.What Does this Mean for Cisco?As of today, on the verge of one year completion, Cisco's IoT unit has witnessed a whopping surge of 157% in enterprise customer additions, 135% increase in the number of devices that are being managed and a 42% advance in adoptions for Jasper's Control Center product.As per an IDC report, the IoT market is estimated to reach a massive $1.7 trillion by 2020 with nearly 30 billion connected ""things."" Given the huge potential the sector has to offer, the time is ripe to carve a niche and that's exactly what Cisco is doing right now.Not surprisingly then, there is stiff competition in the space with the presence of major players such as Alphabet's GoogleGOOGL, MicrosoftMSFT, IBM, Intel, Siemens and AT&T.However, with these announcements, Cisco looks poised to take on the competition head on which augurs well for the company in the long run.Cisco Systems, Inc.

Nutanix (NTNX) Q2 Loss Wider than Expected, View Disappoints;3/3/2017;"Nutanix Inc.NTNXshare price fell 13.8% in after hour trading on Mar 2, after the company reported wider loss in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Moreover, the company's third-quarter guidance failed to impress investors. Apart from facing seasonal impact, its results will be affected by higher memory costs and aggressive investments on product development.makeArticleAd();Loss of 28 cents per share (excluding stock-based compensation) was wider than 26 cents reported in the year-ago quarter despite registering a strong top-line growth. However, the loss figure was much narrower than management's guided range of 35-36 cents. Including stock-based compensation Nutanix reported loss of 65 cents per share.Revenues surged 77.4% from the year-ago quarter to almost $182.2 million, driven by 70.5% and 103.5% growth in product and support & other services revenues to $138.5 million and $43.7 million, respectively.Nutanix Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNutanix Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Nutanix Inc. QuoteNotably, since its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on Sep 30, the share price is down 17.8% as compared with the ZacksIt-Servicesindustry's gain of 10.2%.We expect the stock price to remain under pressure at least in the near term due to headwinds related to North American productivity issues, gross margin impact from increasing costs of NAND and DRAM along with intensifying competition from the likes of NetAppNTAPand Hewlett Packard Enterprise in the hyper-converged market.Quarter DetailsNutanix's enterprise cloud platform ""converges traditional silos of server, virtualization and storage into one integrated solution and can also connect to public cloud services."" The company's offerings include two software products Acropolis and Prism, which are delivered on x86 servers.Billings were up 58.6% year over year to $227.4 million (40% from new customers up from 35% in the previous quarter), reflecting strength in the company's expanding product portfolio. The billings growth was negatively impacted by lesser-than-expected large deals (contract worth $500,000). Nutanix noted that North America productivity suffered due to realignment in the sales force.Meanwhile, international bookings continued to remain strong representing a record 48% of total bookings in the quarter. The bill-to-revenue ratio was 1.25 in line with the normal range of 1.25 to 1.3, which the company expects to continue, going forward.Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV) continued to gain strong adoption, with AHV nodes as a percentage of total nodes improving to 21% compared with 17% in the previous quarter. Management noted that certifications from OracleORCL, SAP and Citrix are helping AHV to penetrate the enterprise market.Based on the Dell partnership, Nutanix continues to add ""Global 2000"" customers. Moreover, the company's software supports Cisco'sCSCOUnified Computing System (UCS) servers, which is helping it to win more of these kinds of customers. Notably, penetration into total ""Global 2000"" surged 68% from the year-ago quarter to 473 at the end of the second quarter.Nutanix added 200 new customers during the quarter bringing total end-customer count to 5,300 at the end of the reported quarter.Operating DetailsGross margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted almost 500 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 58%. This was primarily due to higher memory costs (DRAM and NAND) in the quarter.As percentage of revenues, Sales & Marketing (S&M) expense decreased 350 bps from the year-ago quarter. However, this was fully offset by higher Research & Development (R&D) and General & administrative (G&A) expenses.R&D as percentage of revenues surged to 38.9% as compared with 25.3% from the year-ago quarter. Similarly, G&A expense as percentage of revenues increased 70 bps on a year-over-year basis.As a result, operating loss (including stock-based compensation) widened to $91.4 million as compared with a loss of $35.2 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAt the end of the quarter, Nutanix had cash & cash equivalents of $355 million, up from $347 million in the prior quarter. The company generated $20 million of cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $7 million during the quarter.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $180-$190 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $187.4 million for the quarter.The third quarter is a seasonally slow quarter for Nutanix and management believes that the rebound in North American sales productivity will take some time. Moreover, DRAM prices are expected to increase 30% to 40%, which has forced the company to raise product prices recently. Given the uncertain impact of these increases, management now expects non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 57-58%.Management expects lower gross margin forecast along with higher operating expenses to impact the bottom line. Loss is now anticipated to be in the range of 45-48 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 75 cents per share.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Nutanix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Are Investors Too Excited About Cisco Systems' Anemic Growth?;3/2/2017;"Shares ofCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) recently rose to a 16-year high after it beat   second-quarter estimates on both the top and bottom lines.   Despite that enthusiasm, the headline numbers looked anemic.   Revenue fell 3% annually to $11.58 billion, narrowly beating   expectations by $30 million. Non-GAAP net income stayed flat    year over year at $2.9 billion, or $0.57 per share, which   still beat estimates by a penny.As a Cisco shareholder, I was glad to see the stock climb. But   it also made me wonder -- did Cisco deserve to rise to pre-dot   com bust levels? Or was Cisco's rally merely fueled by demand for   dependable dividend plays with low valuations in a low interest   rate market? Let's take at a closer look at Cisco's earnings   report to find out.Image source: Cisco.makeArticleAd();First, the good news...Cisco's Security business has been its fastest-growing unit   over the past few quarters. Revenue at the business rose 14%   annually to  $528 million, and deferred revenue -- a key   indicator of future demand -- surged 45%. Cisco attributes that   growth to robust demand for its advanced threat solutions   products, next-gen firewall, and secure internet gateway.Cisco's collaboration revenue also rose 4% to $1.06 billion,   and deferred revenue grew 14%. That growth was  attributed   to WebEx and Spark, the cloud-based enterprise collaboration   platform it launched in late 2015. However, Spark currently faces   tough competition in the collaboration space fromrival platforms.Cisco's Spark. Image source: Cisco.Cisco's wireless revenues rose 3% to $632 million, fueled by   the ongoing expansion of wireless infrastructure to satisfy data   hungry customers, strong sales of its 11ac Wave 2 (a new Wi-Fi   standard) portfolio of products, and growing demand for its   Meraki cloud-based services.Cisco's total deferred revenues rose 13% annually to $17.1   billion, thanks to higher demand for subscription-based and   software offerings. That growth will gradually allow Cisco to   pivot away from its slower-growth hardware businesses. Cisco also   hiked its dividend by three cents to $0.29 per share, giving it a   forward yield of 3.4% and marking its sixth consecutive dividend   hike. Lastly, Cisco generated $12.3 billion in free cash flow   over the past 12 months -- which gives it plenty of capital to   buy up additional companies inhigher-growth marketslike security, analytics, and the Internet of Things.Now, the bad news...The big problem for Cisco is that its security, collaboration,   and wireless businesses only generated less than a fifth of its   total revenue. Nearly half of Cisco's revenues still come from   its switches and routers units, which are both experiencing   sluggish growth due to market saturation and commoditization.Cisco's switching revenue fell 5% annually to $3.31 billion   during the quarter, due to weaker demand from campus customers,   which was partly offset by rising demand for its ACI   (application-centric infrastructure) products. Routing revenue   fell 10% to $1.82 billion, as growth in orders failed to offset   pricing pressure.Those declines indicate that cloud-based SDN (software-defined   networking) rivals likeArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) -- which Cisco is trying to tackle with    lawsuits -- are causing a disruptive paradigm shift across   the market. Cloud-based networking solutions are more scalable   and require less on-site hardware like routers and switches,   which could turn Cisco's business upside down. Arista has even   claimed that combining its Jericho switches with its FlexRoute   software can completelyreplacerouters with  cheaper SDN solutions.Cisco's data center revenue also fell 7% to $790 million due   to the ""blade to rack"" shift in which enterprise consumers are   favoring smaller, cheaper, and more scalable rack servers over   pricier, higher-powered blade servers.Lastly, Cisco's guidance was mediocre at best. For the current   quarter, it expects -2% to break-even revenue growth with   non-GAAP earnings of $0.57-$0.59, which would be nearly flat from   prior year levels. Analysts expect its revenue to  fall 2%   and earnings to grow 1% for the full year.But it's all about the valuations...Based on those numbers, it seems odd that Cisco is hovering   near a 16-year high. However, Cisco's P/E of 18 is actually much   lower than its industry average of 25 and the S&P 500's P/E   of 25. Moreover, the last time Cisco's P/E was at 18 (in early   2015), it traded in the upper $20s -- indicating the stock isn't   as expensive as its long-term price chart makes it look.When we combine that low valuation with Cisco's recent   dividend hike, the stock has a good balance between a low   valuation and a high yield -- which has become increasingly rare   in today's frothy market. Therefore, investors shouldn't be   thrilled by Cisco's lackluster top and bottom line growth, but   they should realize that it's still a cheap and dependable income   play.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Cisco - With Jasper Technologies - Plans To Expand The Internet Of Things;3/2/2017;"When Cisco (CSCO) acquired Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion a year ago, it was with the intent to make Internet of Things (IoT) simple and scalable.At the time of acquisition, Jasper had over 3,500 enterprises - a number that has grown to 9,000 while the devices under management has shot up from 17 million to more than 40 million, exhibiting its increased adoption driven by its diverse IoT use cases. Recently, Cisco made some exciting announcements at the Mobile World Congress to expand its reach in the IoT space while showcasing its offerings to businesses.Cisco-Jasper offers a platform that not only connects ‘things’ but also collects and analyzes data to provide scalable solutions to resolve long-standing challenges across industries such as automotive, logistics and transportation, energy, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, smart cities, homes and buildings, agriculture and payment solutions. The IoT solutions by Cisco-Jasper provide an opportunity to improve productivity, enhance revenue, lower operational costs, expand product offerings and even access newer markets.makeArticleAd();NB-IoTCisco is now one of the first IoT platforms to support NB-IoT (Narrow-Band IoT), a step taken in response to the rising demand by companies for low-cost, low-power IoT devices. Ciscobelievesthat “NB-IoT is expected to drive growth of IoT at a massive scale, increasing the number of connected devices more than 3 billion by 2023.”In other words, the NB-IoT protocol is ideal for smart meters, smart cities, smart parking, building automation, asset tracking and remote agriculture. The market size for NB-IoT is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 91.3%, from $320.5 million in 2017 to $8.22 billion by 2022, as perestimates.Healthcare WearablesCisco hascollaboratedwith Jupl to promote safety and wellness among the elderly population by launching a wearable mobile Personal Emergency Response System (mPERS). The wearable device works without a smartphone and will leverage the “Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch and purpose-built software from Jupl.” Thedatafor December quarter suggests that 15.6% of consumers in the U.S. own a smartwatch or fitness band.These devices, managed via the Cisco Jasper Control Center IoT platform, will serve the purpose of a Personal Emergency Response System (PERS) (which means it can automatically notify emergency services as well as healthcare professionals) and enable biometric monitoring, thereby taking care of the user’s vitals as well as provide location tracking and assistance.This segment of IoT has immense scope as the global IoT healthcare market (medical devices, systems & software, and services) is estimated to reach nearly $410 billion by 2022 from $58.9 billion in 2014, as per areport.Connected CarsConnected car is a subset of the overall IoT segment which is gaining significant popularity among automakers given their potential to add billions in revenue. According to a PwCreport, the global car market has the potential to build considerable value from the sale of connected car packages to end customers - $155.9 billion in 2022, up from $52.5 billion in 2017, growing at an average annual growth rate of 24.3% subject to certain factors.Cisco enjoys the first-mover advantage in the connected car space and is endorsed by more than 23 of the world’s largest auto manufacturers. Now, Cisco Jasper IoT solutions will power Honda’s Connected Car platform – MyHonda - inassociationwith Bright Box. Honda will provide benefits such as vehicle information and diagnostics, simple scheduling of maintenance as well as GPS tracking for location-based services through the MyHonda Connected Car platform.Final WordCurrently, IoT enjoys the fastest adoption rate among most advanced technologies. With projections of 22.5 billion IoT devices in 2021 (from 6.6 billion in 2016) with $4.8 trillion in aggregate IoT investment between 2016 and 2021, the IoT space is the next big thing. Cisco’s ecosystem of strong cyber security systems, cloud and IoT offerings makes Cisco Jasper one of the most suited IoT platforms for businesses across industries.“The Internet of Things: It's not about things, it's about service,” says Cisco. Internet of things will give a whole new dimension to the world around us and to the balance sheets of the businesses and providers such as Cisco."

Better Buy: Cisco Systems Inc. vs. Oracle Corp.;3/1/2017;"BothCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andOracle(NYSE: ORCL) have been under scrutiny from investors as they   navigate through significant business transitions. For Cisco, the   ongoing transformation means less reliance on its legacy routers   and switches business, and a greater focus on cloud-based   security solutions, enterprise communications, and the Internet   of Things (IoT).Though it took Oracle co-founder and current CTO Larry Ellison   a while to get aboard the cloud bandwagon, his company has   finally done so, and that's beginning to pay significant   dividends. Last quarter marked the first time Oracle's cloud   sales topped the magic $1 billion plateau. However, Oracle's   cloud results come with a caveat.So of these two veteran tech majors looking to capitalize on   the next waves of change, which is the better buy?makeArticleAd();Oracle headquarters Image source: OracleThe case for OracleBased on its year-over-year results, Oracle's second quarter   was close to a home run. Each of its key cloud units --   software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and   infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) -- performed admirably.The hands-down leaders in terms of revenue growth were   Oracle's SaaS and PaaS units, which together climbed a whopping    81% to $878 million. Yes, that's a mere fraction of   Oracle's total sales -- which were flat year-over-year at $9   billion -- but it's a  fraction that's growing larger with   each passing quarter.The aforementioned $1 billion-plus in cloud sales includes the   $175 million in IaaS revenue Oracle generated last quarter, good   for a meager 6% improvement -- which represents a tremendous   opportunity. Combined with infrastructure software, IaaS and   related software generated an estimated  $471 billion last   year with the majority -- $294 billion -- from IaaS alone.Which begs the question: Why is Oracle seemingly putting such   a significant opportunity on the back burner? The upside   potential in its cloud software business is also significant, but   at these relatively early stages, Oracle shouldn't leave anything   cloud-related unexploited.All the positive cloud news has been good for Oracle stock,   pushing its share price up 10% in 2017, but there's a caveat.   Oracle's late arrival to the cloud translates to awfully tame   comparables, so investors would be wise to take that into account   before over-celebrating.Cisco IoT. Image source: CiscoThe case for CiscoThough the cloud and related solutions are also on Cisco's   radar, it's the focus on IoT and the fast-growing data security   markets that will drive this company's long-term growth. The good   news is that Cisco is making inroads in both key areas, which it   demonstrated yet again the past couple of days.Connected cars are one avenue of IoT growth, and Cisco is   among a host of providers going all in to win market share as   suppliers to the auto industry. Its recent deal withHondato power its new connected car platform is the latest in a   string of wins for Cisco in a market  expected to grow to   more than $46 billion in three years. So Cisco is moving the   needle with its efforts in two of the fastest growing areas of   IoT -- the other being smart cities. Better still, its work to   dominate data security could give it a position that surpasses   even its IoT ambitions.As with Oracle's cloud results, Cisco's strong data security   growth should be viewed in context. Through the first two   quarters of Cisco's fiscal 2017, security sales have climbed    13% to $1.07 billion. That's a small fraction of Cisco's   $23.9 billion in total revenue, but therein lies the opportunity.   One report  suggests data security spending will reach $1   trillion between now and 2021, and Cisco is leading the   charge.Cisco expects there will be 26.3 billion connected devices   globally in 2020, which is why its new ""security architecture for   mobile service providers"" solution is such a timely addition to   its offerings. Targeting telecoms with data security solutions in   an increasingly mobile, digitized world is a no-brainer for it.   And Cisco's new mobile security platform has already gained a   number of fans among some of the leading telecoms on the   planet.The envelope pleaseSo which is the better buy, Oracle or Cisco? Both are sound,   long-term plays, but given Cisco's 3.4% dividend yield --   Oracle's is 1.4% -- and its early leadership position in IoT and   data security, each of which could dwarf the opportunities in the   highly competitive cloud market, over the long haul, Cisco gets   the nod.10 stocks we like better than OracleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

The figure was significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 38 cents.The stock has gone down roughly 15.6%, underperforming the Zacks categorizedIT Servicesindustry's gain of 17.4% in the past one year.Quarter DetailsThough Palo Alto Networks' revenues of $422.6 million surged 26.3% year over year, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $430 million. Moreover, the quarterly revenues came below the guided range of $426 million to $432 million, primarily due to weak go-to-market execution.Product revenues decreased a marginal 0.6% to $168.8 million. The company saw a 54% surge in subscription and support revenues ($253.8 million). SaaS-based subscription revenues climbed 59% from the year-ago period. Support revenues increased 48% year over year.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 28% and represented 69% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) went up 27%, accounting for 19% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 14% and brought in the balance.Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base supported quarterly revenues. Moreover, billings jumped 22% year over year to $561.6 million during the quarter.Palo Alto Networks' gross margin increased 130 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 71.9%, primarily backed by growth in both recurring subscription and support gross margins.The company reported an adjusted operating loss of $42 million, which widened from a loss of $40 million suffered a year ago. GAAP operating loss during the quarter came in at $54.4 million compared with a loss of $50.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 25% year over year) also impacted operating results.The company's non-GAAP net loss was $59.6 million, wider than a loss of $39.5 million reported last year. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $60.6 million compared with a loss of $57.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.354 billion compared with $1.390 billion in the previous quarter.Receivables were $386.1 million compared with $346.5 million in the last quarter. Palo Alto Networks' balance sheet does not have any long-term debt. The company reported cash flow from operations of $214.3 million during the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $169.6 million during the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 900k shares worth $132 million.GuidanceFor the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in a range of $406 million to $416 million, up 17% to 20% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $453 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 54 cents to 56 cents (excluding stock-based compensation expenses but including the impact of LightCyberacquisition).The company continues to expect fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $2.45 to $2.50.Recent ActivitiesPalo Alto Networks recently announced the buyout of LightCyber for $105 million. The acquisition will expand the company's Next-Generation Security Platform. We believe that this acquisition will not only increase its capabilities but the customer base as well.Our TakePalo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided a tepid revenue guidance for the forthcoming quarter.Nonetheless, revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base are the other positives. We believe that the company's product refreshes and acquisitions synergies will boost revenues, going forward.The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Earnings on Tap: What to Expect?;2/28/2017;"Can Palo Alto Networks (PANW) win back investors’ trust? That’s the company’s main objective when the cyber security and anti-hacking specialist reports second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday.Once a Wall Street darling, the company has suffered growing pains over the past couple of years, thanks to increased competition from the likes of Cisco (CSCO) and Fortinet (FTNT), whose products have enhanced their offerings due to R&D and — in some cases — acquisitions. These moves have pressured Palo Alto’s best-of-breed status. The California-based company has posted only in-line results in two of its previous three reporting periods, while revenue growth has decelerated for almost 60% to 34% last quarter.Palo Alto stock closed Monday at $153.95, up 0.61%. The stock has rebounded strongly since reaching a 52-week low of $114.64. But with better-than-expected results recently released from security software peers Check Point (CHKP), Palo Alto has more to worry about than just the aforementioned Cisco and Fortinet. Investors now want to know if the stock's hot streak can continue or if taking profits would be the better move.makeArticleAd();For the three months that ended January, Wall Street expects Palo Alto to deliver adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents, which would rise 44% year over year, while revenue of $429.6 million would risen 28% year over year. For the full year that ends July, earnings are projected to rise 66% year over year to $2.78 per share, while revenue of $1.8 billion would rise 30.70%.Despite the strong 28% projected revenue growth for the quarter, this would mark another growth deceleration of six percentage points from the third quarter. And this is why investors have gotten gun-shy. The stock was punished in November after the company’s billings, which refers to sales that had not closed, missed expectations.Billings is a closely-watched metric that underscores the strength of future business. Notably, the billings miss arrived even as the rate at which cyber threats continue to climb. To the extent Palo Alto’s weak first-quarter billings manifest into higher revenue and billings in the second quarter, these shares may yet be a bargain. But it makes more sense to not only wait for the actual results to be announced, but also hear what Palo Alto forecasts in terms of corporate security spending in 2017."

The 5 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors;2/27/2017;"According toFinviz.com, there are currently more than 3,500 publicly traded stocks that   pay a dividend. That's an overwhelming number that can make it   difficult for a new investor to get started.To help you narrow down your selection, we asked a team of   Fools to each pick a stock they think is a great choice for a   beginner. They chooseWaste Management(NYSE: WM) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,American Express(NYSE: AXP) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andCostco(NASDAQ: COST) . Read on to find out why.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The benefits of buying disruption-proof     businessesTyler Crowe(Waste Management):One of the things beginning investors should learn when making   their first dividend investment is how to identify companies in   essential functions of our everyday lives with nearly   insurmountable competitive advantages over their competition.   These are the kinds of companies that will have the pricing power   to grow revenue and profits for decades to come, and return   considerable value to shareholders.One company that fits this mold incredibly well is refuse   handler Waste Management. The company is the largest refuse   collection company, and it has a large network of landfills,   disposal centers, and recycling facilities across the U.S. The   waste-handling business inherently has lots of competitive   advantages for its well-established players. It's extremely   capital-intensive to build out a fleet of waste collection   vehicles, there are lots of regulatory hurdles involved in   opening new landfills and maintaining existing ones, and it's   extremely difficult to disrupt how humans generate and handle   waste. These things combine to give Waste Management a very   favorable operating environment where it can pass along rising   costs to customers pretty easily and generate a steady stream of   profits.For years, Waste Management has taken these competitive   advantages and turned them into a very shareholder-friendly   business. For more than a decade, the company has steadily raised   its dividend payments and bought back shares to generate high   rates of return in what many would consider a slow-growth   business.WM Return on Equity (TTM)data byYCharts.For beginning investors, companies with huge competitive   advantages like Waste Management are a great lesson in why it   pays to hang onto stocks for the long term. The company's share   price gains will never blow anyone's socks off, but its high   rates of return in an industry that will likely be around for   decades will reward those who hold onto their position.The transition is workingBrian Feroldi(Microsoft):I'm a firm believer that new dividend investors should seek out   big, highly profitable companies for their first investment. That   criteria perfectly describes Microsoft, which is why I think it's   a fantastic stock for beginners.Microsoft has been cranking out profits for decades thanks to   its stranglehold on the software industry. Products such as   Windows and Office are cash cows that have been a dependable   source of revenue for decades. That should hold true for a long   time to come.However, Microsoft's stock stagnated for years over worries   that the ever-changing tech world would render this company's   products obsolete. Thankfully, that worry got put to rest when   Satya Nadella took over the top chair in 2014. CEO Nadella   has placed an emphasis on moving Microsoft's products into the   cloud, a decision that's paying off handsomely as revenue from   products like Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics CRM Online are   surging. When you add in the growth of other product lines such   as Xbox, Bing, and Surface, Microsoft's bottom line has been   posting healthy gains in recent years.Looking ahead, market watchers believe Microsoft's bottom line   will grow by more than 9% annually over the next five years. That   seems realistic when combining the growth in cloud product sales   with its recently completed acquisition of LinkedIn. Add to that   the company's rock-solid dividend yield of 2.4%, and I can't help   but think Microsoft is a terrific stock for new dividend   investors to buy.Buy one of Buffett's favorites at a great valueJasonHall(American Express):Warren Buffett first bought shares of American Express when the   company's stock was selling for bargain prices. Decades later,   those shares are worth almost 10 times whatBerkshire Hathawaypaid -- but that's only the tip of the iceberg of what American   Express means for Buffett and Berkshire today.At the current $0.32 per share quarterly dividend, American   Express will pay Berkshire almost $195 million in dividends in   2017. That may seem like a paltry yield on its $12 billion stake,   but when we look at the yield on cost -- that is, how much   American Express' dividend pays based on the original investment   -- the math is much better: Berkshire gets paid a roughly 15%   yield on its cost for those AmEx shares. And with its prospects   and track record, that payout is likely to keep growing for years   to come.There's a wonderful lesson for beginning investors: Don't skip   the small-yielding stocks if you're looking for dividends.   Sometimes your best choice is one like American Express, which   has spent far more time yielding below 2% of its market price   than above 3%, but it has steadily and regularly raised its   dividend for decades:AXP Dividenddata byYCharts.Don't let today's paltry yield cause you to miss an excellent   dividend growth stock. American Express stock is cheap today,   trading near 14 times last year's earnings. And with its track   record of dividend growth, it could be paying you 15% or more on   your original investment in a couple of decades.The company at the core of our digital worldChuck Saletta(Cisco Systems):Cisco is the ubiquitous networking giant responsible for many of   the high-speed routers and switches that move financial   transactions, videos, pictures, and text all over the internet.   It's also establishing itself as a strong dividend player with   both a decent history of increasing its dividend and reasonable   room to continue raising it going forward. That combination sets   it up as a great potential investment for someone just now   dipping into the realm of dividend investing.Cisco paid its first dividend of $0.06 per share per quarter   in 2011, and it has been increasing it since then. The company's   current yield is almost 3.5%, which is a decent premium over   the general market. It recently raised its dividend from $0.26   per share per quarter to $0.29, an increase of 11.5%. Even with   that increase, Cisco pays out only around half of its earnings in   the form of dividends, which gives it room to continue increasing   those dividends as its business grows over time.Speaking of that growth, over the next five years, analysts   expect Cisco to be able to increase its earnings by almost 11%   per year. If it does manage to grow at that pace, and its   dividends follow suit, investors will receive around $0.48 per   share per quarter five years from now. That's the true power of a   strong dividend investing strategy.Learn from a greatJordan Wathen(Costco):Warehouse retailer Costco is neither cheap nor especially   high-yielding, but it is the kind of company I'd recommend to a   friend as a company to follow and learn from.Costco has more traits of the ""greats"" than perhaps any other   company. For one, it has the advantage of efficient scale, which   results from the fact it generates about $120 billion in revenue   from just 4,000 products, thus frequently making Costco its   suppliers' single-largest customer. That gives it power at the   negotiating table.It's also ridiculously good at managing its balance sheet.   Costco manages to sell its inventory before the bill even comes   due.Oh -- and it somehow created a cult following thatForbesonce dubbed ""Costcoholics"" for the fact that its loyalists visit   the store several times a week to see what's new. Not many   retailers have rabid fans of their off-label brands, but Costco   does.Let's get back to the dividend. Costco's current yield of 1%   understates its heft as a dividend stock. I think it's likely   that dividends will grow at a double-digit clip for years to   come, as its earnings power increases and it pays out a greater   percentage of earnings to its shareholders. What's more   important, especially for beginner investors, is the opportunity   to use the company as a case study to learn about what separates   the good businesses from the great businesses.10 stocks we like better than Costco WholesaleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA): Be Cautious and Earn a Double-Digit Return;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's little doubt 2016 was a downer forTeva PharmaceuticalsIndustries Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) shareholders. Nevertheless, there's reason to believe 2017 could be time to forgive and forget - or at least give TEVA stock some benefit of the doubt. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler (Modified)It's no secret, there's been a lot factors weighing on TEVA stock over the past year. For one, new debt tied to its acquisition ofAllergan plc Ordinary Shares'(NYSE:AGN) generic business for a hefty $40.5 billion has been one thorn with some investors.For many other shareholders, though, a price-fixing scandal, tied-at-the-hip resignation of its CEO and restructuring of management has been a definite drag on shares of TEVA. And if that weren't enough to pressure TEVA stock, investors have also been bracing for the imminent loss of patent protection for Teva's key non-generic multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone.The good news at this point is there's been a lot of bad news and it's likely much of the collateral damage has been priced in with shares off around 45% over the last year. Even better, Teva Pharmaceuticals should be in position to ultimately right itself.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsFor all the problems Teva Pharmaceuticals has faced, it needs to be remembered that Teva is also the world's largest generics company. And in a business demanding of scale and industry expertise to succeed, Teva Pharmaceuticals maintains that critical advantage.The biggest also just got bigger. In acquiring the Actavis generic unit from Allergan, TEVA stock saw its Q4 sales jump by 33% to $6.5 billion. As well and despite the additional debt from the deal, Teva Pharmaceutical did manage tobring in $4.3 billion in free cash flowthis past year.Not only is TEVA stock in position to support a healthy 3.8% dividend, but as a well-funded payout, there's room for increases, too. Shares also trade at a low eight times trailing free cash flow and management expects it can cut operating expenses by roughly $1.4 billion over the next couple years.Bottom line, I'd guess Teva Pharmaceuticals would gladly take a mulligan regarding its price-fixing scandal if it could. More importantly, with a recent $1 billion settlement with authorities, changes happening in the C-suite and value rearing its head off and on the TEVA price chart; it could be time to forgive and forget.TEVA Stock Monthly ChartClick to EnlargeIn looking at the monthly chart of TEVA stock, the case for a value play in shares can certainly be made.Since hitting an all-time-high less than two years ago, TEVA is off a bit more than 50%. The hard correction also sets itself up as a two-step or mirror move with leg AB matching leg CD as shown on the price chart.TEVA is also showing some value as the current price is wedged between the 50% to 62% retracement levels dating back to a cycle low in 1998, while marginally breaching key pivot lows in 2008 and 2011.A potential monthly doji ""decision"" candle that's taking shape as we enter the last days of February is another sign a bottom could be forming.Yet, weaker price and stochastic behavior on the daily and weekly time-frames (not shown) has this strategist modestly cautious on buying TEVA stock right now.TEVA Stock Credit Put SpreadGiven what's been presented and after reviewing TEVA's stock options, the 17 March $34/$32.50 credit put spread is attractive and better than simply forgiving and forgetting about a stock position.With shares at $35.38 the out-of-the-money vertical is priced for a credit of 34 cents within the quoted market. If TEVA stock is above $34 at expiration the sold premium amounts to a return of 29% for a less-than-one-month holding period.The return represents the equivalent of taking in the quarterly dividend of 34 cents in TEVA, which incidentally is going ex-dividend Tuesday. The better news, rather than owning TEVA stock outright, is the vertical spread allows for a decline or margin of safety of nearly 5% before the strategy is doing worse than breaking even at $33.66.The vertical also has the advantage of limiting the investor's risk to $1.16, regardless of how low TEVA might go during the life of the spread. And if shares do move aggressively lower, stock can always be acquired through assignment or closing the spread and purchasing shares.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Is in a Rut, and Income Investors Love ItUsing this type strategy, the most an investor would pay for TEVA is $33.66. It also ensures an effective purchase price is never more than $1.16 above the current price of TEVA stock during the life of the spread.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Is in a Rut, and Income Investors Love It;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) has justdelivered second-quarter FY17 earningsthat beat expectations on Wall Street, but once again proved that Cisco stock will not be returning to growth any time soon.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockCisco reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6 billion, $50 million above Wall Street consensus estimate, but -1.7% year-over-year. That marked the fifth straight quarter that the company has posted falling revenue.Sadly, things appears set to remain that way for at least the next few quarters. After all, Cisco guided to revenue growth of -2% to breakeven for the current quarter, and sees non-GAAP per-share earnings coming in at 57 cents 59 cents, in line with Wall Street's consensus of 58 cents.Oddly enough, Cisco stock has tucked on gains of 6% since the earnings call, reversing the selloff that happened immediately after the results. Cisco stock is now up a solid 13.3% year-to-date. So why, pray, are investors celebrating Cisco's revenue tailspin?Business Model Transition for Cisco StockCSCO is stuck in the throes of a serious business model transition. Since its early days, the company has been in the business of selling switches and routers that move data around the internet. That's still true in a big way since the company still derives more than 40% of its revenue from this networking business.But with more and more companies relying on rented computing services from the likes ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), they are buying less and less of Cisco's hardware for their data centers.Even worse is the fact that when they do buy, they are upgrading to newer devices less often. Further, Cisco is increasingly facing tougher competition and cheaper offerings from the likes ofArista Networks Inc(NYSE:ANET), a company that was founded by former top Cisco executives.Throw in the fact that more companies are experimenting with software-defined networking (SDN), and Cisco is finding itself caught between a rock and hard place. Last quarter's results say it all: Cisco's switching and routing revenue for the quarter fell 5%  and 10% to $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.But CSCO has, over the past few years, been working on a grand plan that involves pushing for a recurring subscription-based revenue model. This essentially means developing businesses that will protect it from the vagaries of the boom-and-bust cycles of its core business.Chief executive Chuck Robbins is optimistic that Cisco can leverage the lessons gleaned from its subscription-based businesses, such as Meraki cloud-controlled WiFi, Security software and Collaboration to build a solid subscription revenue businesses. Cisco's Security segment was the brightest spot in the earnings report after growing 14% to reach $528 million. Meanwhile the Collaboration business grew 4% to hit $1,062 million.Investors were pleased with Cisco's latest report is because it showed that the company is making progress discovering new recurring revenue streams. The company announced that product deferred revenue related to software and subscriptions grew 51% to reach $4 billion. Meanwhile, 10% of its $9 billion Product sales is now of a recurring nature, up from virtually zero a couple of years ago.Cash Cow and Dividend MachineFor all its troubles, Cisco remains by far the most dominant player in the networking business, something that has helped the company preserve its fat margins. During the last quarter, the company's Product gross margin decreased from 63.4% to 61.1%, but its Services gross margin increased from 65.1% to 67.7%. Improving margins is a good sign that the company's pricing power remains undiminished.Healthy margins have allowed CSCO stock to become a cash cow, with annual free cash flow approaching $13 billion. Cisco spends a lot of this cash on M&A activity. During the latest earnings call, Cisco announced that it was taking AppDynamics off the IPO table by doling out $3.7 billion for the application performance management startup. But income investors need not worry - in the same vein, Cisco announced that it was hiking its quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 29 cents.Cisco stock now yields a generous 3.5%, among the highest yields in theDow Jones Industrial Average.Bottom Line for Cisco StockCisco instituted the dividend six years ago when it declared a quarterly payout of 6 cents, good for a modest 1.4% yield. Since then, the company has hiked dividends at least once every year.Cisco is also sitting atop a cash hoard north of $60 billion, most of it stashed in overseas accounts. With the Trump administration looking to quickly enact legislation to lower corporate tax from 35% to 15% to 20%, Cisco will be in a position to repatriate at least some of that cash and continue rewarding investors.Mobile World Congress: Apple Inc. (AAPL) vs. Everyone ElseThe 10-year Treasury note has been rising, but at 2.52% remains well below the yield by Cisco stock. With such a healthy backdrop, Cisco stock remains a prime long-term holding especially for income investors.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right Now7 Food Stocks That Will Deliver Tasty ReturnsThe postCisco Systems, Inc.

3 Internet of Things Stocks That Could Double Your Money;2/27/2017;"The Internet of Things (IoT), which connects wearables, smart   appliances, cars, and other gadgets to each other and the cloud,   is widely expected to be the next big growth market for   chipmakers. Networking giantCiscoestimates that the number of connected devices worldwide   will  double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion in 2020   -- indicating that early movers in the market could reap big   rewards over the next few years.Many tech companies have highlighted the IoT market as a major   growth opportunity, but it can be tough for investors to narrow   down the best long-term plays. Today, we'll take a look at three   IoT stocks which could potentially double over the next few years   --Sierra Wireless(NASDAQ: SWIR) ,Skyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) , andSTMicroelectronics(NYSE: STM) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Sierra WirelessSierra Wireless is the world's biggest manufacturer of 2G, 3G,   and 4G embedded modules and gateways. Since these components are   required for most machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, Sierra   is often regarded as a ""pure play"" on the IoT market. Sierra   faces rising competition from cheaper chipmakers, especially in   China, but the company has scaled up over the past few years by   acquiring smaller wireless connectivity players like AnyData,   Maingate, Mobiquithings, and GenX Mobile.Sierra recently broke a four-quarter streak of annual revenue   declines with 13% sales growth in the fourth quarter, which   helped it post 1% top line growth for fiscal 2016. That growth   doesn't sound impressive, but analysts expect Sierra's revenue   and non-GAAP earnings to respectively grow 7% and 22% this year   as enterprise spending accelerates, macro headwinds fade, and   competition from Chinese competitors wanes.Sierra's low valuation indicates that its price could   eventually double. Its EV/Sales ratio of 1.2 isverylow relative to larger chipmakers likeTexas Instruments, which has an EV/Sales ratio of 5.8. With an enterprise value of   just over $600 million, it's also a lucrative takeover target for   any tech company that wants to instantly establish a   market-leading position in the M2M modules market.Skyworks SolutionsSkyworks Solutions supplies RF (radio frequency) chips for the   mobile, automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, home   automation, industrial, and military markets. These chips are   also widely used for M2M communications. Skyworks is primarily   known as anApplesupplier, and Oppenheimer & Co. previously estimated that as   much as 40% of its annual revenue came from chips for   iDevices.Image source: Skyworks.But looking ahead, Skyworks believes that higher sales of RF   chips for IoT products like connected cars, smart home   appliances, and wearables will eventually offset the weight of   its mobile chips business. Skyworks' quarterly revenue has dipped   annually for three straight quarters, but analysts believe that   it will return to positive growth this quarter and post 9% sales   growth for the full year thanks to robust iPhone orders and   rising demand for IoT products.Its non-GAAP earnings are also expected to improve 12% this   year, partly due to a new $500 million buyback plan authorized in   January. Skyworks trailing P/E of 19 is already lower than its   industry average of 22, but its forward P/E of 14 looks even   cheaper. That low valuation indicates that the stock could rise   much higher over the next few years.STMicroelectronicsSTMicroelectronics, the largest chipmaker in Europe,   manufactures a wide variety of chips for the automotive,   industrial, security, and consumer electronics industries. Its   automotive business is its largest unit, and has been lifted by   rising demand for connected infotainment and navigation systems   in higher-end vehicles. It also sells motion sensors for mobile   devices and consumer electronics.STMicro's revenue has risen annually for the past two   quarters, which  broke amulti-yearstreak of revenue declines. That turnaround can be attributed to   soaring demand for automotive chips and analog chips and sensors   for consumer electronics, which offset weaker sales of   microcontrollers and digital ICs. Analysts expect STMicro's   revenue to rise 8% this year, and its non-GAAP earnings are   expected to rise 128% on its return to top line growth.STMicro trades at 20 times forward earnings, which only seems   like a slight discount to the industry average of 22 for broad   line semiconductor makers. However, analysts expect STMicro's   earnings to grow at an average rate of 49% per year over the next   five years -- which gives it a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.5. Since a   PEG ratio under 1 is considered undervalued, STMicro looks very   cheap relative to its long-term earnings growth potential. That   low valuation also makes STMicro a very lucrative takeover target   for bigger chipmakers that want to diversify into automotive   chips.The key takeawaySierra Wireless, Skyworks, and STMicro should all benefit from   the growth of the IoT market, and their low valuations indicate   that they have room to grow. I don't believe that these three   stocks will double within a few quarters, but I think that they   might do so over several years as demand for their components   heats up.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Stock Valuation Metrics Every Investor Should Know;2/27/2017;"Whether you're just beginning to invest or are a seasoned   investor, evaluating stocks can be a daunting task, due in part   to the hundreds of metrics out for gauging a company's worth.   However, while the number of metrics may make investing look   complicated, not all of them are truly useful when you're looking   for stocks worthy of your money and time.To help you invest better, we asked our contributors to   explain the three most important valuation metrics that every   investor should understand: the price-to-earnings ratio,   enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio, and price-to-cash flow   ratio.P/E ratio: An easy-to-use, useful metricKeith Noonan(Price-to-earnings ratio):The price-to-earnings ratio is one of the most common metrics for   evaluating a stock, and while it's not a helpful indicator in   every scenario, it can provide insights on how the market values   a company's earnings.makeArticleAd();As the name implies, the P/E ratio is derived by taking the   price of a share of stock, and dividing it by the annualized   earnings per share. This value can then be compared to other   P/Es, whether of an index, industry, or an individual company. A   relatively low P/E may be an indication that a stock is   undervalued compared to its earnings, while a high P/E might   suggest the opposite. As an example,Cisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) forward P/E of roughly 14 suggests the stock is   inexpensive when compared to the networking and communications   hardware sector's average of 24.7 and theS&P 500's average forward earnings multiple of roughly 18.Confused about valuation metrics? Knowing the important ones     helps. Image source: Getty ImagesP/E ratios are used to evaluate price in comparison to both   past performance and anticipated returns. Trailing-12-month P/E   is calculated using actual earnings over the last four quarterly   reporting periods, while forward P/E typically is derived using   expected earnings over the next fiscal year or 12-month period.   Stock prices are forward looking, and past performance won't   necessarily be repeated, so forward P/E is often a better    indicator than trailing P/E. However, the company guidance   and analyst expectations used to estimate future earnings often   disagree, and both can be inaccurateP/E ratios can be useful tools, but they won't provide   meaningful insights in every situation. Companies that are young   or otherwise undergoing periods of rapid expansion or high   spending might have small profits or still be posting losses, and   price-to-earnings ratios don't provide a useful point of   comparison for the value of an equity in these instances.   Earnings can also be affected by accounting practices and other   factors, so digging deeper into a company's operations and   financials and using other metrics to supplement the information   presented by P/E values is essential.EV/FCF ratio: A metric that matters to business ownersChuck Saletta(Enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio): When you own a company outright, you care about your total   capital structure -- your debtandyour equity. You also care deeply about how much cash the company   is generating, as cash is frequently much more valuable to a   business than accounting profits are. That combination is what   makes the enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio such a   powerful one to look at for investors who want to act and think   like owners rather than speculators.Start with the enterprise value side of that ratio. To   calculate the enterprise value for a company, start with its   market capitalization, thensubtractany cash and equivalents andaddany debt, minority interest, and preferred shares.  That   basically tells you what the market is valuing the company at in   a takeover situation, as any new owners would benefit from its   cash or be responsible for its debts.While there's no official definition of free cash flow, a   common approach to calculating it is to start with a company's   cash from operations and subtract any capital expenses. Cash from   operations measures how much cash a company generates from   running its business, while the capital expenses acknowledge that   generating that cash generally requires ongoing investments in   growth and renewal of equipment.Calculate the enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio by   dividing the enterprise value number by the free cash flow   number. The ratio can be more valuable in some situations than   the more common P/E ratio, as it looks at the bigger picture of   things that typically matter more to true owners.The table below shows how you would calculate the ratio for   technology giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Note that Apple's EV/FCF ratio of 14.8 is below   its price to earnings ratio of 16.3. Since Apple carries more   debt than it has cash and equivalents, that lower EV/FCF ratio   indicates that Apple is doing a strong job of converting the   revenue in takes in into cold, hard cash.MetricAmount (in Billions)Market Capitalization$712.06Cash and Equivalents$16.37Debt$87.55Enterprise Value$783.24Cash from Operations$65.42Capital Expenditures$12.46Free Cash Flow$52.96EV/FCF Ratio14.8Table by the authorStill, the usefulness of the EV/FCF ratio to investors has   limits. Chief among them is that unless you have enough of a   stake to truly influence the company's use of its cash and   capital structure, you have no control over with it will   appropriately use its cash or avoid overleveraging on debt. In   addition, the free cash flow number can be juiced in the short   term by underinvesting in maintenance expenditures. Those   short-term gains can lead to long-term pain as equipment   ages.Despite those limits, the enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow   ratio is an incredibly useful metric for investors who want to   view their investments through the lens of the business owner.   Even if you don't control what the company does with its cash,   you can at least use changes in the numbers that make up that   measure over time to help you judge whether you think its   management is putting its cash to good use. And that's a number   worthy of the time it takes you to calculate and track it.P/CF ratio: Loss-making companies can be valuable tooNeha Chamaria(Price-to-cash-flow ratio): My fellow Fool Keith Noonan rightly pointed out how popular the   P/E ratio is as a valuation metric, but as he also stated,   several factors can impact earnings. More importantly, earnings,   as reflected on profit-and-loss statements, can be manipulated by   way of non-cash expenses, distorting the true picture of a   company's financial health.What matters more to investors is a company's operating cash   flow, which excludes non-cash items to reflect the actual cash a   company generates from core operations. After all, it is this   cash that the company uses to pay debts, reinvest in the   business, or return to shareholders via dividends and share   buybacks. That is why I always consider cash flow while analyzing   a company, and price-to-cash-flow ratio when valuing a stock.To compute the P/CF ratio, all you have to do is divide a   company's stock price by its cash flow per share. To derive that,   simply look up the company's cash flow statement to find its cash   from operations or net cash provided by operating activities, and   divide that by the number of shares outstanding to get the cash   flow per share. While there's no standard to define an   ""attractive"" P/CF, a lower ratio is generally better when looking   for value stocks.More often than not, a stock that you may write off as pricey   based on its P/E ratio could prove a lot more attractive in terms   of P/CF, as appears to be the case with the broader markets right   now. Here's a solid example to help you understand why:Caterpillar Inc.(NYSE: CAT) .The heavy-equipment manufacturer's stock has soared a   staggering 50% in the past year, as of this writing. Given the   persistent headwinds in the mining and oil and gas sectors,   Caterpillar's rally and the consistent flow of ratings upgrades   from analysts have left many investors bewildered. After all, how   can a company with a trailing P/E of 88 or a forward P/E of 33 be   undervalued -- especially if its earnings are expected to decline   this year?Enter the P/CF ratio. You'll be surprised to see how   dramatically different things suddenly appear when you measure   Caterpillar's based on its P/CF.CAT PE Ratio (TTM)data byYChartsAt only 10 times P/CF, Caterpillar is anything but overvalued.   While Caterpillar's net earnings have slumped in recent years, it   continues to generate strong cash flow. For perspective,   Caterpillar generated almost $5.6 billion in operating cash flow   compared to net losses worth $59 million during the trailing 12   months. That also explains how Caterpillar has maintained its   dividends despite plunging profits.Of course, no valuation metric is foolproof, including the   P/CF ratio, but it's especially useful in analyzing companies   that aren't profitable or have taken big hits to their bottom   lines primarily because of macro factors, as is the case with   Caterpillar. You could even go a step further and use the   price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. (Psst... Caterpillar isn't   insanely valued on a P/FCF basis either. Don't believe me? Go   compute the ratio now that you've learned about cash flows.)10 stocks we like better than CaterpillarWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Watch Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock for This Warning Sign;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) have rallied roughly 8% since Feb. 10 without much of a breather. CSCO stock now increasingly looks to be in need of a pause as it has bumped into a key technical area of resistance, before it may stand a better chance again of resuming its multi-year up-trend.makeArticleAd();Before looking at Cisco's charts below, allow me to remind ye faithful of the importance of understanding the correlation among stocks.Unlike other asset classes - such as commodities and to some extent currencies - stocks in general tend to be highly correlated. While the price of pork bellies has little correlation with, say, the price movement in crude oil (both commodities), about 80% of stocks on average tend to move up and down together.In other words, on down days in the stock market about eight out of ten stocks on average will tend to drop, and vice versa on up days. This statistic holds particularly true in strong up or down trends, such as what we have witnessed on the upside since the U.S. election results from last November.Looking at the current juncture in the stock market as represented by theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY), we see a broader stock market that has not had a down day of 1% or more in about three months and that from a momentum perspective looks well exhausted.As I always say, markets can continue trending in one direction or another regardless of overbought or oversold readings, yet the odds of overstaying ones welcome also significantly increase over time.What does all of this have to do with CSCO stock?7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowTo my eyes, shares of Cisco are now reaching a critical technical resistance area just as the broader stock market, too, looks to be at risk of a pause if not an outright mean-reversion move lower.CSCO Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that CSCO stock over the past few days has reached its reaction highs from the year 2007.Click to EnlargeAlso note that the stock is getting closer to reaching the upper end of the multi-year up-trending channel (marked by the purple-dotted parallels).While Cisco stock ultimately can and likely will overcome this technical area of confluence around the $34 area on a more sustainable basis, for the time being the stock likely needs to consolidate before taking this next leg higher.On the daily chart, we see that CSCO as a result of the latest two-week breakout rally has reached a notable overbought reading in its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at the bottom of the chart.Click to EnlargeLast time Cisco's RSI reached such overbought readings it was late 2014 and the stock promptly corrected 6% over the course of a couple of weeks.Weibo Corp (ADR) (WB) Stock Goes Cold Despite Hot Q4 EarningsFrom here, while CSCO stock in and of itself has yet to flag a bearish reversal, any break back below $33.60 could be an initial warning sign. Moreover, it could be opportunity to trade the stock for a mean-reversion move lower toward the $32 to $32.50 area.Like what you see?

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) Stock Is CRAZY Cheap;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) desperately needed some good news heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. TEVA stock hit its lowest level in over a decade the week before, after its CEO resigned abruptly.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler (Modified)The departure of CEO Erez Vigodman came amidst reports of bribery investigations in the company's home country of Israel. And it came after a long decline in TEVA stock, driven by pricing pressure, questionable acquisitions, and a ""patent cliff"" for Teva Pharmaceutical's key drug, Copaxone.And while Q4 earnings delivered, the news wasn't great. Revenue increased 33%, but that came almost solely from the acquisition ofAllergan plc's(NYSE:AGN) generics business. Teva Pharmaceutical paid $40.5 billion in a transaction that has boosted sales as well as Teva's debt load. Margins were pressured, reflected in non-GAAP EPS that increased just 8% despite the 33% rise in sales.But the company also reaffirmed 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.90-$5.30. That eased fears of another reduction in the 2017 outlook, which had been cut in January from $6-$6.50. The news was enough to drive a ""relief rally"" in TEVA stock, which now has climbed more than 10% from its lows.There should be more upside ahead, even if the road might be bumpy. Teva does have numerous risks, both near-term and long-term. But it also has tremendous potential, a cheap multiple, and a new CEO on the way. There's a turnaround opportunity in TEVA stock and it doesn't look quite priced in.Why It's Crazy to Buy Teva StockAdmittedly, there are concerns across the board for Teva stock. Thepatent invalidationfor Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis treatment, puts an estimated 20% of revenue, and possibly 40%-plus of profit, at risk. On the Q4 call, CFO Eyal Desheh estimated an $800 million cash flow impact in 2017, should competition enter immediately.That entrance - which would occur if Teva loses its appeal - also would shave 75 to 95 cents off EPS.The combination of lower earnings and higher debt after the Allergan deal raises another risk. Teva's leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) at the end of 2016 was 4.7. That doesn't imply immediate risk of bankruptcy, to be sure. But Teva bonds that mature in 2026 have fallen about 12% just since September. Clearly, the debt markets are pricing in a greater, if still modest, possibility of a restructuring that could wipe out TEVA stock.The company now faces the challenge of finding a new CEO.Both previous CEOsleft relatively quickly, amid questions of fit within Teva's culture and clashes with the company's board. The company's current bylaws require the CEO to reside in Israel, though it's possible those could be changed for the next candidate.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The bear case for TEVA stock is that, yes, it is cheap - and for good reason. Declining profits, a $36 billion debt load, concerns about generic pricing, and the loss of Copaxone all present significant risks. And those risks justify a 7x multiple to the midpoint of 2017 EPS guidance.Why Teva Stock Is a Buy NonethelessThose concerns are valid. But they're also backward-looking.Teva has numerous options to improve its situation, and interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said on the Q4 call that Teva would ""leave no stone unturned"" in considering those options.And what's important to keep in mind is that the situation isn't all that dire. Yes, bonds have fallen; but the yield to maturity still is just 4.4%, implying a very low chance of bankruptcy over the next decade. The leverage ratio could move above 5x if Copaxone competition moves in; but that remains a manageable level. This isn'tValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX); Teva's back isn't against the wall.The company has options. TEVA is targeting a 3.5x leverage ratio, and likely will consider asset sales as a path to those levels. There's still the possibility of a split between the branded and generic businesses, something Wall Street has long targeted. (That decision appears up to the new CEO, per the Q4 call.)Copaxone sales and profits aren't going to zero, even if generic competition enters immediately. And the same goes for Teva Pharmaceutical earnings. This remains the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world based on revenue. With rising health care costs a concern pretty much everywhere, and drug pricing a key part of those concerns, that's a major long-term competitive advantage for Teva.The Apple iPhone 8 Will Be Revolutionary (AAPL)And TEVA stock is cheap - even assuming the worst about Copaxone. Using the low end of 2017 guidance and the high end of the guided Copaxone impact still puts 2017 EPS near $4, and TEVA stock's P/E multiple below 10. Simply stabilizing the business at those levels likely implies a 12-13 multiple - and gets TEVA stock to $50.It's always difficult to time the bottom in any stock. But the Q4 earnings from Teva Pharmaceutical seem to imply that the company at least has a handle on its challenges. Looking forward, the debt load isn't so big that the company is forced to do anything, and a new CEO will bring fresh eyes.There are concerns, to be sure. But Teva Pharmaceutical has a lot of tools still at its disposal to answer those concerns, and push TEVA stock higher.The author has no position in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialWatch Cisco Systems, Inc.

1 Number Cisco Wants Investors to Focus On;2/21/2017;"The headline numbers fromCisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) fiscal second-quarter report were far from   impressive. Revenue slumped by 2% year over year, driven by   weakness in the core switching and routing segments. Non-GAAP EPS   was flat, aided by share buybacks.There were some bright spots. The security business expanded   by 14%, continuing its impressive streak of growth. And the   collaboration business returned to growth after a disappointing   first quarter. But data center, another growth business, suffered   a decline in revenue, and weakness in the core businesses   overwhelmed any pockets of strength.Image source: Cisco Systems.makeArticleAd();Cisco has been shifting toward a recurring-revenue business   model, embracing subscription software and services as it aims to   lower its dependence on hardware sales. This shift is hurting the   company's results, knocking at least 2 percentage points off   revenue growth, according to CFO Kelly Kramer.The good news for Cisco investors is that progress is clearly   being made. Deferred revenue, particularly deferred revenue   related to subscriptions, is soaring. With a weak top line,   that's the number that Cisco wants investors to focus on.   However, investors shouldn't ignore the price tag associated with   the acquisitions that are helping to drive that growth.$17.1 billion and countingDeferred revenue is booked as a liability on the balance sheet   when a company receives payment for a product or service which it   has yet to deliver. In the case of a subscription, this deferred   revenue is transformed into real revenue over the length of the   contract. Subscription businesses that take payment upfront for   software or services that will be delivered over time often use   deferred revenue growth as a proxy for future revenue growth.   It'sfar from a perfect measure, but it gives investors a rough way to judge a subscription   company's performance.Cisco's total deferred revenue reached $17.1 billion at the   end of the second quarter, up 13% year over year. Deferred   revenue related to services grew 9% year over year to $10.5   billion, while product deferred revenue jumped 19% to $6.6   billion. The rapid growth of the product deferred revenue was   mostly due to a surge in software and subscriptions.Deferred revenue from software and subscriptions was up 51%   year over year at the end of the second quarter, reaching $4   billion. This explosive growth has yet to drive meaningful   revenue growth for the company overall, but the numbers are   starting to get big. Roughly two-thirds of this growth can be   attributed to the security, collaboration, and wireless   businesses, with the rest coming from Cisco's larger   segments.Even growing by 51%, $4 billion of subscription deferred   revenue doesn't yet mean much for a company that does nearly $50   billion in revenue each year. Cisco remains highly dependent on   hardware sales, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. But   if the company can continue growing its subscription businesses   at a rapid pace, revenue should eventually start consistently   growing once again.Driving growth with acquisitionsOne pillar of Cisco's growth strategy is acquisitions. The   company has made plenty of software acquisitions in recent years,   adding to its security, collaboration, and Internet of Things   portfolio. But thedeal announced in January to acquire   AppDynamicsrepresents an escalation. Cisco agreed to pay $3.7 billion   for the application monitoring company, a staggering 16 times   sales.The deal makes strategic sense, and it will help Cisco further   fill out its software business. But the price tag suggest that   Cisco is putting growth ahead of discipline. Cisco has tens of   billions of dollars of excess cash earning next to nothing, but   dramatically overpaying for start-ups is a good way to waste   it.More software acquisitions are likely, especially if Cisco is   able to repatriate some of its foreign cash at favorable rates in   the near future. Additional deals will help turbocharge the   company's shift to software and subscriptions, but investors   should be concerned about the company's newfound willingness to   pay excessive premiums.The rapid growth of Cisco's deferred revenue is an encouraging   sign that the company's shift to subscriptions and software is   making progress and will eventually pay off. But acquisitions are   driving a portion of that growth, and Cisco is paying a high   price for AppDynamics to keep the ball rolling.As a Cisco investor, I have mixed feelings about all of this.   The push toward subscriptions and software is the right move, but   the price tag for AppDynamics, which Cisco plucked right before   its planned IPO, is troubling. I'm hoping that the company will   be a little less eager to close deals in the future.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things""";2/21/2017;"All around us, the world grows more intertwined every day. Thanks in part to our global web connections, we have the ability to interact with people and things on an incredible level. This online experience can be life-saving and important, or it can be as arbitrary as simplifying monotonous tasks.There are many industries and companies that aim to advance this experience. One growing market, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), connects our household or commercial items to a wireless network by embedding them with electronic, software, or sensor technology. This network of devices allows us to take the next step into a wireless world that relies less and less on direct human-to-computer interaction.You might actually be using products in the IoT without knowing it. Some common examples include the remote operation of a house's security system, wearable motion and activity tacking products, and even public trash bins that automatically alert a municipality when it is full.The Internet of Things is definitely present in our everyday lives right now, but it also has a lot more room to grow. According to research firm IDC, via theWall Street Journal, the IoT market could nearly triple in the coming years. In 2014, the global IoT market was worth $655.8 billion, but it could reach up to $1.7 trillion by the year 2020.With the industry showing that much room for growth, investors need to start thinking about investing in the IoT now, and we've highlighted a few companies and strategies for those who would like get the IoT into their portfolios.ETF SuccessPerhaps the easiest way for investors to make a play on the Internet of Things is with a themed ETF. If that interests you, check out Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETFSNSR, the first IoT-related ETF on the market.Big Name Patent HoldersOne of the most important steps a company needs to take to capitalize on emerging technology is locking down patents at the earliest possible point. In regards to the Internet of Things market, we've seen a lot of companies filing for patents that put them in a good position to grow as the IoT grows.One such company is technology behemoth AppleAAPL. Apple holds a patent named ""Local Device Awareness"", which describes an automated relationship between multiple close-range devices. The technology could be used for position tracking, such as finding a lost remote control, or even proximity-based virtual reality, like a video game that depends on one's actual position in a room.Another major IoT patent holder is IBMIBM. Primarily an information technology-focused company, IBM figures to be a major player in the IoT. Currently, IBM holds a patent regarding data filtering in Internet of Things devices, which describes a process in which devices receive and interpret information. This patent puts IBM amongst the frontrunners in technology that allows devices to communicate without human interaction.Furthermore, IBM just announced an Internet of Things partnership with Cisco SystemsCSCO. IBM will implement its Watson technology into Cisco's wide network of edge devices and end points in an effort to provide real-time feedback and data for the oil & gas, manufacturing, shipping, and mining industries.Today's Leading ProductsWhile patents are important for future growth and development, we also have to look at the already-available IoT devices. Again, we are looking at some of the world's biggest tech companies here.One of the more obvious industry leaders is Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand its line of Nest home monitoring products. Alphabet, under the Google name at the time, acquired Nest for $3.2 billion in early 2014, and since then the brand has become one of the biggest names in home automation with its smart thermostats, smoke detectors, and safety cameras.Another leader in the IoT market right now is AmazonAMZN. Amazon's Dash Buttons, which allow users to re-order specific products with the click of an actual physical button that can be placed anywhere in the home, could be considered an entry-level IoT device. Additionally, the company's Echo smart speakers, which utilize its Alexa home connectivity technology, are probably the most popular consumer IoT product on the market right nowGoogle actually recently responded to Amazon's Echo speaker with a home automation device of its own, the Google Home. The Home runs on Google's new voice assistant, which also powers its new Pixel phone and represents Google's new era of hardware/software interaction.(Also read:Google's New ""Home"" Internet of Things Device   Challenges Amazon Echo)Finally, SamsungSSNLFis another major player with its SmartThings brand. Samsung SmartThings are a series of in-home products, ranging from electric outlets to motion sensors, which allow for easier control of a users' entire home.Unsung HeroesThe technology giants will certainly be leaders in the IoT market, but investors should also look into the smaller companies that will be the manufacturers of the actual hardware. For every product IoT product sold by Apple, the supplier who built one of the components within the device also stands to benefit.One of Apple's key suppliers is Skyworks SolutionsSWKS. Skyworks is the industry leader in semiconductor manufacturing and currently produces a chip that is a vital part of the iPhone. Similar technology will be the backbone of the IoT movement, as semiconductors and sensors move beyond their usual homes in phones and computers and into our other household items. Skyworks is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors should also focus on some smaller cap stocks that have potential to grow in correlation with the IoT market. One such company would be Sierra WirelessSWIR, a wireless communications expert with a product line that should fit perfectly in the IoT market. Sierra is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another company to consider is Iridium CommunicationsIRDM, a low-Earth orbit satellite company that has recently partnered with IoT platform providers as the industry has discovered a use for LEOs in connecting the world. IRDM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bottom LineThe Internet of Things has the potential to change the consumer electronics industry as we know it. The growth of the market will be another indication of humanity's expansion into an autonomous world, and investors need to start taking note of the IoT now.Whether you want to focus on the major technology players or the small companies at the heart of the IoT movement, the time is now to add this industry to your portfolio.Also, investors interested in the Internet of Things should check out this episode of theZacks Friday Finish Linepodcast:Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Can Amazon's Chime Challenge Microsoft's Skype and Cisco's Spark?;2/21/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently introduced Chime, an  enterprise   collaboration service for online meetings, video conferencing,   voice calls, chat, and content sharing. Chime's apps work on iOS,   Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchronized across   all platforms via Amazon Web Services (AWS).Chime comes in three versions -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voice   and video calls and chat; Chime Plus, which adds screen sharing   and the integration of company directories; and Chime Pro, which   adds tools for scheduling, hosting, recording, and personalizing   meetings for up to 100 people.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();These features indicate that Amazon is taking aim at   collaborative tools likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rivals already too deeply   entrenched in the enterprise market for Amazon to disrupt? Let's   take a closer look at Amazon's game plan to find out.Entering the crowded SaaS marketAmazon's AWS, which has an annual run rate of $14 billion, is   the  biggest cloud infrastructure platform in the world.   It's several times larger than its closest competitor,   Microsoft's Azure. But while AWS dominates the cloud platform   (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which hosts   storage space, processing power, and other tools for companies   and developers -- it doesn't have a major presence in the SaaS   (software as a service) market yet.The SaaS market is the crowded, consumer-facing side of the   cloud, which includes services like Microsoft's Office 365,   Dynamics CRM, and Skype. The lion's share of Microsoft's   commercialized cloud revenue run  rate of $14 billion is   generated by those SaaS products instead of Azure. Microsoft has   also been expanding Skype's capabilities as an enterprise   collaboration tool with  Microsoft Teams, which enhances   Skype's cloud-based communication features and tightly integrates   the service into Office 365.Microsoft Teams. Image source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, networking giant Cisco aggressively bundles   software and security products with its routers, switches, and   unified computing systems. Those bundles include collaboration   tools like Spark, the cloud-based platform for  messages,   meetings, and calls it launched in late 2015. Last quarter,   Cisco's collaboration revenues rose 4% annually to $1.06 billion   -- making it its third largest business after its  core   businesses of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the only players in the crowded   field of cloud-based collaborative tools.Alphabet's Google has been promoting Hangouts to enterprise customers   over  the past year,Boxhas added collaborative tools on top of its cloud storage   platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix's GoToMeeting video conferencing platform for the same purposes.   However, all these challengers notably lack Microsoft and Cisco's   clout in the enterprise market.That's why Amazon believes it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also has leverage -- the   growing importance of AWS to enterprise customers. Amazon likely   believes that by offering Chime as an extension of AWS   (especially with its 30-day free trial) to its enterprise   customer base, it can gain a foothold in the crowded ""unified   communication"" platform market.Amazon previously launched enterprise SaaS products like    WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever   released official growth figures for those products. However,   most industry watchers believe that those products are still   dwarfed by comparable solutions from Microsoft and Cisco. This   strongly indicates that AWS' dominance of the PaaS/IaaS markets   doesn't guarantee that Chime will become a Skype or Spark killer   anytime soon. Chime Pro also  costs more than Skype for   Business -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plans to undercut its   way into the market.The key takeawayChime sounds like a logical way for AWS to straddle the   PaaS/IaaS and SaaS markets, but it's easier said than done. The   market for cloud-based unified communication platforms is   incredibly crowded, and it's doubtful that a new service -- even   one bundled with AWS -- can claim a meaningful slice of the   market. However, Amazon investors should still keep an eye out   for future SaaS products to see if the company can eventually   challenge heavyweights like Microsoft and Cisco.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Cisco, FireEye, Barracuda, NetApp and Ixia;2/21/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 21, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeCisco(NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report),FireEye(NASDAQ:FEYE-Free Report),Barracuda Networks(NYSE:CUDA-Free Report),NetApp(NASDAQ:NTAP-Free Report) andIxia(NASDAQ:XXIA-Free Report)Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Why Cisco Is Increasing Focus on CybersecuritySince Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report) provides high-end hardware that connects computing devices at both the edge and core of the network, it can add value to its offerings by making the network more secure.What's Going for the Market Right NowWith Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuing to grow and enterprises increasingly adopting policies like bring-your-own device (BYOD), the number of network end-points is increasing rapidly. On the other side, the concept of shared resources in the cloud to be accessed by these devices has greatly increased the need for adequate security at the core.The changing work environment has greatly increased data flow between devices and the cloud and between each other. The advent of autonomous cars will increase these data flows exponentially, as each car will generate a huge amount of data.Data is extremely important these days because when analyzed, it can help businesses make better-informed decisions. So securing the data is in the interest of individuals on account of privacy concerns, corporations on business considerations and the government on intelligence considerations.President Obama recently increased the budget for cybersecurity. But with President Trump taking office last month, cybersecurity is expected to become an area of even greater focus. The draft cybersecurity order, which he has yet to sign, seeks to overhaul a policy under which each government agency was responsible for its own networks.The responsibility for hacks will now be placed on the White House's Budget and Management Office after a comprehensive review of the most critical hacking vulnerabilities in military, intelligence and civilian government computer systems is completed within 60 days of the day the order is signed. What's more, the Commerce Secretary will do the necessary to push the private sector to increase ""investments in cybersecurity tools, services and software.""Cybersecurity Ventures reportedly estimates that the global cybersecurity space will grow at a CAGR of 9.8% from around $106.3 billion in 2015 to around $170.2 billion by 2020. Approximately $1 trillion is expected to be spent globally on cybersecurity from 2017 to 2021.IDC estimates that worldwide businesses will spend $101.6 billion on cybersecurity in 2020, a 38% increase from the estimated $73.7 billion spend in 2016 with the banking sector spending the most. Geographically, the U.S. will lead with $31.5 billion on cybersecurity tools and services and Western Europe will be second with $19.5 billion.The Asia/Pacific region, while still a smaller contributor, will grow the fastest in spending by 2020. (India will be one of the fastest-growing countries, with the Data Security Council of India [DSCI] estimating that the market will grow from $4 billion in 2015 to $35 billion in 2025.) Middle East, Africa and Western Europe will follow Asia.As a result of the solid prospects, venture funding for security startups is on the rise. CB Insights estimates that VC firms invested $3.1 billion in a record 279 cybersecurity startups in 2016.The Cisco SolutionBeing the dominant provider of high-end networking gear, Cisco has been under pressure to make some big changes. The most important factors driving these changes are increased competition from smaller companies offering traditional products and a fresh challenge from companies selling industry standard hardware coupled with sophisticated software (software-defined networking, or SDN).Cisco has the resources to expand into adjacencies, and it has had mixed success with these initiatives. One area that has paid dividends and is likely to continue to do so is security.Cisco has taken a largely acquisitive route to building its security business. In 2013, it acquired Sourcefire (its largest acquisition in the space) for $2.7 billion, as well as a smaller company called Cognitive Security. ThreatGRID and Neophasis were added in 2014. A couple of larger acquisitions followed in 2015 (OpenDNS for $635 million and Lancope for $453 million). In 2016, Cisco acquired CloudLock for nearly $300 million.All these acquisitions have increased Cisco's strength in the category, enabling it to announce new products and strategies. The most recent product launch was that of Umbrella, its first Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) in the cloud. Umbrella is a way to secure end points that may be mobile or geographically spread out when not connected through a VPN.Given the weak outlook announced on its recent earnings call, Cisco shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). But there are many other buy-ranked technology companies to choose from: FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE-Free Report), Barracuda Networks (NYSE:CUDA-Free Report), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP-Free Report), Ixia (NASDAQ:XXIA-Free Report), etc. Or, seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

2 Top Internet-of-Things Stocks to Buy Now;2/18/2017;"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a $19 trillion   opportunity, according to formerCisco SystemsCEO John Chambers. That figure may be overstating it, but the IoT   does present one of the most significant investment opportunities   of our times.One of the best ways to invest in broad-based movements such   as the IoT is by buying shares in the companies that supply the   hardware and infrastructure powering the trend -- such asSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andNXP Semiconductor(NASDAQ: NXPI) . Let's dig into each company to see what makes   them two of the top IoT investments on the market today.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Skyworks SolutionsThough it manufactures about 2,500 kinds of   chips, Skyworks Solutions mostly touches on a single theme   with its products: making complex connectivity tasks simple. For   example, Skyworks' chips power a number of mission-critical tasks   inApple's iPhones, such as solving connection interference problems,   increasing data transfer speeds, and saving battery   power. The company's unique ability to offer turnkey   solutions for important tasks like this has made it a go-to   supplier for mobile devices, a trend that will only grow with the   continued rise of the IoT.Skyworks' compelling value proposition continues to reveal   itself in its quarterly results. In its most recent quarter,   Skyworks increased sales 9% sequentially to $914 million, which   also helped the company establish a new record for quarterly free   cash flow and net income. The company's financial   performance stands a strong chance of accelerating later this   year, thanks to the anticipated debut of Apple's redesigned   iPhone; the Mac maker accounts for 40% of Skyworks' sales via its   contract manufacturing partner,Foxconn. Overall, the company should be able to maintain its   above-average earnings growth for years to come. The analyst   community estimates that Skyworks will grow its EPS at an average   annual rate of 14.7% over the next five years.Trading at 18 times its last 12 months'   earnings. Skyworks Solutions looks like an appealing way to   play the rise of the IoT.NXP SemiconductorDutch IoT player NXP Semiconductor specializes in enabling   secure connections between devices, which makes the company a   candidate for strong growth as the number of devices that ""talk""   with one another increases in the years to come. The company   enjoys market leadership positions across a host of   connected-device applications, including automotive in-car   networking and near-field communication, to name just a   few. Its various leadership positions also provide NXP with   a strong margin profile, as seen in its 48% GAAP gross margin   last quarter. This situation allows NXP to reinvest in R&D,   which spurs further innovation and extends its market leadership   in a virtuous cycle that CEO Rick Clemmer and team have   implemented to great effect.However, for all of NXP's opportunity, investing in the   company also comes with some important risks. Last October, for   instance, it agreed to a buyout offer from chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) for $110 per share; its shares trade at $102 at   the time of this writing. Qualcomm's offer was an all-cash   deal, meaning that participating in NXP's continued growth will   require investors buy Qualcomm stock outright after the buyout   closes. But the outlook for Qualcomm's business -- aside from NXP   -- hasworsenedin the months since news of the NXP buyout broke.Qualcomm's patent licensing business, which produces the bulk   of the company's profit, has come under pressure in recent years,   as government regulators in China and the EU have accused the   company of charging excessive royalty rates to mobile-device   makers. This trend seems to have accelerated in recent months, as   regulators in South Korea and the U.S. FTC have also sued   Qualcomm over charges of anticompetitive business practices.   Adding insult to injury, Qualcomm customer Apple sued the   company in January over its patent licensing practices.Qualcomm plans to defend itself to the hilt and has presented   compelling counterarguments to some of the accusations. However,   given the weight of its current legal entanglements, Qualcomm   seems risky as an investment, even despite the long-term benefit   the NXP Semiconductor buyout is likely to add.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Cloud Stocks That Doubled in a Year;2/17/2017;"Over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 rallied 25% and the   NASDAQ climbed 33%. Those gains -- which propelled both indexes   to record highs -- are impressive, but a few other stocks crushed   even those returns with triple-digit gains.Three such stocks --Veeva Systems(NYSE: VEEV) ,Paycom Software(NYSE: PAYC) , andProofpoint(NASDAQ: PFPT) -- all develop cloud-based software. Let's take a   look at why these three cloud stocks surged, and whether   investors should consider buying them this year.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Veeva SystemsVeeva Systems provides a cloud-based CRM (customer   relationship management) platform for healthcare companies. It   usesSalesforce's SFA (Sales Force Automation) tools as the foundation of its   CRM platform for drug companies. Its core products include the   Veeva Vault, which tracks prescribing habits, clinical trials,   regulatory filings, and industry regulations; and the Veeva   Commercial Cloud, which helps companies manage customer   relationships.Shares of Veeva have soared more than 110% over the past year,   fueled by four straight quarters of 30%+ annual sales growth and   rising profitability. Veeva's revenue rose 34% annually to $142.8   million last quarter, and its non-GAAP earnings surged 83% to   $0.22 per share. GAAP earnings more than doubled to $0.15 per   share.Veeva attributes all that growth to the growth of new cloud   services and new companies signing up for its Commercial Cloud.   Intense competition between drugmakers and new regulatory   pressures have also sparked fierce demand for Veeva's   industry-tracking services. For fiscal 2017 (which ended on Jan.   31), Veeva expects its revenue and non-GAAP earnings to   respectively grow 32% and 79%. For fiscal 2018, analysts expect   Veeva's revenue to rise 21%, and for its earnings to grow another   18%.Paycom SoftwarePaycom Software provides cloud-based tools for payroll   processing and human resources. It runs five main businesses --   Talent Acquisition tools for streamlining the recruiting process,   Time and Labor Management tools for managing employee work   schedules, Payroll tools for automated payments, Talent   Management tools for monitoring performance and setting employee   goals, and HR Management tools for organizing virtual   documents.Paycom stock has surged more than 110% over the past 12   months. Its revenue growth rate has remained well above 30% ever   since its IPO in 2014, and its profitability has gradually   improved. Last quarter, its revenue rose  35% annually to   $87.8 million, and its non-GAAP earnings grew 80% to $0.18 per   share. Its GAAP earnings rose 67% to $0.15 per share, and its   adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $20.7 million.Paycom attributed that growth to its higher brand visibility,   expansion into new cities, new client wins, and market share   gains. For fiscal 2017 (which started on Jan. 1), Paycom expects   its revenue to rise 29% and for its  adjusted EBITDA to grow   about 20%.ProofpointProofpoint is a cloud-based security-as-a-service provider   that serves medium and large enterprises around the world. Its   platform includes a suite of threat protection, incident   response, regulator compliance, email archiving, electronic   discovery, and secure communication tools.Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Proofpoint more than doubled over the past 12   months, thanks to its robust earnings growth and improving   non-GAAP profitability. Its revenue has risen more than 40%   annually over the past three quarters -- which CEO Gary Steele   attributed to  ""robust demand for advanced threat solutions,   high competitive win rates, traction with new products, robust   add-on activity, and consistently high renewal rates.""Like many of its cybersecurity peers, Proofpoint has great top   line numbers but wobbly bottom line ones. Revenue rose  43%   annually to $106.8 million last quarter, and billings grew 42% to   $138.4 million; but GAAP net loss only narrowed slightly from   $27.4 million in the year-ago quarter to $22.9 million. But on a   non-GAAP basis, it reported a net profit of $8.5 million,   compared to a loss of $0.4 million a year ago.Proofpoint faces fierce competition from rival cloud security   players likeFireEyeand bigger bundled players likeCisco, but it remains confident in its growth prospects. For fiscal   2017 (which started on Jan. 1), it expects revenue to grow 30%   and non-GAAP earnings to improve 36%.But mind those valuationsVeeva, Paycom, and Proofpoint all boast impressive revenue   growth, but their valuations have also been inflated by their   year-long rallies. Veeva trades at nearly 100 times earnings and   Paycom has a P/E of 77 -- which are both much higher than the   industry average of 54 for application software companies.Proofpoint has a negative P/E due to its uneven profitability,   but it trades at 90 times forward earnings and 10 times sales --   which is double the industry average P/S ratio of 5 for software   companies. Therefore, investors interested in these three hot   stocks should do some more homework to see if their future growth   potential can be justified by these lofty valuations.10 stocks we like better than ProofpointWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Cisco (CSCO) Is Increasing Focus on Cybersecurity;2/17/2017;"Since CiscoCSCOprovides high-end hardware that connects computing devices at both the edge and core of the network, it can add value to its offerings by making the network more secure.What's Going for the Market Right NowWith Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuing to grow and enterprises increasingly adopting policies like bring-your-own device (BYOD), the number of network end-points is increasing rapidly. On the other side, the concept of shared resources in the cloud to be accessed by these devices has greatly increased the need for adequate security at the core.The changing work environment has greatly increased data flow between devices and the cloud and between each other. The advent of autonomous cars will increase these data flows exponentially, as each car will generate a huge amount of data.Data is extremely important these days because when analyzed, it can help businesses make better-informed decisions. So securing the data is in the interest of individuals on account of privacy concerns, corporations on business considerations and the government on intelligence considerations.President Obama recently increased the budget for cybersecurity. But with President Trump taking office last month, cybersecurity is expected to become an area of even greater focus. The draft cybersecurity order, which he has yet to sign, seeks to overhaul a policy under which each government agency was responsible for its own networks.The responsibility for hacks will now be placed on the White House's Budget and Management Office after a comprehensive review of the most critical hacking vulnerabilities in military, intelligence and civilian government computer systems is completed within 60 days of the day the order is signed. What's more, the Commerce Secretary will do the necessary to push the private sector to increase ""investments in cybersecurity tools, services and software.""Cybersecurity Ventures reportedly estimates that the global cybersecurity space will grow at a CAGR of 9.8% from around $106.3 billion in 2015 to around $170.2 billion by 2020. Approximately $1 trillion is expected to be spent globally on cybersecurity from 2017 to 2021.IDC estimates that worldwide businesses will spend $101.6 billion on cybersecurity in 2020, a 38% increase from the estimated $73.7 billion spend in 2016 with the banking sector spending the most. Geographically, the U.S. will lead with $31.5 billion on cybersecurity tools and services and Western Europe will be second with $19.5 billion.The Asia/Pacific region, while still a smaller contributor, will grow the fastest in spending by 2020. (India will be one of the fastest-growing countries, with the Data Security Council of India [DSCI] estimating that the market will grow from $4 billion in 2015 to $35 billion in 2025.) Middle East, Africa and Western Europe will follow Asia.As a result of the solid prospects, venture funding for security startups is on the rise. CB Insights estimates that VC firms invested $3.1 billion in a record 279 cybersecurity startups in 2016.The Cisco SolutionBeing the dominant provider of high-end networking gear, Cisco has been under pressure to make some big changes. The most important factors driving these changes are increased competition from smaller companies offering traditional products and a fresh challenge from companies selling industry standard hardware coupled with sophisticated software (software-defined networking, or SDN).Cisco has the resources to expand into adjacencies, and it has had mixed success with these initiatives. One area that has paid dividends and is likely to continue to do so is security as seen in the table below:Cisco Security Revenue Growth TrajectoryCisco has taken a largely acquisitive route to building its security business. In 2013, it acquired Sourcefire (its largest acquisition in the space) for $2.7 billion, as well as a smaller company called Cognitive Security. ThreatGRID and Neophasis were added in 2014. A couple of larger acquisitions followed in 2015 (OpenDNS for $635 million and Lancope for $453 million). In 2016, Cisco acquired CloudLock for nearly $300 million.All these acquisitions have increased Cisco's strength in the category, enabling it to announce new products and strategies. The most recent product launch was that of Umbrella, its first Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) in the cloud. Umbrella is a way to secure end points that may be mobile or geographically spread out when not connected through a VPN.Given the weak outlook announced on its recent earnings call, Cisco shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). But there are many other buy-ranked technology companies to choose from: FireEyeFEYE, Barracuda NetworksCUDA, NetAppNTAP, IxiaXXIA, etc. Or, seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

This announcement was the primary trigger for the day's losses.Of the three benchmarks, only the Dow closed less than 0.1% higher over the day. The blue-chip index was aided by a 1.9% gain from The Coca-Cola Company (KO). However, the major catalyst for the Dow's marginal gain was Cisco Systems Inc.

Cisco Systems Reaches Analyst Target Price;2/17/2017;"In recent trading, shares of Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $32.89, changing hands for $33.60/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.makeArticleAd();There are 19 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cisco Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $22.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $40.00. The standard deviation is $3.97.But the whole reason to look at theaverageCSCO price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CSCO crossing above that average target price of $32.89/share, investors in CSCO have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $32.89 just one stop on the way to an evenhighertarget, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

IBM And Visa To Monetize Internet Of Things (IoT) Devices;2/17/2017;"The world around us is moving towards pervasive connectivity, and as a result, any connected device can be a potential Point of Sale (PoS). This is exactly what the new initiative by IBM and Visa intends to accomplish, by combining “the business of the Internet of Things with the technology of the Internet of Things.” As IBM and Visa look to monetize Internet of Things (IoT) devices, here’s how they could benefit from the collaboration while driving the IoT technology closer to customer use for conducting commerce.""Worldwide spending on the Internet of Things (IoT) is forecast to reach $1.29 trillion in 2020,” according to IDCestimates. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), an active participant in the IoT business,estimatesthat “Internet of Everything (IoE) creates $14.4 trillion in Value at Stake -- the combination of increased revenues and lower costs that is created or will migrate among companies and industries from 2013 to 2022.”The figures above represent the huge potential that the Internet of Things offers and has led to companies as varied as industrial infrastructure, networking, enterprise systems, telecoms, and cloud computing, and more, to enter this space and offer IoT platforms in slight variations. AT&T, Cisco, Amazon, Ericsson, General Electric, Huawei, Salesforce.com, IBM and Vodafone are some of the major players in this area.makeArticleAd();Now, in a first of its kind ofcollaboration, IBM (IBM) and Visa (V) would enable quick and secure payment for businesses for any device connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled with Visa. With the multiple opportunities that the collaboration will enable, IBM takes a big leap in its IoT platform offering.“This combination of IBM’s industry leading IoT technologies with Visa payment services, signifies the next defining moment in commerce by allowing payments on any connected object, with new levels of simplicity and convenience for everyone”saidHarriet Green, general manager, IBM Watson IoT.“With the power of Watson’s cognitive technologies and IBM’s leadership in IoT and security, they are the ideal partner to help us deliver secure payments to ‘virtually anywhere' and on the enormous scale of the IoT,”saidJim McCarthy, executive vice president, innovation and strategic partnerships, Visa.The partnership combines IBM’s Watson IoT platform with Visa’s tokenization technology (that replaces the number of a card with a digital token) which would allow businesses to infuse secure payments using Visa Token Service across their product lines using IBM’s Watson IoT platform via IBM Cloud.There are multiple estimates related to the number of connected devices; Ericssonforecastsa total of 28 billion connected devices by 2021, Gartner’sestimateis at 20.8 billion by 2020 while IHSpredictsthe IoT market grow to 30.7 billion devices in 2020 and 75.4 billion in 2025. Overall, with the huge projected number of connected devices, Visa and IBM would be instrumental in supporting business and payment transactions on billions of commerce-based IoT such as connected cars, wearables, clothing and home appliances.The partnership opens an interface between Visa’s 3 billion consumers globally and IBM’s Watson IoT Platform which is used by more than 6,000 clients, who are further helping customers connect to millions of devices. Visa dominated 70.3% of the debit card and 47.4% of the credit card market in the U.S. (based on purchase volume in 2015). Its closest competitor MasterCard Incorporation (MA) is also eyeing IoT.  In October, General Motors and IBMannouncedthe auto industry’s first cognitive mobility platform – OnStar Go – backed by MasterCard for payments.Final WordThe collaboration between IBM and Visa won't just push monetization of IoT devices, it will also enable customized commerce experiences by making recommendations based on the need, usage and reference pattern of customers. If such advanced mechanisms are coupled with adequate cybersecurity protections, businesses and individuals will have unique payment experiences in the times to come. The whole ecosystem of paying for anything will change dramatically and it won’t be long before your running shoes will tell you that it’s time for you to get a new pair."

However, this increase was partially offset by weak performance from Switching, NGN Routing, Data Center and Service Provider Video segments which decreased 5%, 10%, 4% and 41%, respectively.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas, EMEA and APJC declined 4%, 1% and 4%, respectively.

As percentage of revenues, Research and development (R&D) and General and Administrative (G&A) expenses increased 30 bps and 240 bps, respectively. However, Sales and Marketing (S&M) expense remained flat on a year-over-year basis.As a result, operating margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 20 bps to 28%.Cisco Systems Inc. - Earnings Surprise |     FindTheBestBalance Sheet and Cash FlowCisco exited the second quarter with cash and investments balance of almost $71.8 billion compared with $71 billion in the prior quarter. Cash & cash equivalents and investments available in the U.S. at the end of quarter were $9.6 billion.Total debt (short term and long term) was $34.9 billion, slightly up from $34.8 billion at the end of previous quarter.Cisco raised quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 29 cents per share, to be paid on Apr 26, 2017. The company repurchased approximately 33 million shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program at an average price of $30.33 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion.As of Jan 28, 2017, Cisco had repurchased 4.7 billion shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $98.6 billion since the inception of the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount under this program is approximately $13.4 billion.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to decline in the range of 2% or remain flat on a year-over-year basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 53 cents on revenue estimates of $11.87 billion.Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 63-64%, while operating margin is anticipated between 29% and 30% for the quarter.Our TakeWe believe that Cisco's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market are promising. The company's security solutions continue to add customers, which is positive in our view.Although the transition from blade to rack server continues to hurt Data Center revenues, the collaboration with Microsoft'sMSFTAzure is expected to drive growth going ahead. Further, the acquisition of AppDynamics is also positive in our view.Additionally, the company's partnerships with the likes of salesforce.comCRMand International Business MachinesIBMwill help it to gain significant traction in the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) market space in the long run.Moreover, continued share buyback and dividend hikes are positive in our view.We note that Cisco has outperformed the ZacksComputer Networksindustry in the last one year. While the stock gained 24.0%, the industry witnessed an increase of 23.2%. We expect the aforesaid factors to drive upside going forward.However, the modest second-quarter results reflected intensifying competition from several smaller players in the networking segments, slowing order growth from service providers and challenges in the emerging markets. We believe that third-quarter revenue guidance continues to reflect these growing headwinds.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

The miner unveiled earnings of $425 million, or 36 cents per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, earnings came in at 22 cents per share.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeWall Street was calling for adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share. The earnings beat also came in ahead of the eight cents per share Barrick Gold posted in the fourth quarter of 2015.Part of the company's success over the period can be attributed to lower production costs, as well as higher gold and copper prices that gave the industry a welcome boost.For 2017, Barrick Gold hopes to improve its free cash flow per share. Gold production in the current year will come at a higher amount than expected as it will produce between 5.6 million and 5.9 million ounces, amounting to $750 and $790 per ounce.The company also announced a quarterly dividend that will amount to 3 cents per share, which is higher than the original 2 cents per share announced.ABX shares wafted up 2.1% in Thursday's premarket trading.Cisco Systems, Inc.

The company also raised its quarterly dividend to 29 cents per share, marking a 3-cent boost.The company unveiled a third-quarter revenue outlook that will see net sales decline as much as 2% year-over-year.

The travel review website revealed that it earned 16 cents per share on an adjusted basis, which was nearly half the 31 cents per share that analysts were expecting.Data compiled byThomson Reuterspredicted revenue of $326.5 million for TripAdvisor's fourth quarter, but the company missed this figure as it raked in $316 million.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Beats Estimates, Hikes DividendPart of the reason why the company suffered in its last three months of fiscal 2016 has to do with lower display advertisements on its websites, as well as a drop in subscription revenue. Revenue from display-based advertising and subscription slipped 2.8% to $69 million. TripAdvisor's other hotel revenue amounted to $29 million, which marked a 20.7% decline year-over-year.TRIP shares are down 6.3% in premarket trading.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or Selling7 Sports Stocks to Buy That Any Investor Can OwnThe post3 Stocks to Watch on Thursday: Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (ABX), Cisco Systems, Inc.

Cisco Boosts Dividend Amid Weak Switching and Routing Sales;2/16/2017;"Networking hardware giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal second-quarter results after   the market closed on Feb. 15. Revenue declined as the core   switching and routing businesses performed poorly, and growth   businesses such as collaboration and security were unable to   fully offset that weakness. An 11.5% dividend boost and guidance   that calls for a slightly better third quarter provided some good   news amid otherwise lackluster results.Cisco Systems results: The raw numbersMetricQ2 2017makeArticleAd();Q2 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$11.58 billion$11.93 billion(2.9%)Net income$2.35 billion$3.15 billion(25.4%)Non-GAAP EPS$0.57$0.570%Data source: Cisco Systems.Image source: Cisco Systems.What happened with Cisco Systems this quarter?Revenue slumped as both the switching and routing segments   posted weak numbers, but the bottom line held up on an adjusted   basis.Excluding the divestiture of the SP Video CPE business,     revenue declined by 2% year over year.Switching revenue dropped 5% to $3.31 billion, while     routing revenue tumbled 10% to $1.82 billion.Collaboration, Cisco's third largest segment, grew revenue     by 4% to $1.06 billion.Data center revenue declined by 4% to $790 million, while     wireless revenue rose 3% to $632 million.The security segment continued to be a standout performer,     growing revenue by 14% to $528 million.Total deferred revenue jumped 12.5% year over year to $17.1     billion, reflecting Cisco's ongoing shift toward subscription     software. Product-deferred revenue related to recurring     software and subscriptions surged 51% year over year.Cisco announced an 11.5% increase to its quarterly     dividend. The new dividend is $0.29 per share.Cisco agreed to acquire AppDynamics, a privately held     software company, on Jan. 24 for $3.7 billion.Cisco expects a smaller revenue decline during the third   quarter.Revenue is expected to be down 2% to flat year over year,     although the third quarter of 2016 had an extra week.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected between 63% and 64%, with     non-GAAP operating margin between 29% and 30%.Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $0.57 to     $0.59.What management had to sayCisco CEO Chuck Robbins talked up the company's acquisition of   AppDynamics:We are pleased with the quarter and the continued customer     momentum as we help them drive security, automation, and     intelligence across the network and into the cloud. This     quarter we announced our intent to acquire AppDynamics which,     combined with Cisco's networking analytics, will provide     customers with unprecedented insights into business     performance. We will remain focused on accelerating innovation     across our portfolio as we continue to deliver value to     customers and shareholders.CFO Kelly Kramer discussed the company's progress and its   dividend increase:We delivered a solid Q2 with $11.6 billion in revenues and     further growth in key business areas of collaboration, security     and services. I am pleased with our progress on business     transformation to software and recurring revenues. We expect to     continue to execute well and return value to our shareholders,     including, our board approved an increase of three cents to the     quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share.Looking forwardCisco's core switching and routing businesses were weak during   the third quarter, and the company's growth businesses were   unable to grow fast enough to pick up the slack. The shift to   subscription software continues to negatively affect Cisco's   results, with revenue being pushed out into the future. Net   income dropped considerably, but a one-time tax benefit during   the second quarter of last year was the culprit. On a non-GAAP   basis, the bottom line held up well.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Beats Estimates, Hikes Dividend;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) delivered GAAP earnings of $2.3 billion, 47 cents per share, on revenue of $11.6 billion.The revenue number was $200 million lower than last year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn a non-GAAP basis, however,the numbers were considered quite good.Adjusted income came in at 57 cents per share, and revenues beat estimates by $50 million.Despite the weakness on the top line the stock was rewarded, rising almost 1% in after-hours trading after advancing 1.6% during the Feb 15 trading day. It is expected to open Feb. 16 at about $33 per share.The reason is that the company announced it is raising its dividend to 29 cents per share from 26, and continuing to buy back shares so it can stay under 5.1 million shares outstanding, even while granting stock and stop options as part of its compensation.The Cloud ChallengeReporters were not amused on the company's conference call, asking tough question about data center revenues, the company's turn to computer security, and its relationships with top customers.Management said one of those top customers, unnamed, had a tough year while the other nine grew at double-digit rates, which is why overall revenues fell.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeOver the course of the past decade Cisco has increasingly emphasized relations with its biggest customers, becoming the primary supplier of gear to the world's largest telephone companies. But those companies are losing in the cloud to vendors likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which prefer to build their own hardware from parts, rather than buying high-end gear from outside vendors.Cisco is now seeking to transition toward software, adding talent in analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, said CEO Chuck Robbins. ""We're trying to take out the cost of running this infrastructure,"" he said, calling the software move ""broad-based.""Cisco said 31% of revenue is now subscription-based, rather than product revenue. It's a tough turn for any hardware company to make. ""We are trying to make that shift,"" said CFO Kelly Kramer, noting theCisco Onesecurity  offering. ""Six quarters ago, our recurring revenue was 26% of the total,"" added Robbins. ""In the last two quarters that change has accelerated. We are finding ways to move that forward.""Cisco plans to add new subscription services in analytics and automation over the next year. The hope is the software will be compelling enough to win business among companies that have stopped buying its hardware.Gross Margins WeakeningAnalysts were especially unhappy about a reduction in gross margins, which fell from 63.3% to 62.4% from the second quarter of 2016.""A year ago, we were benefitting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes and we were providing smart cards for secure access, with strong margins,"" explained Kramer. ""That program has slowed dramatically. On the hardware side, she added, ""We are also facing significantly higher memory costs, with dramatic increases.""Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Going to $30 This Year""Overall the teams did a great job,"" said Robbins, but Cisco looks doomed to remain a stock bought primarily for yield, making the dividend hike the big headline. The hike, if sustained over the next year, would take the company's dividend yield to 3.5%, based on the expected Feb 16 stock price.""We did deliver strong innovation, in our core portfolio,"" concluded Robbins. ""Our increased subscription revenue is evidence of our transition. We also remain committed to shareholder return,"" with increased buybacks and the dividend hike.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Tech Stock Roundup: INTC Analyst Day, AAPL Smartphone Lead;2/15/2017;"Intel Analyst DayIntel's analyst day was mostly about the growing importance of the data center business as a driver of both revenue growth and margin pressure. Within data center, the enterprise and government segment is expected to be the weakest due to delays related to the transition from on-premises to public cloud-based deployment, which is why it will grow a mere 2%.But this will be strongly supplemented with 15%+ growth in cloud service provider (helped by TAM expansion and higher prices) and 10%+ growth in communications service provider revenues. The much larger CPU portion will post a 6% CAGR dropping from 87% of revenue in 2017 to 75% in 2021. Non CPU parts of the data center business will record a 30% CAGR during the same time period.Intel put out some rather convincing charts showing the artificial intelligence opportunity and Intel's position within it along with its significance for total server revenue. Accordingly, in 2016, AI was just 7% of revenue, of which 60% was classic machine learning with the remainder being deep learning.In 2010, when NVIDIANVDAentered the market, Intel HPC accounted for 93% of the market with NVIDIA making up the rest. NVIDIA grew strongly for the next two years but Xeon Phi has started taking back share again. As a result, in 2016, Intel's combined technologies gained back some market to end at 84%.Because of the huge opportunity, Intel will be devoting more R&D dollars to strengthen this business and its new chips starting from the last iteration of 10nm will be first available to its data center customers. Increasing costs will therefore have a negative impact on this business over the next few years.In 2017, management expects revenue growth in the low single digit range, a gross margin of around 63% and EPS of around $2.80. DCG will be up high single digits, CCG will be down mid single-digits, NSG up 20%+, IoTG up 10%+ and PSG up mid-single-digits.Intel expects to spend $12 billion (+/- $500 million) on capex this year, of which $2.5 billion will be on memory. But capacity additions will account for most of the rest.Management also pointed to future opportunities: memory ($100 billion TAM), autonomous vehicles in 2025 ($10 billion TAM) and 5G connected devices (more than $50 billion TAM).Intel's U.S. Factory Endears It to TrumpIntel CEO Brian Krzanich met with Trump and promised to invest an additional $7 billion in an Arizona factory it originally started building back in 2011. The plant will employ 3K high-tech high-wage employees and it is estimated that indirect jobs relating to it will take employment up by about 10K.Intel has struggled to take the x86 architecture below 10nm, which could be partially responsible for construction being put on hold. Intel is one of the few technology companies that stuck with its U.S. fabs as a matter of policy even when many of its peers moved offshore. Intel owns leading edge IP that it wouldn't want to outsource to places where IP laws are suspect.The CEO made no bones about the fact that conducive tax and regulatory measures had prompted the company's decision to complete the investment now, so he may have eked out some concessions from Trump.Apple Sells More Smartphones Than SamsungAccording to IDC data published Feb 1, Apple shipped slightly more smartphones in the holiday quarter than Samsung, despite the fact that iPhone shipments were down for the first time in 2016. This is the first time in five years that the company gained the top spot.Apple's success was attributed to the iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Samsung said the exploding phones cost it $3 billion in sales. Overall smartphones grew just 2.3% in 2016 compared to 10.4% the previous year. Apple's 4.7% growth rate was better than the industry. Samsung shipments declined 5.2%.IDC expects the market to rebound this year, in part because of expectations of a landmark phone from Apple and renewed demand in the Middle East and Latin America, which didn't have a good 2016. Separately, Canaccord Genuity has said that while Apple accounted for just 18% of the smartphone market last quarter, it took 92% of the profits.Google Selling Its Satellite CompanyGoogle has agreed to sell its high-resolution satellite imaging business, Terra Bella, to imaging startup Planet Labs for somewhere between $300 and $500 million. Planet Labs has a number of medium resolution satellites that will complement the ones it has acquired, according to Planet.Google is not quitting the mapping business and a long-term agreement to license the technology back from Planet is reportedly a part of the deal. This may not be a hugely profitable deal for Google given that it originally acquired Terra Bella for $500 million in 2014 when the company was called Skybox. But it may be a part of the realignment of its business units and goals under CFO Ruth Porat.CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.36%+22.12%FB+2.45%+7.12%GOOGL+1.79%+3.68%MSFT+0.50%+10.23%INTC-3.23%+0.86%CSCO+0.61%+1.61%AMZN+2.12%+7.94%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateApple Submits on Aussie Bank Boycott: Apple has submitted a statement to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) charging the top four banks (Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp. and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd) in Australia of delaying the expansion of Apple Pay, which could prove detrimental to smaller card issuers while reducing options for consumers.The banks, which are in the process of developing their own mobile technology, are seeking to bargain collectively with Apple to have their apps included in Apple Pay. Apple would rather have card issuers add their cards to its wallet and have the banks pay for inclusion. Apple said it won't give the banks a ""free ride"" while the banks responded saying Apple's assertion was ""incorrect and unsupported."" In its draft ruling, the ACCC denied the banks' request. The final ruling is expected in March.Apple Hires Away Amazon Executive: Timothy D. Twerdahl, who formerly headed Amazon's Fire TV unit as its general manager and director, has now joined Apple as its VP in charge of marketing Apple TV. Pete Distad who previously played that role will now help Apple negotiate content deals. Twerdahl has vast experience in streaming: before his four-year stint at Amazon he was VP of consumer devices at Roku and before that, he was an executive at Netflix. The executive changes seem to indicate that Apple is finally going to make some bold moves in this business, which hasn't really done that well versus competitors.Facebook VR Demo Stations Shutting Down: Facebook (FB) is closing down around 200 of its 500 VR demo stations at Best Buy stores. It appears that the Oculus wasn't as much of a success as anticipated because few people came in for a demo at all and store attendants said that frequent software issues with the headsets made them unsellable. But the headsets aren't going out of circulation. The stores will continue to sell them and Facebook has promised that there will be pop up and other stores that will continue with the demos. The program started with 50 stores that were later expanded to 500 in August last year.Facebook Hires MTV Executive: Facebook is very serious about content, video content in particular. On the earnings call, Zuckerberg mentioned how video was the next big thing just like mobile. So it has done everything possible to help share videos of every description and host Facebook Live streams. But in order to increase differentiation and the price of ads running adjacent to these videos,Facebook needs a little bit more. And now it's apparent that that is original content. The company has snapped up Mina Lefevre, who was in charge of scripted programming at MTV to head up its content development efforts. She will report to Ricky Van Veen, co-founder of CollegeHumor.Legal/RegulatoryMicrosoft Battles with Govt Spying: The court hasn't allowed the government's request to throw out a MicrosoftMSFTlawsuit, in which it contended that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act violates the first amendment. The act allows the government to issue gag orders when asking for data housed on third-party servers like those owned by Microsoft.The Justice Department had asked the government to dismiss the lawsuit saying that it needed to keep investigations confidential so as not to alarm possible wrong-doers and that they did eventually get to know when charges were filed. Microsoft succeeded in convincing the judge that this affected its ability to do business. But the court held that Microsoft couldn't assert constitutional rights for someone else, so it couldn't talk on behalf of its customers.Google Wants Warrants for Govt Snooping: Google's head of information security Richard Salgado visited senators to speed up the passage of a bill that has previously been endorsed by the House of Representatives. The bill seeks to do away with one clause of the current law that allows the government to obtain access emails that are more than 180 days old without a warrant. Google would like the law to be applicable for all emails irrespective of age. The bill was in the hands of Senator Jeff Sessions prior to the elections, when he was elevated to the position of Attorney General by President Trump.New Technology/ProductsCisco Announces First SIG: CiscoCSCOhas created a new Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) in the cloud that will allow on-field or mobile enterprise users to connect securely to the Internet even when they aren't connected through VPN. Cisco's solution is called Umbrella. Umbrella can identify which SaaS apps are being used and enforce policies to block risky or inappropriate apps; analyze over 100 billion internet requests every day, correlating with over 11 billion historical events to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and create models to automatically uncover attacker infrastructure being staged for the next threat; and other security checks through machine learning, Cisco Talos threat intelligence, and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP).Microsoft Extends Support to Cloud Customers: Boston Consulting Group says that while IP lawsuits have increased 22% over the last five years, patent trolls - companies that don't have a business but acquire patents to benefit from litigation - increased patent acquisitions by 35%. It is perhaps these trends that prompted Microsoft to expand its patent protection coverage to all users of its Azure infrastructure. Microsoft will give customers one of its own patents to help them deal with the litigation. Microsoft also expanded its indemnification program under which it provides funds or legal counsel to help customers defend themselves.M&A and CollaborationsNES and Google Have a Deal: Nashville Electric Service has withdrawn its lawsuit against the Metro Council and telecom companies filed last October, after Google promised to indemnify it against liabilities that may arise out of Metro's One Touch Make Ready policy. The current law requires that when a new provider's line is added to a utility pole, each existing provider is required to move its line, resulting in needless delay and disruption on the sidewalk.The new policy allows one person to move the poles, thus making the process more efficient. Existing providers like AT&T and Comcast object to the law on the grounds that Metro is not authorized to make the law, which is a matter for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The deal is significant because NES owns 80% of the utility poles in Nashville and Google is likely to succeed because the action promotes competition in the market and can force incumbents to match Google Fiber's high-speed services.Some NumbersMicrosoft Azure Price Cuts: Microsoft has taken the lead in announcing price cuts for its Azure Virtual Machines. The company said that compute-optimized F Series instances would cost its customers up to 24% less, while A1 Basic instances would drop by up to 61%. Azure HotBlock Blob Storage and Cool Block Blob Storage costs are also down. Suntrust analyst Kunal Madhukar expects Amazon to follow soon, as price cuts are ""business as usual"" for cloud infrastructure service providers.Amazon Payments: Amazon's payments service called Pay With Amazon, which allows people to check out quickly using the details saved on Amazon says that the service now has 33 million users, 32% of which access it with mobile devices. Pay With Amazon had 23 million users last April. Amazon's alliances with companies like PrestaShop, Shopify and Future Shop have brought more users over the past few months.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Reasons to Bet on Cisco (CSCO) Stock Ahead of Earnings;2/15/2017;"Cisco (Shutterstock photo)Cisco (CSCO) is set to report second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell today. With fiscal 2016 revenues climbing less than 1%, the San Francisco-based networking giant has a lot to prove in 2017. But you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more stable large-cap company, which still has a virtually monopoly when it comes to hardware/software that powers the internet.CSCO stock closed Tuesday at $32.31, netting yet another 52-week high. The shares have risen about 7% year to date and almost 30% over the past year. This afternoon, analysts will be eager to see the extent to which Cisco’s big bets on software have paid off, particularly on the heels of its multibillion-dollar software acquisition of AppDynamics for which Cisco paid roughly twice what AppDynamics was to get in its own public offering.makeArticleAd();For the quarter that ended January, Cisco is expected to earn 56 cents per share on revenue of $11.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 57 cents per share on $11.93 billion in revenue.Cisco, which in November reported first-quarter earnings results that beat Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines, has focused on higher-margin businesses such as the Internet of Things and the cloud is working to reverse the recent slide in revenue. Software initiatives that focus on enhancing its capabilities in visualization and security will also be a focus of analysts this afternoon.From an investment perspective, Cisco offers many qualities that should appeal to value seekers.Despite the solid year-to-date performance, CSCO stock is priced at just 13.8 times forward earnings, which is some six points below the S&P 500 Index. Assuming the stock was priced on par with the rest of the market the stock would trade today at around $45, or 40% above current levels.Combined with Cisco's strong dividend yield of 3.30%, which is more than one full percentage point above the rest of the market, there are tons of reasons to be bullish on Cisco for the next 12 to 18 months. Assuming a beat on raise this afternoon, CSCO stock, which has a consensus Buy rating, should reach $40 by the end of 2017, delivering 25% returns."

Wednesday’s Vital Data: Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), Cisco Systems, Inc (CSCO) and Twitter Inc (TWTR);2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street digests the latest comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. Before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, Yellen offered an upbeat view of the U.S. economy and said that the Fed could raise rates sooner than later. Yellen will offer additional commentary later this morning before the House Financial Services panel.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave added 0.01%, withNasdaq-100futures down 0.18% andS&P 500futures off 0.2%.On the options front, volume remained well above average on Tuesday. Overall, roughly 16.9 million calls and 14.1 million puts changed hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio plunged to a three-month low of 0.53, sending the 10-day moving average diving to a one-month low of 0.66.Turning to Tuesday's volume leaders,Micron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU) saw call volume ramp up considerably after reports that it is seeking buyers for its NOR flash memory business. Elsewhere,Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) attracted a flood of call volume heading into tonight's quarterly earnings report, andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) rebounded sharply from post-earnings lows amid news that CEO Jack Dorsey bought roughly $7 million in TWTR stock during the recent plunge.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)After helping to lead the semiconductor sector to record gains in 2016, MU stock is having a bit of trouble moving higher so far in 2017. The shares are up a mere 5.5% year-to-date after being rejected by resistance near $25. But Micron is still on the warpath in the chip sector, withreports surfacing yesterdaythat the company is looking to sell its NOR flash business in a move to focus on the more-profitable DRAM and 3D NAND flash markets.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteWhile MU stock dipped more than 3% on the news - investors appear worried about market saturation in the memory market - the long-term outlook for Micron should improve with the sale. It may have been this logic that pushed MU options traders heavily toward calls yesterday, as these typically bullish bets made up 76% of the more than 292,000 MU options contracts traded.Looking out to the March series, MU options traders remain heavily bullish on the stock. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.69, with calls easily outnumbering puts. That said, peak March call OI totals more than 21,000 contracts at the $25 strike, and could create some headwinds for the shares on any breakout attempts.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)Blue-chip networking giant Cisco Systems steps into the earnings confessional after the close today, with Wall Street looking for a profit of 56 cents per share on revenue of $11.55 billion. Cisco has made significant strides in networking cloud services in prior quarters, and another solid push in this market could be a much needed shot in the arm for the shares - especially with CSCO stock flirting with key resistance in the $32 region.CSCO options traders have sided with the bulls ahead of tonight's report, with calls making up 66% of the more than 260,000 contracts traded on Tuesday. However, taking a closer look reveals that one trader opened a neutral-to-bullish calendar spread at the April $31 and October $33 strikes, according toTrade-Alert.com.This spread went off at the ask of 15 cents, or $15 per contract, and benefits from declining implieds in the wake of Cisco's quarterly report - so long as the stock doesn't rocket too far above $33 over the short-term and the trader isn't assigned prior to expiration.Twitter Inc (TWTR)Bargain hunting is the name of the game for TWTR stock this week, and the shares rebounded some 4.5% yesterday after bottoming near $15.50 in the wake of an abysmal quarterly earnings report. Helping to push TWTR higher was none other than CEO Jack Dorsey, whosnapped up roughly $7 million in TWTR stockat prices ranging from $15.84 to $16.60 per share beginning on Monday, per an SEC filing.LendingClub Corp (LC) Stock Isn't Doomed After Q4 Earnings, But ...TWTR options traders joined in the ride, sending 270,000 contracts across the tape, 62% of which were of the call variety. What's more, options traders still have a rather bullish short-term outlook for TWTR stock, with the March put/call OI ratio coming in at 0.59.The hottest March option strike for TWTR is the $20 call, where more than 47,000 contracts are currently open. This seems more than a touch optimistic, as TWTR stock hasn't traded north of $20 since October.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayThe postWednesday's Vital Data: Micron Technology, Inc.

Better Buy: Cisco Systems, Inc. vs. General Electric;2/14/2017;"At first glance,Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andGeneral Electric(NYSE: GE) don't seem that similar. The former sells networking   hardware and software, while the latter sells a wide array of   industrial products and services for the utility, healthcare,   transportation, aviation, and automotive industries.But if we look closer, some similarities appear. Both   companies are Dow components and are generally owned for income   instead of growth. Both companies are also aggressively expanding   into theInternet of Things (IoT), which links various objects to each other and the cloud. Cisco   estimates that the total number of connected devices across the   IoT, including GE's industrial machinery, will double from 25   billion in 2015 to  50 billion in 2020.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Cisco and GE are both slow-growth plays, yet both stocks have   rallied more than 50% over the past five years. But since past   performance doesn't guarantee future gains, we should take a   closer look at their core businesses to see if they can keep   rising over the next few years.How fast are Cisco and GE growing?Cisco's revenue stayed nearly flat at $49.2 billion in    fiscal 2016. But after excluding the sale of its set-top   box to Technicolor for $600 million, its full-year revenue rose   3% to $48.7 billion. Cisco's revenue grew  1% annually on   that same ""normalized"" basis during the first quarter, but is   expected to decline 2%-4% annually during the second quarter.   Analysts expect Cisco's reported revenue to fall 2% in fiscal   2017, but potentially rebound 2% in 2018.That lackluster growth is mainly attributed to the sluggish   growth of its core businesses of networking routers and switches,   which generated nearly half its revenue last quarter. The only   part of Cisco which posts consistent growth is its cybersecurity   business, which posted 11% sales growth during the first quarter   but only accounts for 4% of its top line. Looking ahead, Cisco is   expected to acquire more companies to strengthen its hardware and   software bundles while boosting its top line growth.Image source: Cisco.General Electric's revenue rose 5% to $123.7 billion in fiscal   2016. The company's top line received a big boost from its $10   billion purchase of  Alstom's power division in late 2015.   GE's core businesses also grew on robust demand across the   aviation, renewables, healthcare, and oil and gas industries. Its   healthcare business benefited from solid growth in China, and its   oil and gas business was lifted by reboundingoil   prices. Orders for wind turbines also rose on an increased appetite for   renewable energy solutions worldwide.GE's backlog -- a key indicator of future demand -- rose 2% to   $321 billion in 2016. Looking ahead, analysts expect GE's revenue   to rise 2% in fiscal 2017 and 7% growth in 2018. But on an   organic basis, which excludes currency impacts, acquisitions, and   divestments, GE expects its revenue to rise 3%-5% in fiscal   2017.How profitable are Cisco and GE?Since Cisco and GE are both heavily exposed to currency   headwinds and often acquire or divest units, which distorts   year-over-year comparisons, they report their earnings in both   GAAP and non-GAAP figures.On a non-GAAP basis -- which excludes currency impacts,   stock-based compensation, certain acquisitions, divestments, and   other charges -- Cisco's earnings rose 8% in fiscal 2016.   GAAP-adjusted earnings, which include the gain from the set-top   box divestment, rose 21%. Analysts expect Cisco's non-GAAP   earnings to remain nearly flat in 2017 and rise 5% in 2018.GE's total earnings remained flat on a GAAP basis in fiscal   2016. However, its non-GAAP earnings (which include its   industrial operating and related verticals) rose 14% during the   year. On that basis, analysts expect GE's earnings to rise 10% in   2017 and another 16% in 2018.Dividends and valuationsCisco currently pays a forward yield of 3.3%, which is   supported by a payout ratio of 47%. It's raised that dividend   annually for the past six years. GE also pays a forward yield of   3.3%, but it has a much less sustainable payout ratio of 106%,   due to the Alstom acquisition throttling its cash flows. GE   raised its dividend by a penny last December, but that was its   first hike intwo years.Cisco trades at 15 times earnings, which is lower than the   S&P 500's current P/E of 24 and the industry average of 25   for networking and communication device makers. GE trades at 25   times earnings, which is higher than the S&P 500's multiple   but lower than the average P/E of 39 for diversified machinery   companies.The winner: CiscoGeneral Electric initially seems like a better pick than   Cisco, since it has better top and bottom line growth and a more   diversified business. But GE's poor record of dividend hikes,   high payout ratio, and frothy valuation indicate that it's a   riskier buy than Cisco at current prices. With the market   hovering near all-time highs, I'd rather stick with Cisco as a   fundamentally cheap play with a reliable dividend.10 stocks we like better than General ElectricWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What to Expect When Cisco Systems Reports Earnings;2/14/2017;"Expectations are low going intoCisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) fiscal second-quarter report. The networking   hardware giant expects the troubles of the first quarter to   continue, with its guidance calling for a sizable year-over-year   revenue decline, even after excluding divestitures.Growth businesses like collaboration, data center, and   security have helped the company grow in recent quarters despite   weakness in the core switching and routing segments, but two of   those businesses suffered declines during the first   quarter. Here's what to look for when Cisco reports on   Wednesday.What analysts are expectingThe average analyst estimate calls for a year-over-year   revenue decline of 3.2%, to $11.55 billion. That's near the   midpoint of Cisco's guidance range -- a decline of 2% to 4%.   Cisco's outlook excludes revenue from the SP Video CPE business,   which the company agreed to sell back in 2015.makeArticleAd();That deal closed in November 2015, about one month into the   fiscal second quarter. The discrepancy between Cisco's reported   and adjusted revenue in the second quarter will only include one   month of that divested revenue, and the transaction will be fully   lapped in the fiscal third quarter.Image source: Cisco Systems.Cisco reported a revenue decline of 3% and an adjusted revenue   increase of 1% during the first quarter, so the company's   second-quarter guidance represents a deterioration. The companypointed to global uncertainty, driven by the U.S. presidential election, as one reason for its   weak guidance. Cisco isn't modeling any improvement going   forward, but it does believe that business-friendly polices from   the Trump administration could reverse some of these   headwinds.Cisco expects to produce GAAP earnings per share (EPS)   between $0.42 and $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.55 and   $0.57, during the second quarter. That compares to GAAP EPS of   $0.62 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 during the prior-year period.A $519 million tax benefit boosted GAAP EPS last year, so the   steep decline called for in Cisco's guidance isn't something to   worry about. Analysts are expecting non-GAAP EPS of $0.56, right   at the midpoint of Cisco's guidance range.Despite the weak numbers Cisco expects to report, it's likely   that the company will announce a dividend boost along with its   second-quarter report. Cisco announced a 24% increase to its   quarterly dividend in February of last year, along with a massive   $15 billion share-buyback authorization. Any dividend increase   this year will almost certainly be smaller, but a high   single-digit or low double-digit percentage boost would still be   a nice reward for long-term investors.Pay attention to the growth businessesCisco's first-quarter results, while beating analyst   estimates, were disappointing due to the severe slowdown of the   company's main growth businesses. The data center segment, which   was growing by more than 20% annually as recently as late 2015,   has now been weak for multiple quarters. The segment posted a 3%   year-over-year decline during the first quarter, with the company   blaming a shift from blade servers to rack servers for the   disappointing performance.The collaboration segment, which produces about $4.4 billion   of revenue annually, has also slowed down. The segment grew by 9%   during fiscal 2016, but the first quarter, saw a 3%   year-over-year decline. One thing hurting the top line is Cisco's   ongoing shift to subscription software. Collaboration-deferred   revenue rose by 14% in the first quarter, and order growth was   solid despite the revenue weakness.The security business has managed to continue growing at a   double-digit rate, driven, in part, by acquisitions. Security   revenue expanded by 11% year over year during the first quarter,   and investors should expect to see continued growth in the second   quarter. This will help offset some of the weakness in other   areas.Cisco is a company in transition, shifting toward software and   subscriptions while remaining dependent on sales of its core   switching and routing hardware. The first quarter was lackluster,   and the second quarter will be worse if Cisco hits its guidance.   A likely dividend hike will provide some good news, but investors   should be prepared for another weak quarterly report.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Jeremy Grantham Trims Consumer Defensive and Technology Empire;2/13/2017;"Jeremy Grantham(Trades,Portfolio), chairman of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., is regarded as a knowledgeable investor in various stock, bond and commodity markets. During fourth-quarter 2016, Grantham trimmed positions inProctor & Gamble Co.(PG),Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO),Microsoft Corp.(MSFT) andQualcomm Inc.(QCOM).Proctor & GambleGrantham sold 3,100,701 shares of Proctor & Gamble, nearly 99% of his stake in the company. P&G's stock price averaged $85.23 during fourth-quarter 2016, and the company currently trades at $88.10 per share.makeArticleAd();Although P&G's profit margins and returns outperform close to 90% of competitors, the company has negative three-year revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share growth rates, suggesting decreasing growth potential.P&G reported modest earnings performance in its fiscal second-quarter, including flat net sales compared to the prior-year quarter. Organic sales increased 2% overall, offset by a -2% impact from foreign exchange. Additionally, the company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 8% from the prior-year quarter. For fiscal 2017, P&G expects its all-in sales to be on par with fiscal 2016 sales: although the company expects organic sales to grow by 2-3%, the headwinds from foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures offset the organic sales growth.As the company's price, price-book ratio and price-sales ratio are all near a 10-year high, P&G is significantly overvalued. The company's current price is close to its maximum price-sales valuation based on its P/S valuation bands chart. P&G is also overvalued based on several other valuation methods, including the earnings power value method and the projected free cash flow method.P&G's Yacktman forward-rate of return of 3.02% is near a 10-year low and underperforms 55% of global household & personal products companies. As the company offers low growth potential, the Yacktman Focused Fund (Trades, Portfolio) pared 0.99% of its stake in P&G.Cisco SystemsGrantham axed 26.15% of his stake in Cisco Systems, selling 6,169,165 shares at an average price of $30.49. With this transaction, the fund manager trimmed 0.92% off his portfolio.Cisco has a profitability rank of 9 and a four-star predictability rank, which normally suggests high growth potential. Despite having profit margins near a 10-year high, Cisco has returns on equity below its 10-year average. Additionally, the company's per-share revenue growth has slowed down, with a one-year revenue growth rate of -0.2%.For fiscal first-quarter 2017, Cisco reported revenues of $12.4 billion, net income of $2.3 billion and diluted earnings of 46 cents per share. Net income and diluted earnings declined 4% from the prior-year quarter while revenues increased just 1%. CEO Chuck Robbins expressed that Cisco, despite a ""challenging global business environment,"" still managed to lead customers in digital transformations through ""highly secure, automated and intelligent solutions.""Although management gave positive remarks about the company's performance, Cisco expects to have weaker earnings performance for fiscal second-quarter, including a normalized revenue decline of 2% to 4% year over year (not including SP Video CPE Business revenues from fiscal second-quarter 2016). The company also expects fiscal second-quarter EPS to fall within 42 cents to 47 cents, suggesting a potential decrease in earnings for the upcoming quarter.As the company has low earnings potential in the short term, several gurus reduced their position in Cisco Systems. Tweedy Browne (Trades, Portfolio) knocked off 9.34% while Steven Romick (Trades, Portfolio) trimmed 8.93%. John Hussman (Trades, Portfolio) axed 58.96% of his Cisco position, selling all but 104,400 shares.MicrosoftGrantham removed 17.45% of his Microsoft position, selling 2,981,525 shares at an average price of $60.15. With this transaction, the guru trimmed his portfolio 0.81%.Although Microsoft reported strong cloud revenues during fourth-quarter 2016, deeper analysis of the company's historical profitability and growth metrics suggests a modest financial outlook for early 2017. Microsoft's operating margins, despite outperforming 89% of global infrastructure companies, is currently near a 10-year low of 19.41%. Additionally, Microsoft's five-year average operating margin growth rate and gross margin growth rate are -10.30% and -4.80%, despite the company having gross margins of about 58.90%.PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio), who currently owns the largest number ofMicrosoft sharesamong gurus, pared 5.21% off its stake.QualcommGrantham reduced his Qualcomm position 17.89%, selling 1,482,356 shares at an average price of $67.18. With the transaction, the guru trimmed his portfolio 0.48%.On a non-GAAP basis, Qualcomm reported good earnings performance in fiscal first-quarter 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter. Despite this, Qualcomm had a poor quarter based on GAAP results, with operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share declining about 54% year-over-year and 57% from the prior quarter. The GAAP values included an $868 million accrued expense for fiscal first-quarter 2017 related to the Korea Free Trade Commission investigation.Qualcomm's operating margin is near a 10-year low of 21.37% despite outperforming 93% of global semiconductor companies. The company's operating margin declined 5% on average for the past five years. Additionally, Qualcomm's gross margin declined 2.6% on average.While Qualcomm's three-year average buyback rate outperforms 97% of competitors, the company bought back the overvalued shares. Qualcomm's stock price is trading about 17.2% lower than the average buyback price. The company also issued about $11.7 billion in long-term debt within the past three years.Disclosure:I do not have positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

3 Internet of Things Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit;2/13/2017;"The technology sector isn't always the best place for   investment stability, nor are new technology trends ever much of   a safe investment. But it doesn't have to be this way. The   Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of   technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be   connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at   the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain   steady, long-term investments:Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Verizon CommunicationsVerizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of   long-term potential in the IoT. The company already   dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat   competition fromAT&TandT-Mobile, and it's only getting stronger.Verizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should   give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network   space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead   of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the ""foundation for creating   more internet-connected devices"" and says that it will use the   network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and   other city systems online.Over the next few months, the company plans on rolling out   commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell   McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he   believes the company is two to three years ahead of the   competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's   recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO   Communications.5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device   connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off   down the road.Cisco SystemsCisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in   its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and   at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot.Cisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but   one of biggest moves came early last year when the company   announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion.Jasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows   enterprise and service customers to ""launch, manage and monetize   IoT services on a global scale."" In short, Jasper allows   companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet   engines) and then manage those connections through its   proprietary software.Jasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around   the world that have devices running on 27 service providers.   And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's   services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions,   and advanced analytics.With Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the   software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring   revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the   traditionally cyclical hardware market.AlphabetAlphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive   in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and   its quarterly revenues north of  $26 billion, this is   certainly a company investors don't need to babysit.Most of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which   is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home   and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home,   along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the   company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections.But one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from   a company called Waymo, which wasrecently spun out of Google. Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world   testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company   to now stand on its own and start generating revenue.Waymo has partnered withFiat Chryslerto bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin   testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely   still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for   Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella   self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans.On top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring   IoT possibilities, like usingnanoparticles to find diseasesin the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices.Whatever you do, just don't miss this opportunityInvestors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook themassive opportunities that the IoT has to   offer.

One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Cisco Systems;2/13/2017;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the June 2018 expiration for CSCO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $25 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.19. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.8% return against the $25 commitment, or a 3.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSCO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems Inc sees its shares decline 21.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $23.81 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.19 from $25), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.6% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.6% figure actually exceeds the 3.3% annualized dividend paid by Cisco Systems Inc, based on the current share price of $31.84. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 21.43% to reach the $25 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for CSCO below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.3% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the June 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $37 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.00 bid, annualizes to an additional 2.4% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 5.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $37 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CSCO shares would have to climb 16.3% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 19.4% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Cisco Systems Inc, highlighting in green where the $25 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $37 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cisco Systems Inc (considering the last 251 trading dayCSCO historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $31.84) to be 16%.Top YieldBoost CSCO Calls »"

2 Rock Solid Cheap Stocks with P/Es Under 15;2/13/2017;"With the market hovering near all-time highs, it might seem   tough to find ""cheap"" stocks that are still worth buying. But   with the S&P 500's P/E ratio currently near a multi-year high   of 24, investors should focus on undervalued stocks with less   room to fall. Let's take a closer look at two big tech names that   have P/E ratios of 15 or less --Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) andHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) .Cisco SystemsCisco is one of the world's largest vendors of networking   hardware and software. Its core businesses of routers and   switches are slow growth -- sales of routers fell 4% in    fiscal 2016, while sales of switches stayed flat. Those two   businesses accounted for nearly half of its top line during the   year.Image source: Cisco.makeArticleAd();Both businesses face twomajor headwinds-- the rise of cheaper rivals likeHuawei, and companies likeArista Networks, which specializes in hardware for SDN (software-defined   networking) solutions. SDN (or cloud networking) platforms reduce   the need for on-site hardware like routers and switches.However, Cisco is diversifying away from those businesses with   increased investments in higher-growth businesses likecybersecurity, collaboration, and service provider video solutions -- which it   can bundle with its networking hardware. It also expanded its   presence in the Internet of Things (IoT) market with its   acquisition of Jasper Technologies, and will strengthen its   networkwide app analytics capabilities with its planned purchase   of AppDynamics.Cisco plans to use its robust free cash flow ($12.4 billion   over the past 12 months) to buy more companies, boost its   earnings with buybacks, and pay out dividends. On the surface,   Cisco's growth looks glacial, with analysts expecting a 2% sales   decline and nearly flat earnings growth this year. But Cisco's   P/E of 15 is also much lower than its industry average of 25, and   its forward dividend yield of 3.3% easily beats the S&P 500's   average yield of 2% -- making it a good conservative income play   for 2017.Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett-Packard Enterprise retained HP's enterprise hardware   and software businesses after splitting with the PC, printer, and   imaging businesses. But like many of its industry peers, HPE has   struggled to grow its top line amid sluggish enterprise spending,   macroeconomic issues, currency headwinds, and rising competition   from smaller rivals. Analysts expect HPE's revenue to dip 2% this   year and remain flat next year.HPE's CEO is Meg Whitman, who previously led both halves of   HP. Whitman's core strategy has been to streamline the enterprise   business with divestments, spinoffs, and layoffs. Prior to the   big split, HP exited the highly competitive public cloud market   to focus more on on-site and hybrid deployments.Image source: HPE.After the split, HPE agreed to spin off and merge its   slow-growth IT services unit withComputer Science Corp.in an $8.5 billion deal, then agreed to a similar spin-off of its   ""non-core"" application delivery management, big data, and   enterprise security businesses toMicro Focus Internationalin an $8.8 billion deal. Those spin-mergers resulted in several   rounds of layoffs, but those lower expenses boosted HPE's   margins. That's why analysts expect HPE's earnings to grow 6%   this year and another 1% next year.To pivot away from slow-growth businesses, HPE agreed to buy   smaller companies in high growth markets -- including   supercomputer maker SGI for $275 million and hyperconverged   infrastructure vendor SimpliVity for $650 million. Both   acquisitions strengthened HPE's position in the hybrid cloud   market. As HPE pivots toward more of these high growth   businesses, their revenues could juice up its top line growth   again.HPE's P/E of 13 is much lower than its industry average of 21,   and it pays a forward yield of 1%. That yield is low, but HPE's   payout ratio of 12% indicates that it has plenty of room to raise   its dividend in the near future.The key takeawayMany low P/E stocks tend to have low growth potential. Cisco   and HPE's growth won't impress analysts anytime soon, but their   low valuations will limit their downside potential during market   downturns. That stability could be valuable if the market's lofty   valuations catch up to it later this year.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Markets Climb Amid Solid Q4 Earnings;2/13/2017;"Monday, February 13, 2017makeArticleAd();Q4 earnings season even performed better than analysts had hoped for. Of course, we're not completely through the entire cycle - retailers have yet to report en masse, and we see industry leaders like CiscoCSCO, PepsiPEPand AIGAIGon the docket for this week - but we've seen enough results to know this is the best reporting quarter in the last two years.In fact, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian, Q4 remains on track to be the best earnings quarter ever. It's only the second quarter since we've finally dug out of the earnings recession we'd endured for the previous several quarters in a row. For a comprehensive take on Q4 earnings season, check out Sheraz's Earnings Preview report from Friday:Plenty of Positive Earnings NewsTeva PharmaceuticalsTEVAreported a solid quarterly earnings and revenue beat ahead of the opening bell today, citing positive synergies from its acquisition last year of Actavis, which it obtained from AllerganAGN. First Data Corp.FDCalso posted better-than-expected earnings during the pre-market today.Chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, appears on Capitol Hill this week, and observers will be playing close attention to whether or not she hints at the possibility of another interest rate hike at the Fed's March meeting. Currently, speculation is for a 17% chance of another quarter-point hike, to an overall Fed funds range of 75-100 basis points. A more hawkish tone from Yellen may help boost those odds.Market futures are very positive this morning, and continue to climb 20 minutes before the opening bell sounds: the S&P 500 is +6 points, the Dow +60 and Nasdaq +13. These are up from just about 15 minutes ago, when these figures were +4, +50 and +9, respectively.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Is a Surprise in Store for Five9 (FIVN) this Q4 Earnings?;2/13/2017;"Five9 Inc.FIVNis set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Feb 16. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 50%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayFive9 offers a virtual contact center cloud platform that acts as a hub for interaction between clients and customers. This facilitates contact center operations focused on inbound or outbound customer interactions within a single unified architecture. The company offers software products such as workforce management, speech recognition, predictive dialer and voice applications.The cloud-based contact center solution industry has been witnessing growth over the past several quarters as organizations are looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support. We believe that Five9 has been capitalizing on this opportunity, which should reflect in its to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company's sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio will aid its top-line performance.However, intensifying competition from small and large players like Cisco SystemsCSCOis likely to dent Five9's fourth-quarter performance.Five9, Inc.

Cisco, Deere, Pepsi and AIG are part of Zacks Earnings Preview;2/13/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 13, 2017 - Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises.

With another 53 index members on deck to report results next week, we will have seen results from more than 80% of the index's members by then.This earnings season has turned out to be good one. Not only is growth on track to be the highest in two years, but total earnings for the quarter are also on track to be a new quarterly record.Please recall that earnings growth turned positive only in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters.Importantly, the positive Q4 growth isn't a result of easy comparisons, but actually a function of strong gains in actual earnings. In fact, the overall tally of Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index is on track to reach an all-time record for the index, surpassing the previous record achieved in 2014 Q4.One other positive for this earnings season is the relatively modest negative revisions to current-quarter (2017 Q1) estimates; they have come down, but not by as much as has historically been the case.Q4 Scorecard(as of February 10, 2017)We now have Q4 results from 358 S&P 500 members, or 71.6% of the index's total membership. With 53 index members on deck to report results next week, we will have seen Q4 results from 80.2% of the index's total membership by the end of next week. The notable reports this week includeCisco(NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report),Deere & Co.(NYSE:DE-Free Report),Pepsi(NYSE:PEP-Free Report),AIG(NYSE:AIG-Free Report) and others.Total earnings for these 358 index members are up +6.1% on +4.6% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The Q4 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 358 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises (right-hand chart above) are tracking on the low side relative to historical periods, particularly on the earnings front. The 69% proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS estimates compares to 75.1% in the preceding quarter, 74.1% as the 4-quarter average and 72.4% as the 12-quarter average. Positive revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of companies in Q3, but are roughly in-line with historical periods.Standout SectorsSectors with strong growth and better than expected results (earnings & revenues) include the Finance, Construction, Technology, Utilities, And Business Services. Positive surprises for all of these sectors are tracking above the index level.Finance: With results from 79.9% of the sector's market cap in the S&P 500 index already out, total earnings for the sector are up +11.8% from the same period last year on +5% higher revenues, with +73.3% beating EPS estimates and +56% beating top-line estimates. This is better growth performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent periods.Strong Finance sector growth is a big driver of the aggregate growth performance for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 growth pace still compares favorably with other recent periods, but a lot less so.Technology: For the Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 88.6% of the sector's total market cap. Total earnings for these companies are up +8.2% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates.This is better earnings growth than we have seen from this same group of Tech companies in Q3 or the preceding four quarters, but is about in-line with the 12-quarter average. Revenue growth, on the other hand, is tracking above historical periods. The revenue outperformance is visible in terms of positive surprises as well, with the proportion of Tech sector positive surprises notably tracking above Q3, the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages, as you can see in the right-hand side chart. Earnings surprises (green bards in the right-hand chart) are tracking below historical periods, as is the case with other sectors as well.Q4 Expectations As a WholeFor Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 358 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come 142 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +7.5% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.7% growth in Q3 earnings on +2.2% higher revenues, the first instance of positive earnings growth for the index after five quarters of back-to-back declines. Comparisons for the Energy sector, a big driver of the earnings recession, turn positive in Q4, with the sector's earnings growth turning positive for the first time after 8 quarters of declines.For a complete analysis of the Q4 earnings season, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report -Positive Earnings Picture.About ZacksZacks.com is a property of Zacks Investment Research, Inc., which was formed in 1978.

Will Cisco (CSCO) Disappoint Estimates in Q2 Earnings?;2/13/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Cisco SystemsCSCOis set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 15. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 1.85%. However, excluding stock-based compensation, earnings decreased 3.3% from the year-ago quarter to 59 cents per share.Moreover, Cisco's second-quarter fiscal 2017 guidance was disappointing. Revenues (excluding the SP Video CPE Business) were expected to decline in the range of 2-4% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to weak order trend from service providers (down 12% in first-quarter). Notably, service providers comprise roughly 25% of the company's business.Further, non-GAAP earnings were anticipated to be in the range 55-57 cents per share. The company had reported earnings of 53 cents in the year-ago second quarter.The disappointing guidance affected Cisco's stock price. Since the announcement of first-quarter fiscal 2017 results (Nov 16, 2016) the stock has declined 0.1%, while the ZacksComputer Networkingindustry gained 0.6%.

3 Bellwether Earnings Announcements to Watch;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe first few weeks of every quarterly cycle lay out the broad strokes of how well U.S. companies as a group can justify another season of upside.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrWe know now that the bulls are back in control, but with around 850 companies reporting in the next five trading days, there are still plenty of details left to fill in - and it's attention to detail that gives focused investors like us a market edge.We talked recently about theearnings reports I'm watchingin the coming weeks to give us clues into the economies and sectors that have struggled in the past, and today I'd like to share a few thoughts.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsSo here are three more upcoming reports that should provide a good pulse on telecom, tech and the online consumer.Earnings to Watch: T-Mobile (TMUS)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)First up isT-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS), which on Tuesday morning might be the bright spot in an otherwise stagnant telecom sector.With most of the big carriers either in decline or actively bleeding cash, we're looking to TMUS to prove that this is still more than a zero-sum game - or at least that subscriber revenue falling away from other networks is collecting here to support renewed dividend payments.TMUS stated previously that it has added 2.1 million net customers, taking its total customer count to 71.5 million at the end of 2016. And if management held the bottom line steady, this might turn into one of the highlights of the season.Earnings to Watch: Cisco (CSCO)Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) needs to give shareholders at least a little hope that the network equipment business is turning around when it reports its quarterly results Wednesday night.As of now, the Street is looking for earnings of 56 cents a share and for revenues to decrease 3.2% year-over-year to $11.55 billion. We've had four quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue deterioration and odds are good the trend continues, which is why the outlook is critical next week.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayCSCO has coasted on ambient tech sector buzz, and it would be wonderful if this giant could start pulling its weight again and justify its valuations in the process.Earnings to Watch: Groupon (GRPN)Source: ShutterstockGroupon Inc(NASDAQ:GRPN) is a much smaller turnaround prospect, but I'll be watching its numbers Wednesday night for a better sense of how the consumer end of the online universe is holding up.Wall Street needs absolute clarity here: with close to 1,300% earnings reflation now baked into the share price, even a few thousand dollars more or less profit can throw the math in wide loops. While I hope the loop will point to the stratosphere, we'll simply have to watch and wait.I look forward to what the next round of earnings brings us, and it may even uncover a new buying opportunity or two. We'll just need to see how the actual results play out first.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

3 Big Bets Cisco Systems, Inc. Is Making -- Will They Be Enough?;2/10/2017;"Cisco Systems Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) has been best known in the past for its enterprise   network hardware, but the company continues to build out and grow   its other segments with some interesting recent innovations and   acquisitions. Here are some of the areas of growth Cisco is   betting on, the pressure it's getting from new competitors likeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , and why the stock looks like a fine holding as   the company transitions for the future.1: Building smart, connected citiesIn a recent blog post, Cisco management said that cloud   computing is ""the fourth industrial revolution."" The company   estimates that by 2020, over 90% of total data center traffic   will be via cloud networks. While there are many companies   working to provide services for individuals' and companies' cloud   needs, Cisco is gearing up to offer its services to cities around   the world.Cisco launched the ""Smart+Connected City Platform"" at   the Smart City Expo World Congress 2016 in Barcelona in   November, and the company says this service is ""a centralized   layer for addressing the infrastructural need to connect cameras,   water meters, traffic meters, and so on in a reliable, secure,   robust and seamless manner."" This initiative was recently   implemented in Jaipur, India, which joins Hamburg, Germany;   Barcelona, Spain; Kansas City, Missouri; and Adelaide, Australia   as test smart cities. The video below shows the CIO of Adelaide   explaining the importance Cisco has played in his city.makeArticleAd();2: Becoming an all-encompassing IoT platform""Internet of Things"" has become a buzzword in 2016, but really   it just describes the growing trend of consumer or otherwise   low-tech items that are being connected to the internet and to   each other, usually through a wireless cloud network. In fact,   the smart cities initiative is mostly about IoT on city level.   Estimates on just how big this market could be vary widely, but   most analysts predict it could continue growing by tens ofbillionsof devices in the next few years.Cisco is increasingly making itself the bedrock for various   parts of this ecosystem, including the actual hardware that makes   these consumer products connectivity possible, the connectivity   through cloud networks, and the security to make sure the IoT   connectivity isn't easily compromised. Cisco acquired a   cloud-based IoT company called Jasper Technologies last March for   $1.4 billion, which, among other things, enables more   data-tracking and IoT management. This acquisition and others   like it, along with Cisco's own innovation in this space, have   helped the company to launch various new products and bundles   into this space recently.Similar to Cisco's smart+connected cities push, the company   believes it has the breadth of expertise and support to be the   IoT platform for enterprise and governmental accounts. Remember   that Cisco already has a large footprint in these spaces, so it   might be easier for them to win over these big clients as they   seek an IoT solution.Image source: Cisco Systems.3: CybersecurityWhile the first two areas above are incredibly exciting in   terms of what they could mean for the future of the digital   world, they also open up the world to many more risks in the form   of cyber-threats. A recently intensified focus on hacking threats   and the need to build secure solutions throughout cloud networks,   IoT platforms, and all other connected technology creates an   opportunity Cisco is taking advantage of.In February, the company launched Cisco Firepower, a new   firewall series, and the company says its advanced security   systems have been proven to help customers ""dramatically reduce   time to detection of attacks."" Throughout the year, the company   also launched new tools such as Cisco Umbrella and Umbrella   Roaming, which are increased defenses on routers and VPN devices   to block suspicious activity. In September, Cisco   acquired CloudLock, a company that helps provide integrated   security solutions for cloud-based networks.Cisco's security revenue in its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 29 rose   11% from the year-earlier quarter to about $540 million. Even   though that makes up less than 5% of Cisco's total revenue,   management believes that having the focus and expertise in this   area will help them win over more business within its other   segments as consumers and businesses start to consider the need   for the most secure network possible a top priority.Can Cisco fend off competition?Cisco's traditional markets, which still make up the bulk of   sales, have declined in recent quarters. Switching, which still   makes up nearly a third of total sales, slumped 7% in the most   recent quarter year over year. Overall, even with the growth   above, total sales in the quarter gained a paltry 1%.   Additionally, management gave less-than-exciting guidance for   early fiscal 2017.More concerning is that in the company's new growth areas, it   faces some serious competition. The biggest of them   is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offers both public and   private cloud hosting solutions, as well as IoT solutions,   usually for a lower cost than traditional options. The service   has success stories from some big names likeNetflixandComcast, just to name a few, which has helped raise its prestige. In   terms of security, Amazon provides cloud services to U.S.   intelligence agencies, so clearly, security is important to them   as well. AWS is growing quickly -- up nearly 50% year over year   in the most recent quarter to over $3.5 billion.The early successes of the segments above are encouraging.   Additionally, Cisco has been able to gain a lot of expertise and   value from acquiring smaller tech companies in these high-growth   segments, and Cisco is in a great position to continue that   strategy with around $70 billion in cash that it's likely to   start deploying more heavily in the quarters and years to come.   While Cisco will certainly face increased growth pressure ahead,   especially with AWS disrupting this space, it looks to be making   some smart moves to transition its focus. Finally, Cisco is   trading at just 15 times earnings, just 2.5 times book value   (compared with Amazon's P/B at 21.7 times), and has a 3.3%   dividend yield that continues to grow. It looks like there's   plenty of reason to hold Cisco to see how these markets transform   in the years ahead -- and how this behemoth tech company will   play a part in them.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Cisco Systems;2/10/2017;"AtHoldings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 24 most recent 13F filings for the 12/31/2016 reporting period, and noticed that Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO) was held by 13 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose theirlongpositions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose theirshortpositions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the storybecause the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.makeArticleAd();Having given that caveat, we believe that looking atgroupsof 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in CSCO positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:FundNew Position?Change In Share CountChange In Market Value($ in 1000's)Madrona Financial Services LLCExistingUNCH-$11State Street CorpExisting+5,886,055-$141,172Meridian Investment Counsel Inc.Existing+219-$30Rand Wealth LLCExisting+4,225-$223Van Den Berg Management I Inc.ExistingUNCH-$38Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Public School       Empls Retrmt SYSExisting+494-$416Muhlenkamp & Co.

Worth noting is thatUSS Investment Management Ltd, included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited CSCO common stock as of 12/31/2016.Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the CSCO share count in the aggregate amongallof the funds which held CSCO at the 12/31/2016 reporting period (out of the 1,728 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of CSCO shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for CSCO. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 5,214,705 shares in the aggregate, from 711,957,235 down to 706,742,530 for a share count decline of approximately -0.73%.

3 Stocks to Watch in February;2/9/2017;"February will be a busy month for investors.NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) will report this week, looking to extend its   streak of impressive earnings beats. Networking hardware giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) reports next week, aiming to convince investors   that its transition to a softwarecentric company will eventually   return it to growth. Meanwhile,Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) will report in two weeks, in the midst of a major   shift in its e-commerce strategy .Sky-high expectationsGraphics chip company NVIDIA destroyed analyst estimates   throughout 2016, with its latest quarterly report in November   beating expectations by a wide margin. Its gaming business is   booming, driven by strong demand for its Pascal graphics cards   and the soon-to-launchNintendoSwitch game console. The data center and automotive businesses,   both much smaller than gaming, are growing at an even faster   rate.Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();When its fourth-quarter results are revealed after the market   close on Thursday, Feb. 9., all eyes will be on whether NVIDIA   can keep up its incredible growth rate. Its stock more than   tripled in 2016 as revenue and profit expanded rapidly, but withAMDset to launch competing high-end graphics cards in the next few   months, NVIDIA's significant market share may take a hit.NVIDIA's early focus on pushing its graphics chips as machine   learning accelerators has paid off in a big way. The data center   segment, which includes NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs aimed the data center   and high-performance computing , nearly tripled year over year   during the third quarter. That kind of growth rate can't go on   forever, but it's clear that NVIDIA has struck gold.With the stock now trading for around 60 times   trailing-12-month earnings, the company will need to continue to   impress investors in order to keep the stock price afloat. Any   disappointing numbers could send this highflier tumbling.A tough quarterCisco Systems, the dominant provider of networking hardware,   doesn't expect a remarkable fiscal second quarter. The company   sees its revenue declining by 2% to 4% year over year even after   excluding divestitures, a slowdown that reflects both uncertainty   among its major customers and its ongoing shift to a recurring   revenue business model.Image source: Cisco Systems.Cisco's core switching and routing businesses were   inconsistent throughout 2016, with growth in some quarters and   declines in others. This was counteracted by solid growth in its   smaller businesses, including collaboration, data center, and   security. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, though, both   the data center and collaboration segments suffered 3%   year-over-year revenue declines. Security posted a double-digit   increase, but the results raise questions about Cisco's growth   strategy.Its fiscal second-quarter results are expected after the   market close on Feb. 15. Analysts aren't expecting much, with the   average estimate calling for a 3.2% decrease in revenue and a   slight dip in adjusted earnings per share. Ciscorecently announced a major acquisition, agreeing to pay $3.7 billion for software company AppDynamics,   a move that should help accelerate its shift toward software. But   Cisco remains dependent on hardware, and weakness in its core   businesses will continue to hurt its results.Two-day shipping for everyoneAfter testing a subscription shipping program similar toAmazonPrime, Wal-Mart has scrapped that effort, instead shifting to   free two-day shipping on millions of items for orders over $35.   This is far more generous than Amazon's non-Prime free shipping   offer, which has a minimum order of $50 and shipping times that   vary.Image source:     Wal-Mart.http://corporate.walmart.com/galleries/e-commerceWal-Mart has been accelerating its push into e-commerce,   paying $3 billion for start-up Jet.com last year and putting   Jet's CEO in charge of its entire e-commerce business. The   company's online grocery service, which allows customers to place   orders online and pick up for free at hundreds of Wal-Mart   locations, is another facet of the e-commerce strategy, one that   can't be duplicated by online-only retailers.Wal-Mart will report its fourth-quarter results before the   market opens on Feb. 21. The retailer's e-commerce business has   been accelerating in recent quarters, a sign that the company's   initiatives are having a positive effect. Wal-Mart's stores are   still the core of the business, and they enable initiatives like   online grocery pickup. But Wal-Mart will need to greatly expand   its e-commerce business to avoid being left in the dust.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Burned by FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? Try These Rebound Trades;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere was much hype surroundingFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) back in 2015. The company had just come off revenue growth of 163% the year prior, and FireEye was the first cybersecurity firm to be certified under the Safety Act. But the company fell prey to a major faux pas in the technology world - it didn't innovate fast enough, and FEYE stock is now paying the price.makeArticleAd();Source:Fortune Brainstorm TECH via FlickrIn 2014, the cloud business model was breaking onto the scene, and it was creating enough of a stir that even major players likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) were making significant moves into the new market. It was a lesson FireEye learned too late, as evidenced by the company's recent quarterly earnings report.Despite a major push and a plethora of incentives to boost sales, FireEye's revenue of $184.7 million missed Wall Street's estimates of $191 million. But the topline figure wasn't the only concern, as FireEye guided to a 3% decline in first-quarter revenue, compared to the Street's expected 5% growth.Among the myriad of problems facing the company, including slower corporate enterprise spending and increased competition in the cybersecurity market, FireEye's late restructuring into a cloud-subscription model is almost unforgivable - especially when blue-chip security firms were already headed that direction.But there is a bright side for FEYE stock investors, at least over the short term. Barring any other major surprises or management short-sightedness (CFO Mike Berry and board chairman David DeWalt are both stepping down, which could help), the worst appears to be already factored into FEYE's price. As such, literally any positive news for the company could kick off a short-term bounce.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowAs usual, potential drivers for such a bounce would come from FEYE's sentiment backdrop. For instance, Thomson/First Call reports that 21 of the 31 analysts following FEYE stock rate the shares a ""hold"" or worse. The fact that there aren't more ""sell"" ratings after last week's quarterly report tells me that Wall Street is ready to reward FireEye for moving in the right direction. In other words, upgrades are a distinct possibility following any positive progress.Elsewhere, short sellers are already taking profits on FEYE. As of the most recent reporting period, the number of FEYE shares sold short dropped by 3% to 20.3 million. Still, roughly 13.3% of FireEye's float remains sold short, and could spark a round of profit taking or a covering rally if the stock can find its feet and move higher.Click to EnlargeJudging by FEYE's options configuration, short sellers may be preparing for just such an outcome. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio for FEYE stock rests at 0.44, with calls more than doubling puts among options set to expire on March 17.FEYE is trading well below all major put and call accumulations in the series, with the $13 strike home to peak put OI and $14 representing the next significant call OI strike, leaving little in the way of potential options headwinds in the short term.March implieds, meanwhile, are pricing in a potential move of about 12.6% for volatile FEYE stock. This places the upper bound at $12.39, while the lower bound rests at $9.61.2 Trades for FEYE StockCall Spread:Bearish sentiment on an underperforming stock is to be expected, but FEYE stock is trading at oversold levels following a post-earnings beating. With said beating now out of the way, FEYE should trend higher, with any positive news providing additional lift.Those traders looking to take a risk on an FEYE comeback over the short-term might want to consider a March $12/$13 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 19 cents, or $19 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $12.19, while a maximum profit of 81 cents, or $81 per pair of contracts, is possible if FEYE stock closes at or above $13 when March options expire.The Smart Money: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Already InsolventPut Sell:Those looking for a more bullish-to-neutral position may want to look at a FEYE March $10 put sell position. At last check, this put was bid at 25 cents, or $25 per contract. Remember that you keep the initial premium received as long as FEYE stock closes above $10 when March options expire. However, if FEYE trades below $10 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares of stock for every put sold at a cost of $10 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming ReboundThe 2 Best, and 2 Worst, Dow Dividend Stocks TodayThe postBurned by FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock?

Data source:MacroTrends.net.Obama took office at the tail end of the Financial Crisis.   Even though the administration enacted policies that would   typically seem to limit the earnings ability of some corporations   within the Dow, such as stricter reporting regulations, the   market rose handily (in percentage terms) during his eight years   in office. Setting aside any economic policies the Obama   administration enacted, the fact that President Obama took office   near the market's trough meant that the market, which is cyclical   in nature, had a much stronger chance of rebounding during his   tenure.Meanwhile, Trump assumed the presidency after an   eight-year-long bull run that saw no sustained corrections.   History shows that corrections happen at somewhat regular   intervals, and many market analysts believe one is due soon.   Based on how market the cycle has worked through recent decades,   it seems unlikely that we'll see consistent growth during   President Trump's tenure -- but, of course, it's not   impossible.What business leaders are sayingMany business leaders have been speaking optimistically of   Trump's proposed financial policies in their earnings calls.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins said during the company's fiscal   first-quarter earnings call in November, ""I think President-elect   Trump appears to be very business-oriented and is very focused on   driving the U.S. economy, and anytime the U.S. economy improves   that's certainly good for us.""Southwest Airlines(NYSE: LUV) is another company that is looking forward to lower   taxes and less regulation. In the most recent earnings call, CEO   Gary Kelly finished answering an analyst question about upcoming   policy changes by saying:""We've looked at the tax reform proposals and we're quite     excited about that on the corporate front, but that's just     about income tax. So that doesn't really speak to the very     heavy burden that we have for aviation taxes, which we also     want to take up with the administration. So, that's a long     answer to your question and I think the bottom line is: No, we     don't know anything specific yet, but we sure like what we're     hearing so far.""Of course, there's also rising concern among many CEOs and   other business leaders about how certain policies that have been   floated or initiated could negatively affect their businesses or   the broader economy. These include tariffs on imported goods and   the controversial executive order restricting travel to the   U.S.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) management has said positive things about   potential tax cuts, especially those related to repatriating cash   kept overseas, of which Apple has around $200 billion. However,   Apple is also one of the biggest companies that in recent weeks   have come out against Trump's immigration policy. And it is one   of many companies taking legal action against Trump's immigration   stance, citing (along with moral opposition) concerns that it   could ultimately damage the company financially.How to invest during a Trump presidencyThe Dow Jones' average price-to-earnings ratio is currently   around 20 -- relatively high by historic standards. Additionally,   you can probably expect politics, and the market's reaction to   them, to be volatile in the months and years ahead. Nonetheless,   that shouldn't scare away investors. As the investing proverb   goes: Time in the market is more important than timing the   market.Regardless of how you believe the stock market will perform   based on cyclicalty or political volatility -- barring a massive   shift in policy that derails corporate earnings ability, or a   major economic disaster resulting from an environmental, social,   or defense crisis -- you should note that the market performance   graph above has marched upward over the long term.As a long-term investor, you should continue to look for   valuable investments to buy and hold while also watching the   economic and political climate closely. And whatever you do,   remember that your investment horizon should be greater than four   -- or even eight -- years.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Surprise, Surprise: Google, Amazon, Microsoft All Donated to Trump's Inauguration;2/8/2017;"On Tuesday,Politico confirmedthat come of the biggest technology corporations in America donated to President Trump's inauguration last month, the same companies who have recently voiced opposition to the administration's controversial immigration policies.Citing federal ethics documents, as well as sources familiar with the matter,Politicoreported that AmazonAMZN, Alphabet's GoogleGOOGLdivision, and MicrosoftMSFTall donated both cash and services to the president's inauguration back in January. Microsoft, for example, contributed $250,000 in cash, in addition to the same amount in technology and other tools, on December 28 to the Presidential Inaugural Committee.Google apparently provided an unspecified cash donation and a YouTube livestream of the inauguration, while Amazon gave similar services including tech help and an undisclosed donation. FacebookFB, though giving no cash donation, did provide Instagram photo booths and a mini Oval Office for those celebrating.It's quite common for corporations to donate to inaugural committees, regardless of political party affiliation. Microsoft donated about $2 million in cash and services for President Obama's second inauguration, while BoeingBAgave $1 millionto President Trump's inaugural events despite the president's attacks on the airplane maker.Just last December, the top executives of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, as well as CiscoCSCO, IBMIBM, IntelINTC, OracleORCL, and TeslaTSLAmet with President Trump in a so-called tech summit where the group discussed the growing uncertainty over the then president-elect's economic policies and the impact on the tech industry.The meeting seemed to create a sense of peace between the president and the tech executives, especially after a bitter election season, but President Trump's recent executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States upended that concord. On Monday, over 100 tech companies, including many of the above as well as Apple (AAPL) and Twitter (TWTR),told a federal courtthat they ""oppose the president's executive order because it's bad for the country and hurts their ability to attract talent,"" notesPolitico.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Can FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a rough ride forFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) stock. FEYE stock went public in September 2013, priced at $20 per share. FireEye doubled on its first day of trading; it cleared $90 by March. A quick plunge followed, and after a modest rebound, shares have been in a consistent downtrend, falling from above $50 in June 2015 to a current price around $11.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)With FEYE stock now near an all-time low, investors are looking to see if there's a way to salvage some value.FireEye itself has been in the middle of a turnaround, to be sure. The company has cut costs, and worked to shift from legacy hardware products to a more cloud-based model. But the departure of the chairman and CFO after last week's Q4 earnings report could hamper those plans. Already, restructuring has left several key positions open and affected FireEye's sales and marketing efforts.There is a case for the company to be a takeover target, which almost certainly would value FEYE stock above current levels. But investors expecting a deal in the near-term seem likely to be disappointed. FireEye could be of interest to a larger player, but it still has a lot of work to do.What FireEye Needs To DoIt's always tempting to see a M&A opportunity in a growth stock that has fallen on hard times. According to aBloombergreport last year, FireEye already has turned down several buyout offers. Those deals almost certainly would have been struck at a price much higher than $11. Surely, the rumored buyers - among themInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) - would still be interested at a lower price?12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe problem, however, is that FEYE's business looks much worse than it did even six months ago. 2016 as a whole doesn't look that bad, to be sure: Revenue increased 15% over 2015, and the company managed to cut non-GAAP operating expenses by 3% at the same time. That combination moved FireEye closer to profitability: The non-GAAP loss narrowed from $1.61 per share to $0.99 per share.Those numbers don't show the real issue, however. Billings, which reflect revenue added in the quarter - not necessarily recognized sales - increased just 3% for the year. More concerning: That figure became progressively worse as the year went on. In Q1, billings growth was over 20%; in Q3, the figure increased just 4%. Q4 billings then declined 14% and the midpoint of Q1 guidance implies a 25% decrease next quarter.Nothing good will happen for FEYE stock until that trend is reversed. Acquirers don't want to buy a declining business. FireEye is already both unprofitable and burning cash. Declining billings will only worsen its losses. And FEYE can't blame its market. PeerFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT) announced 22% billings growth in its first quarter on the same day FEYE stock was plunging after its report. To be even considered as an M&A target with a market cap still over $2 billion, FireEye has to fix its sales problems.Can FEYE Stock Rebound Through M&A?For its part, FireEye management believes those issues will be fixed. After Q4, outgoing CFO Mike Berry said the company would return to growth in the second half of 2017. New cloud-based offerings and the recently rolled out Helix platform are projected to start boosting sales by then.The huge decline in product billings - down 50% in Q4, and guided the same in Q1 - will start to be lapped. And CEO Kevin Mandia pointed out on the Q4 call that FireEye for months had no head of sales, either worldwide or in Europe.Combined with easy comparisons, FEYE expects to get back to billings growth toward the end of this year, which likely would translate into revenue growth in early 2018. But until that happens, it's hard to expect much in the way of M&A interest.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingWhile FireEye seems confident in its prospects, the price of FEYE stock shows that many observers remain skeptical. The company is shifting from products to clouds, but there's a real concern that it's ""too little, too late,"" with rivals like Fortinet andPalo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) having beaten FireEye to market.Any sale of FEYE is going to depend on that top-line rebound taking place. Lower spend is nice in the near-term, but isn't going to be the primary consideration of a strategic acquirer like IBM or Cisco. A larger company looking to enter the cybersecurity market through a takeout of FireEye stock is going to plan for substantial cost cuts regardless. Whether FEYE makes those cuts in 2017 or IBM does so in 2019 doesn't much change the possibility of a takeover - or the price to be paid for FireEye stock.Simply put, it's revenue that will drive FEYE's attractiveness as an M&A target. Thus, it's revenue that will drive the performance of FireEye stock this year. Sales performance seems to hinge on whether the company succeeds in pivoting away from its legacy appliance business. That puts a lot of pressure on Helix, in particular. The platform may rise to the challenge, to be sure. But any investors expecting a takeout of FEYE stock should at the least, be patient. FireEye has a lot to prove before bigger companies come calling.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Dividend Growth Stocks on Sale TodayThe postCan FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

How FireEye Inc. Burned to the Ground;2/7/2017;"Shares ofFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) plunged 16% on Feb. 3 after the cybersecurity firm   posted a big  fourth quarter sales miss and a weak first   quarter forecast and revealed the departures of key executives.   FireEye's revenue stayed roughly flat year-over-year at $184.7   million, but that represented a big slowdown from its   double-digit growth in previous quarters and missed forecasts by   $6.3 million.Billings fell 14% annually to $221.8 million, which missed the   company's prior forecast of $230 million to $250 million. Gross   margin fell one percentage point annually to 74%, but operating   margin of -1% -- boosted by layoffs and cost cutting measures --   represented a solid improvement from -28% a year earlier. That's   why FireEye's non-GAAP net loss narrowed from $0.36 per share a   year ago to just $0.03 per share, beating estimates by $0.13.Image source: FireEye.makeArticleAd();But looking ahead, FireEye expects its first quarter revenues   to fall 1%-5% annually, which would mark its first year-over-year   decline since its 2013 IPO. Analysts had expected 5% growth. But   on the bottom line, FireEye expects a non-GAAP loss between   $0.26-$0.28 per share, which represents an improvement over its   loss of $0.47 per share a year earlier. Unfortunately, analysts   were expecting a narrower loss of $0.24. To top off all that bad   news, FireEye disclosed that  CFO Mike Berry and Executive   Chairman and former CEO David DeWalt were both leaving the   company.Faced with all these challenges, it isn't surprising that   FireEye trades at just over half its IPO price of $20. Let's   discuss the main headwinds facing FireEye, and why they could   blow the company even further off course this year.How FireEye lost its sparkFireEye provides a threat detection platform that intercepts   attacks before they breach a company's network perimeter. It   serves over  5,000 customers in 67 countries, including   nearly half of the Forbes Global 2000. It was also the first   cybersecurity firm to be certified by the U.S. Department of   Homeland Security back in  2015.FireEye's ""best in breed"" reputation and the rise of data   breaches worldwide fueled its explosive revenue growth over the   past few years, but that growth is decelerating. Its annual   revenue rose  163% in 2014, 46% in  2015, but just 15%   in 2016. That slowdown can mainly be attributed to slower   enterprise spending, tougher competition in the threat detection   market, and a shift away from on-site appliances toward more   scalable cloud-based subscription services.Image source: Getty Images.FireEye is still considered the ""best in breed"" player in   threat detection, but companies likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are now challenging it with bundled threat   detection services. Cisco's acquisitions of SourceFire and    ThreatGRID enhanced its ability to detect threats across   networks powered by its hardware and software. Demand for Cisco's   bundled security solutions notably boosted its cybersecurity   revenues by  13% to nearly $2 billion in fiscal 2016.Microsoft recently launched Windows Defender ATP (Advanced   Threat Protection) for Windows 10, which uses the company's   cloud-based Security Graph (containing data from over 1 billion   Windows devices worldwide) to intercept threats in a similar way.   The tech giant also recently pledge to invest$1 billion annuallyinto its cybersecurity business, which could make it tough for   smaller stand-alone players like FireEye to stay competitive.Widening the moat is a sluggish processFireEye's core turnaround strategy is to pivot away from its   sluggish on-site appliance business and toward FireEye as a   Service (FaaS), a scalable cloud-based platform that continuously   detects and analyzes threats without the need for appliances,   on-site security teams, or managed security services   providers.Last November, FireEye expanded that ecosystem with Cloud MVX   and MVX Smart Grid, which added new private, hybrid, and public   cloud deployment options for mid-sized and larger businesses. It   also launched Helix, an all-in-one platform that bundles its   network, endpoint, Threat Analytics Platform, Advanced Threat   Intelligence, and FireEye Security Orchestrator in a unified   system under  a single user interface.However, turning customers toward that cloud-based platform is   very tough on FireEye's revenue growth, since the company   generates more upfront revenue per appliance sale than   cloud-based subscription. That's why analysts expect its revenue   to rise just 4% in fiscal 2017. FireEye hopes that this growth   will stabilize over time, but its dismal billings growth in the   fourth quarter indicates that it's a tough balancing act to pull   off.The silver liningOn the bright side, CEO Kevin Mandia has reversed FireEye's   widening losses and slowed down its cash burn rate by downsizing   its operations over the past few quarters. The bad news is that   reducing FireEye's sales and marketing spend (down 38% annually   last quarter) could cripple its ability to combat other   competitors and bundled challengers like Cisco and Microsoft.Therefore, I believe that FireEye is in serious trouble, and   that its only real salvation is a buyout. Unfortunately, that   might not happen anytime soon if potential suitors believe that   the company can be bought out at a lower price in the near   future.10 stocks we like better than FireEyeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Can Ubiquiti’s Run Continue in 2017?;2/7/2017;"While many technology investors no doubt enjoyed major gains   in the high-profile large-cap tech names in 2016, mid-cap   wireless companyUbiquiti Networks(NASDAQ: UBNT)  also had itself quite a year, rocketing 125%   in just the past 12 months. The company continues to fly under   the radar, despite having 38-year-old CEO who not only owns the   Memphis Grizzlies but can alsodunk a basketball.Take that, Zuckerberg and Musk!In its most recent quarter ended Sept. 30, revenues grew 35%,   and non-GAAP EPS grew a whopping 55% year over year, largely on   the strength of the Unifi segment. With the recent move in the   stock, investors may be wondering if they've missed the boat, but   I think the momentum can continue in 2017 for the following   reasons.makeArticleAd();IMAGE SOURCE: UBIQUITI NETWORKS, INC.Unifi goes up the value chainAs I mentioned, the star of 2016 for Ubiquiti was Unifi, which   grew 75% in the September quarter. This segment makes low-cost   enterprise hardware products, such as wireless access points,   switches, routers, security cameras, and VOIP phones, along with   software that allows IT professionals to track large networks   from a single user interface. Ubiquiti's low-cost business model   -- the company employs almost no sales force or service   professionals, and hires a limited number of ""all-star"" engineers   -- enables it to produce solid wi-fi products at rock-bottom   prices, and the product line caught fire in 2016. In January,   however, the company unveiled a new line of advanced products   aimed at higher-end customers, which is the turf of IT giants   such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andHP(NYSE: HPE) . The new products included the US-16-XG Switch for   $599 and a new Wave 2 access point for $349. These are much   higher price points than traditional Unifi products, but still   much lower than high-end access point vendors such as   Cisco's Meraki ($1,399), HP's Aruba ($1,395) andBrocade's(NASDAQ: BRCD) Ruckus ($1,295). Should Ubiquiti make inroads   into higher-end deployments, these new products could drive   Ubiquiti's already-sky-high 35% operating margin even higher.Ubiquiti looks as if it is finally making its move to disrupt   legacy IT players, just as prominent venture capitalist (and   former Ubiquiti board member) Bill Gurley predicted in 2014:""The fact that Cisco has never had a price disruptor over 30     years seems to violate the rules of the ""Innovator's Dilemma.""     I think many people believe that a disruption from underneath     is overdue. If I had to bet on anyone pulling that off it would     be [Ubiquiti CEO] Robert [Pera].""Airmax refreshWhile Unifi was the star of 2016, Ubiquiti's biggest segment   is still Service Provider, which accounts for 59% of total   revenues. Under the Airmax and Airfiber brands, this segment   makes high-powered radios that beam Wi-Fi over long distances   while achieving cable-like speeds. These radios are the building   blocks for Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) in rural   and emerging markets worldwide, where fiber or satellite is too   expensive, and the spectrum is less cluttered. Airmax growth had   stalled in the past two years from its hyper-growth period a few   years ago, yet still grew 15% year over year in the September   quarter.There are reasons to think that 2017 could bring a   reacceleration for Airmax and its associated products. First,   Ubiquiti dropped the ball somewhat when it initially released   Airmax AC, as these hyper-fast products were not   backwards-compatible with older Airmax M radios. That meant   service provider customers would have to refresh their entire   networks of radios in order to upgrade, as opposed to upgrading   radio-by-radio. This was fixed in December with the release of   new firmware AirOS 8.0, which was no small task (it took over a   year!). Second, Pera recently revealed several new Airmax   products for 2017, including a GPON fiber product. While   Ubiquiti's radios are normally used to replace fiber, Ubiquiti   found out that many of its emerging-market customers can lay   fiber along power lines very cheaply, and this new product should   add to their arsenals. Even more exciting, the company revealed   an entirely new ASIC (application-specific integrated chip) it   has developed called LTU. As Pera explained:""It's been well over 3 years in the making, and we're going     to launch it next year. And it's going to be essentially     airFiber multipoint. But it's going to be light-years ahead of     anything in the market, and at cost points relevant to airMAX,     we're going to price it higher. The margins are going to be a     lot better... we think that's going to be a really big     differentiator in the market.""Again, we see Ubiquiti making a move to grow out of its   reputation as just a low-cost vendor, and into a company that   sells higher-quality (and, therefore, higher-margin) products as   well.AmplifiWhile Pera & Co. are at it, why not enter a completely new   customer segment? That's what Ubiquiti did this summer with the   introduction of Amplifi, a consumer router that will take onNetgear's(NASDAQ: NTGR) Orbi andGoogle's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) home router. Amplifi is gettingstellar reviewsso far, and just like Unifi's access points, it might pave   the way for other ancillary products for the connected home.Even though the Amplifi was unveiled last summer, it hasn't   produced much revenue for Ubiquiti yet. This is not because the   product wasn't great, but because the company was   capacity-constrained for the last half of 2016. As Pera said:""What I'm really, really, really frustrated about, is we     didn't execute on the production side. So we had demand for     tens of thousands of units out of the gate, and we've just been     slow to get these out.""That is what I'd call having ""champagne problems."" And while   Ubiquiti is going up against strong competitors such as Google,   Netgear, and others, the price-performance characteristics of the   product, as well as the secular tailwind of the connected home   makes me a believer that Amplifi could become a meaningful growth   driver as early as this year.The valuation is still reasonableEven after Ubiquiti's big move, the stock trades at a fairly   reasonable 23 times trailing earnings, which means the market is   pricing in decent, though not spectacular, growth from here.   Still, with a disruptive business model, a rock-solid balance   sheet, and a long runway in a secular growth industry, I think   Ubiquiti's stock can exit 2017 a good deal higher than where it   entered.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy       nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

4 Stocks to Buy for Big February Dividend Hikes;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday, I want to talk to you about my favorite strategy for beating the market and building long-term wealth.makeArticleAd();If you've been reading my regular columns onForbesand ContrarianOutlook.com, you probably already know what it is: buy dividend growth. (I'll name 4 individual stocks that should be on your list now in just a moment.)Becauseas I've written before, stocks that regularly hike their payouts outperform any other kind of company over time. You can give yourself a bigger edge if you invest in companies that surprise the market with bigger-than-expected dividend hikes.TakeCisco Systems, Inc.(CSCO),which ""accelerated"" its quarterly payout last February: after three years of 2 cents per share- and 3 cents per share-a-year increases, Cisco ""went big,"" boosting its dividend by 5 cents per share, or 23.8%.Management declared the new dividend on February 10, 2016; if you'd bought the day before, you'd be up 37% right now:Big Payout Hike Ignites CSCOProblem is, Cisco's sales and earnings are flattening out, and its payout ratio (or the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends) is edging up near 50%.So even if it does drop another outsized hike on investors this month, I don't expect that run to continue.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryBut that's not the case with the fourotherstocks I've got for you today.Sherwin-Williams Co (SHW): The Color of MoneySherwin-Williams Co(SHW)investors can count on a dividend hike in mid-February, when the paint maker typically announces its quarterly payout for the coming year.Sherwin has raised its dividend for 37 straight years, and it's unlikely to break that streak now. Quite the contrary: in the last three years, the payout has jumped 18.8%, on average, and I expectat leastthat again this month.Why? For one, the company just reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that blew past expectations. Management will be keen to draw attention to that, and a fat dividend hike is a great way to do it.They have plenty of room: SHW's payout ratio is minuscule, even with the outsized dividend raises it's been dishing out:A Safe, Growing PayoutYou might think Sherwin's upside is capped by its seemingly high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.2, but that's still below its five-year average of 22.5.And investors are right to expect growth: according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity, US home-reno spending will jump 6.7% this year. With 37% of the paint market-and likely closer to 50% once it closes its merger with rivalThe Valspar Corp(VAL)-Sherwin's perfectly placed to capitalize.Meantime, the all-but-guaranteed dividend hikes will keep driving the stock price higher. Check out how SHW has risen in lockstep with the payout:Dividend Doubles, SHW TriplesThis 151-year-old company currently offers a 1.1% forward dividend yield. The time to buy is now.Lear Corporation (LEA): A Dividend in OverdriveLear Corporation(LEA) may not get your blood pumping on the current yield front - it pays just 0.85% - but itcertainlyshould when it comes to dividend growth. In the past five years, the automotive seat maker's payout has more than doubled. As with Sherwin, that's helped ignite the stock:Another Triple-DoubleLast February, Lear handed out a 20% dividend increase, and I see another double-digit hike coming this year, likely mid-month.Sure, North American car sales have plateaued, but Lear gets 60% of its revenue from outside the continent, and it's forecasting gains in all of its other regions.Car Sales Roll OnSource: Lear Corp.That will help drive Lear's revenue up to $19.5 billion, topping the record $18.6 billion it posted in 2016. And it's sitting on a record order backlog, to boot.The company also has a relatively small number of locations (just 9% of its total) in Mexico, the country that's taken the brunt of President Trump's ire lately. Meantime, Trump's tax and infrastructure proposals could goose job and wage growth in the US-and send more Americans to their local dealership.Above all, Lear is a free-cash-flow machine, cranking out $1.1 billion worth in the last 12 months. Its dividend accounts for a mere 7.1% of that-one of the lowest ratios I've ever seen in a dividend stock.Finally, Lear is cheap, trading at just 9.0 times forward earnings. That, plus management's aggressive buybacks, give you some added downside protection:A Buyback ChampNational Health Investors Inc (NHI): A Long-Term OutperformerNational Health Investors Inc(NHI)is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that finances seniors' housing facilities through mortgage, sale-leaseback, joint-venture and other forms of financing.You won't find Sherwin- or Lear-style double-digit payout growth here. What youwillfind is consistency: NHI's payout has risen for 14 straight years, and those hikes are still healthy, with the dividend growing at 7.7% annualized over the past five years. Plus, the REIT sets you up with an outsized 4.9% forward dividend yield right off the bat.And if you bought NHI a decade ago, you're no doubt happy today. On a total-return basis, the REIT has crushed the benchmarkSPDR S&P 500 ETF(SPY):Built for the Long HaulWhen it comes to REITs, the key figure is funds from operations (FFO), not earnings. And a surge in FFO-as demand for the facilities NHI finances marches higher-has been the driving force behind both the soaring share price and the payout growth.Surging FFO Launches NHI's DividendI fully expect that to continue, thanks to demographics: roughly 10,000 Americans turn 65 every day, and that will fuel soaring demand for senior care in the years ahead. NHI, with a presence in 32 states, stands directly in the way of that trend.Investors, for their part, can look forward to February pay raises for years to come.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe dividend currently represents 73.2% of normalized FFO, a very manageable level for a REIT. NHI is also attractively priced at just 13.3 times trailing-twelve-month normalized FFO. Buy this one and tuck it away for the next 20 years.Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (WYN): Another Yield-and-Growth PlayWyndham Worldwide Corporation(WYN)also offers an above-average yield - 2.5% vs. 2.1%, on average, for theS&P 500- and strong dividend growth: in each of the past three Februarys, WYN has delivered a fat 20% dividend hike. Can it keep up the pace?I wouldn't bet against the hotel chain, because the earnings behind that payout growth keep arcing higher:The company's payout ratio has also held steady at just 28%, despite the fact that it's more than doubled its dividend since 2011.(Wyndham is the world's fifth-largest hotel chain by revenue, with more than 7,900 hotels and 112,000 vacation-rental properties worldwide.)The hotel business is competitive, but WYN's more than holding its own, thanks in part to its popular loyalty program, which lets customers rack up points fast, thanks to the company's huge number of properties.The Street sees more strong earnings growth ahead, with analysts forecasting EPS of $6.25 in 2017. That bodes well for more big payout hikes. Plus WYN is cheap, trading at just 12.7 times this year's EPS forecast. Check into this one now.A Screaming BargainAll 4 of these stocks are great buys now. Problem is, even with their incredible dividend growth, their lower current yields mean they won't be much help if you want to build aretirement portfolio that lets you live on dividends alone.10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print MoneyThat's where my new ""No-Withdrawal"" retirement portfoliocomes in. The 6 bargain-priced investments it's built on deliver safe yields that double up, triple up-and even quadruple up-those of your average S&P 500 stock.These income powerhouses yield a safe 8.0% on average,so a relatively modest $500,000 nest egg would hand you a nice $40,000 yearly income stream!Click here to discover my full strategy and get my 6 best buys for a safe 8.0% average yield now.The post4 Stocks to Buy for Big February Dividend Hikesappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Forget Palo Alto Networks Inc: These 2 Stocks Are Better Buys;2/4/2017;"Image source: Getty.The good news for shareholders ofPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) is that the stock has rebounded following a dismal   2016, jumping 16% in January. The not-so-good news is that wild   stock price fluctuations are par for the course with Palo Alto.   Now, after nearly two years of growing revenue more than 50%,   Palo Alto is seeing its sales growth -- like that of many of its   peers -- slowly coming back down to earth.makeArticleAd();Without the sky-high revenue, investors and some pundits are   taking a closer look at the rest of Palo Alto's financials, and   what they see doesn't paint a pretty picture. However, there are   data-security providers that offer exposure to a market expected   to soar in the coming years and are financially sound, offer   industry diversification, and carry less volatility than Palo   Alto. Two that come to mind as better buys -- though for   different reasons -- areCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) andCheck Point Software(NASDAQ: CHKP) .Image source: Cisco.Security and beyondData security sales are fairly low on the list of revenue   drivers for Cisco today, but that's changing with each successive   quarter. Of its primary units, security was handily Cisco's   fastest-growing business last quarter, and don't be surprised to   see more of the same when it announces fiscal 2017 second-quarter   results on Feb. 15.Cisco's security sales accounted for $540 million of its $12.4   billion in total revenue last quarter, and that's already more   than Palo Alto and Check Point. Security grew 11% compared with a   year ago, and with Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins' strategy of shifting   to burgeoning markets, including cloud data centers and the   Internet of Things, data security will become increasingly   important.That's one of the upsides to Cisco in the security space.   Because Cisco is also leading the charge in other fast-growing   opportunities, it isn't overly reliant on one market. The   introduction of Cisco's new ""Digital Building Switch"" that   delivers ""smart"" functionality to buildings is one recent example   of its diverse offerings. And with a 3.4% dividend yield, Cisco   is a much better buy than Palo Alto for growth and income   investors.Image source: Check Point Software.Slow and steadyWhen Check Point shared its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 19,   its stock jumped about 7% and has maintained those gains since.   That may come as a surprise, given that its revenue climbed only   6%. Palo Alto disappointed last quarter, reporting a 34% sales   improvement. Why the different response? The answer to that   question is why Check Point is a better buy, particularly for   investors who prefer relative stability.Though Check Point's revenue grew 6%, its earnings per share   (EPS) climbed 21% including one-time items. Palo Alto's EPS,   despite its 34% increase in sales to $398.1 million, was a loss   of $0.69 a share, 47% worse than a year ago. Check Point's 26%   increase in its low overhead, recurring subscription revenue of   $110 million, and CEO Gil Shwed's cost-management efforts   translate to a strong bottom line.Check Point was able to report such stellar EPS results   because its total expenses -- both cost of revenue and operating   expenses -- equaled 50% of its $486.7 million in revenue. Palo   Alto spent $50 million more than its total revenue in the   quarter, which is why EPS continues to decline along with its   sales growth.Still a favoriteAnalysts aren't quite as enamored with Palo Alto as they were   a few months ago, though the consensus price target is still   $176.67, equal to nearly 20% appreciation in the near term. One   pundit suggests Palo Alto shares will climb as high as $210.Neither Cisco nor Check Point has earned analysts' good   tidings, at least to the extent Palo Alto has. That said, Cisco's   market diversification, its fast-growing security sales, and an   industry-leading dividend make it a hands-down better buy. And   for a pure-play data-security alternative, Check Point offers a   few things Palo Alto doesn't: increasing profits; a focus on   consistent, sustainable growth; and relative stock price   stability.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Will Cybersecurity ETFs Surge in 2017?;2/3/2017;"Our world is becoming increasingly digital and interconnected, bringing us new opportunities, but also creating enormous challenges. Abundance of digital information and sophisticated tools available to process and share that information make it very hard to ensure data security in this interconnected world. That is why cybersecurity threats and cyberattacks are on the rise.Consequences of hacking can be huge and in most cases, the full extent of damage is almost impossible to be quantified and may not be known for many years. Cybersecurity has been in focus of late due to reports of Russian hacking and Yahoo's massive data breaches. President Trump is expected to issue an executive order on cybersecurity very soon.According to the Cisco Annual Cybersecurity Report released yesterday over one-third of organizations that experienced a breach in 2016 reported substantial customer, opportunity and revenue loss of more than 20%. It isestimatedthat cybercrimes will cost the global economy over $2 trillion by 2019.Since most companies in this space are newer and riskier, it is preferable to look at a couple cybersecurity ETFs for a diversified exposure to this promising space.To learn more about thePureFunds Cyber Security ETF (HACK) and First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR),please watch the short video below:Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?

"Fortinet (FTNT) Beats Q4 Earnings; Issues Robust Outlook";2/3/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Fortinet Inc.FTNTended 2016 on a strong note with better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2017. The company's top- and bottom-line results also reflected year-over-year growth.The network security solution provider's adjusted earnings per share (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) came in at 18 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, the company's adjusted earnings jumped six folds driven mainly by strong top-line growth and better cost management.Fortinet Inc. - Earnings Surprise | FindTheBestRevenuesFortinet reported fourth-quarter revenues of $362.8 million, up 22.4% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $352 million. Segment-wise, Product revenues increased 9.8% year over year to $158.9 million, while Services revenues surged 34.4% to $203.9 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by seasonal demand, improvements in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter also contributed to top-line growth.During the quarter, Fortinet added over 10,000 customers, bringing the total count to over 300,000.The company witnessed 27% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth over $100,000, while the number of deals worth over $250,000 and $500,000 increased 24% and 31%, respectively.Billings were up 22% on a year-over-year basis to $463.4 million.Operating ResultsGross profit increased 26.7% from the year-ago quarter to $271.9 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 74.9%, primarily backed by sales of higher-value subscription bundles.Furthermore, the company has efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating expenses (excluding one-time items but including stock-based compensation) contracted 440 bps year over year to 61.4%. In dollar terms, however, it increased 14.3% to $222.9 million.Adjusted operating profit jumped two and half folds to $49 million from $19.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 660 bps to 13.5% mainly due to improved gross margin and efficient cost management.Adjusted net income jumped over six folds year over year to $31.8 million from the year-ago quarter level of $5.3 million.Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseFortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Fortinet, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowFortinet exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.09 billion, up from $1.03 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $313 million, compared with $239 million at the end of the third quarter.During the quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $101 million. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $84.2 million. In 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $345.7 million and free cash flow of $278.5 million.During the fourth quarter, Fortinet repurchased shares worth $35.8 million, while in the full year, total share buyback under its current authorization was $110.8 million.GuidanceBuoyed by a better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance, Fortinet provided a strong outlook for the first quarter 2017 and the full year.For the first quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $330-$335 million (mid point: $332.5 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share of 15-16 cents (mid point: 15.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $332.08 million and 2 cents, respectively. Billings are expected in the range of $380 million to $388 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 74-75%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 11% and 12%.For 2017, management expects revenues in the range of $1.470-$1.480 billion (mid point: $1.475 billion) and non-GAAP earnings per share of 87-89 cents (mid point: 88 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $1.47 billion and 29 cents, respectively. Billings are expected in the range of $1.750 billion to $1.770 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be 74-75%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated to improve to 16%.Our TakeFortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Despite persistent macro uncertainties, management seems to be positive on the back of a healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans.Furthermore, the company provided an encouraging outlook for the first quarter of 2017and the full year.We believe that the industry has huge growth potential. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead. According to a Markets and Markets report, worldwide cyber security spending will reach $101 billion in 2018 and $170 billion by 2020.Therefore, with its sustained focus on product innovations and strategic acquisitions, we believe that Fortinet is well positioned to capitalize on the huge opportunity available in the space.However, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.CSCO, Check PointCHKP, Juniper NetworksJNPRand Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Even   worse, 13% of these breaches involved credit or debit card   information, and a startling 52% included Social Security   numbers.""The database compromises of 2016 confirmed yet again that   breaches are the third certainty in life and we are all living in   a constant state of cyber-insecurity,"" said CyberScout chairman   and founder Adam Levin. ""Hackers and identity thieves continue to   evolve. They are very sophisticated, extremely creative, and   dogged in their pursuit of what is ours.""In response to this worrisome trend, cybersecurity spending is   forecasted totop $1 trillionover the next five years, according to areportby Cybersecurity Ventures. Fortunately, investors seeking a way   to profit from this megatrend need look no further than thePureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF(NYSEMKT: HACK) .Upon its launch in November 2014, HACK was the first ETF to   track the cybersecurity industry. The fund offers investors   exposure to a portfolio of companies providing cybersecurity   solutions that include hardware, software, and services.Hack is designed to track the ISE Cyber Security Index, which   utilizes a market cap weighted process to determine allocations   across its cybersecurity infrastructure and services categories,   and then equal weights the component stocks within those   categories. The index consists of 34 holdings, with each stock   having a market cap of at least $100 million. Index components   are reviewed and reset quarterly.Top holdings include pure play cybersecurity companies such asCheck Point Software(NASDAQ: CHKP) andPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) , as well as more diversified businesses such as   tech titanCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) .The ETF gives investors the opportunity to profit from the   growth of the cybersecurity industry as a whole, rather than   attempting to identify individual winners -- a difficult endeavor   considering the dynamic nature of the industry in which   disruptive new technologies can alter the competitive landscape   seemingly overnight. HACK also offers investors a chance to   benefit fromindustry consolidation, without having to speculate as to which companies will be   acquired.All told, cyberattacks pose what is perhapsthe biggest threatto the U.S. economy in 2017, according to the World Economic   Forum.

3 Tech Stocks Paying Better Dividends Than Apple;2/2/2017;"Technology stocks, once the domain of high-flying growth investors, are becoming an increasingly generous source of dividends for income investors. The information technology sector led the market by total dividends paid both for the third quarter of 2016 and for the 12 months that ended September 30, according to a FactSet analysis of the 419 dividend payers in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple (symbolAAPL) was tops in the IT sector, paying $12.2 billion in dividends over the 12-month stretch.But just because Apple handed out the most money to its shareholders doesn't mean it's the best source of income in the sector. In fact, Apple's stock currently yields just 1.8%, even less than the S&P 500's 2.1%. So we set out to find mature tech stocks with solid business outlooks that offer superior yields to Apple. Our search turned up three blue-chip names. How blue? Like Apple, all three of our picks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Take a look.makeArticleAd();Cisco SystemsCisco Systems, which makes the routers, switches and modems that form the backbone of the internet, is poised for better-than-expected sales growth, analysts say. A recent survey of its customers by UBS Securities revealed that spending on Cisco products remains a top budgetary priority. The tech company gets good marks for being easy to work with, and two-thirds of respondents said it has the best overall security offering. The growth of cloud-based computing (storing data and applications on remote servers) and the Internet of Things (the expanding digital interconnectivity of everyday items, from cars to refrigerators) are long-term tailwinds for the company and the stock. UBS has a ""buy"" rating on Cisco shares.Analysts, on average, expect Cisco's earnings to rise by just a penny this fiscal year ending July 30, to $2.37 from $2.36, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Sales are forecast to slip 1.9% in fiscal 2017. The more bullish case for Cisco stems from projections for the following fiscal year (ending in July 2018), when profits are projected to climb 5% to $2.49 a share, and revenue is expected to gain 2.4%.Cisco's dividend, which dates back to 2011, has increased annually. The company disbursed $5 billion in common dividends for the 12 months ended Oct. 31. That was supported by $12 billion in free cash flow, or cash left over after spending the money required to operate and expand the business.SEE ALSO:10 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnIntelConsumers are increasingly forgoing desktop computers for mobile devices. As a result, PC sales have become a slowly melting iceberg. Market research firm Gartner found that PC sales fell for eight consecutive quarters as of the third quarter of 2016. That has forced Intel, the world's largest maker of the central processing units that serve as a PC's brain, to find new ways to generate revenue growth.The expansion of cloud-based services has been a boon to Intel, thanks to its market-share dominance in server chips. True, Intel faces changes in customer demands and competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but analysts at Stifel say it's responding well. ""Intel has been acquiring technologies and recruiting outside managerial talent to prepare for the changing market,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy, who rates Intel shares a ""buy,"" said in a recent note to clients.Analysts expect 2017 earnings to rise to $2.79 from $2.72 a share in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue is forecast to increase 1% to $60.1 billion. Intel paid its first cash dividend in 1992, and the company resumed annual dividend hikes two years ago. Intel's payout ratio, or dividends as a percentage of earnings, is a conservative 37% and below even the S&P 500's average ratio of 40%.SEE ALSO:3 Reasons to Own Apple Stock in RetirementMicrosoftMicrosoft is another tech company that's benefiting from the rise in cloud computing. An increasing number of customers now pay a recurring subscription fee to use its software rather than purchasing it outright. It's proving to be a hot area of growth. ""The closely watched commercial cloud business -- which includes Office 365, Azure and Dynamics 365 -- continued to grow at a torrid rate, reaching over $14.0 billion in annualized revenue in the second quarter [which ended December 31, 2016],"" William Blair & Co. analyst Jason Ader said in a recent note to clients.Importantly, the analyst expects Microsoft to become more profitable over time because of its ""disproportionate growth in its commercial cloud business, which is being boosted by rapid customer adoption of Office 365 and Azure."" Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, and Office 365 is the subscription version of its popular Office applications. Cloud-based services can have higher profit margins than traditional licensed software.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project earnings to rise to $2.97 a share for the current fiscal year ending June 30, from $2.79 in fiscal 2016. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is expected to increase 4.9% year over year, to $96.5 billion. For its second quarter, which ended December 31, Microsoft generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow after disbursing $3 billion worth of dividends. The company has paid a dividend to its shareholders since 2003. By contrast, Apple resumed paying a regular quarterly dividend only in 2012, following a 17-year layoff.SEE ALSO:10 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks for 2017"

5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith President Donald Trump into his first month in office, it's time for investors to focus on how to navigate what likely will be a bumpy investing road - certainly this year, but potentially for years to come.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Steve Buissinne via Stock SnapIndeed, possible changes to Wall Street rules and regulations (including Glass-Steagall), re-negotiations of trade agreements (including the long-established NAFTA pact, oroutright cancellationof newer agreements like TPP) and an America-focused trade policy will shape the way investors peer into their investment crystal balls.What always will matter for investors - particularly those planning for retirement - is building a portfolio that includes no-brainer dividend stocks that can stand the ups and downs of the markets.Picking winners and losers for the next few months will be fraught with uncertainty. My advice? Focus on things like balance sheets, cash flows, dividend hike histories and diversification. That'll provide you with a solid base for the future.As a note: These dividend stocks don't come with screamingly high yields, and instead sit around the 3%-4% area. That's because what we're looking for here is good dividend yield, but excellent dividend quality. Plus, in most of these cases, there's room for dividend growth, which will improve your yield on cost over time.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryHere's a look at five safe dividend stocks that fit our retirement needs:Safe Dividend Stocks for Retirement: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: ShutterstockCSCO Dividend Yield:3.5%Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) continues to be virtually eponymous with routers, switches, and integrated networks.The problem is, those businesses are waning.Cisco didn't have a smooth recovery coming out of the financial crisis, though management did manage to right the ship starting around 2012. That said, revenues have been mostly flat thanks to its aging legacy businesses.Nonetheless, Cisco is primed for strong growth thanks to moves well beyond its roots,including in the internet of things.Cisco's dividend is relatively fresh, having started in 2011 at 6 cents per share. Now, the dividend stands more than quadruple that at 26 cents, good for a yield well north of 3%. And given that CSCO still pays out less than half its profits in earnings, you can expect Cisco to keep hiking its dividend - albeit, maybe notasaggressively as it has in the past half-decade.Also reassuring is just under $70 billion in cash and short-term investments, which it can use to make deals like its recent$3.7 billion buyout of AppDynamics.Cisco's flat revenues aren't reassuring, but earnings are expected to grow this year and next, and Wall Street even expects a modest 2% uptick in revenues next year, so that's something.Also, CSCO trades at just 12.3 times forward earnings. That's just less thanInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), and a couple points underOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL). And both of those dividend stocks don't have Cisco matched for yield right now.Safe Dividend Stocks for Retirement: Consolidated Edison (ED)Source:WikimediaED Dividend Yield:3.8%Well, if nothing else,Consolidated Edison, Inc.(NYSE:ED) gets my mom's stamp of approval: She has owned the dividend stock in her retirement portfolio since 1980.ConEd primarily serves New York City and most of its northern suburbs, and has been around since 1832. Today it delivers gas, electric and steam service (think radiators) to more than 10 million customers, generating nearly $13 billion in revenue for 2016.New York and its suburbs continue to grow in population, housing starts are up, NYC is still home to a multitude of corporate headquarters locations, and tourists still flock to the Big Apple in droves. But ConEd isn't simply resting on what the New York area has to offer.To start, ConEd is working to find ways to produce cleaner energy that costs less for it to produce, like acustomer-centric program in Brooklyn and Queensthat's helping to provide customers with incentives to lower costs instead of needing to build a $1 billion substation. ConEd is also building out anAdvanced Metering Infrastructure program- a smart meter technology that will help identify local power generation problems and possible power outages more quickly for customers, allowing ConEd to administer services more quickly.What ConEd lacks in size - for comparison,Duke Energy Corp(NYSE:DUK) runs at about $23bb per year - it makes up for in steady net income of just over $1 billion per year over the past few years, and grown profits for the past three years. Steadier still is ED's operating cash flow of over $3 billion - a tidy sum considering its $12 billion in revenue.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsED's payout ratio is nearly 65%, but for a utility company, that's not terribly high.Southern Co(NYSE:SO) and Duke Energy clock in above 80%. So ConEd has a bit more room to improve its dividends. Indeed, Consolidated Edison has increased earnings for 42 consecutive years, including a 3% hike recently to 69 cents quarterly.Safe Dividend Stocks for Retirement: Lockheed Martin (LMT)Source:Praveer Sharma via FlickrDividend Yield:2.9%Defense is one of President Trump's biggest areas of focus, andLockheed Martin Corporation(NYSE:LMT) is … well, it's a solid bet for the years ahead, despite what the headlines might indicate.This global aerospace and security giant operates within five segments, including Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Mission Systems and Training (MST) and Space Systems. Lockheed's diversity of product offerings and industries provides the ability to weather some difficult times.With programs that run the gamut fromhelicopter and fighter jetsto advancedmaterial manufacturing, Lockheed's $46 billion business model is set to cushion the possible blow of lowering the price of its signature F-35 jet after President Trump jaw-boned CEO Marillyn Hewson onthe cost of the program. At $379 million, the F-15 is roughly 20% of LMT's revenue.But that's not the only program in the Lockheed portfolio, and Lockheed is far from a company hoping to hold on to the past and hope for the future. Its most recent blockbuster move was the purchase ofUnited Technologies(NYSE:UTX) Sikorsky Helicopter division in 2015 - a move once thought foolish but that haspanned outbig-time for LMT.LMT is also knee-deep in one of the biggest growth sectors in the tech sector: cybersecurity. Lockheed technology is everywhere, from building firewalls for commercial users to national security.On the dividend front, LMT has raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years, and those haven't been meager upticks. Lockheed's quarterly payout has grown 82% in just the past five years alone.If President Trump is indeed on the side of the defense industry in his quest to restore American military power abroad, Lockheed Martin is going to sit in the front row of procurement.Safe Dividend Stocks for Retirement: PepsiCo (PEP)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield:2.9%If President Trump's policies do indeed break the economy wide open for growth, consumer products giantPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP) is among the dividend stocks that will be on the front lines of prosperity.PepsiCo management's decision to expand its branding footprint well beyond it eponymous ""Pepsi"" soda lineup over the years has helped smooth over difficult times for the industry. In fact, Pepsi is more than beverages, also boasting a massive snack line that has taken some of the sting out of the weakening popularity of sugary beverages.Buried within each of PepsiCo's six divisions are brand names that will stand the long-game test of time:  Aquafina water, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana and Ocean Spray juice products, Aunt Jemima pancakes, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Cheetos, Cracker Jack, Diet Pepsi, and Diet Sierra Mist are among the standouts.PepsiCo isn't afraid to spend, either - PEP poured out $4 billion on advertising and $700 million on R&D in 2015 - so its brands should continue to saturate both the markets and consumers' brains with each commercial or product promotion.PepsiCo isn't among the highest-yielding dividend stocks for retirement. Instead, it's a dual play on both price appreciation and dividend growth.Indeed, PepsiCo's 2016 dividend hike to 75 cents per share (quarterly) was its 44th consecutive annual raise. Free cash flow was just under $8 billion last year, plus Pepsi has about $15 billion in cash and short-term investments, so financially, PEP is bulletproof.

Both in and of themselves also intersect, which brings us to the key point behind JNJ's longevity, strength, and investment selling point: its Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices divisions.Pharmaceuticals and Medical combine to make up just more than 80% of total revenues, so clearly, healthcare is the biggest driver of JNJ. But having essentially 20% exposure to consumer products buffers Johnson & Johnson from significant economic or sector downturns, including arecent turndownin the medical sector.A key to JNJ's longevity, and that of any pharm stock of course, is its pipeline of future medicines and drugs. Here, the company has several late-stage trial drugs, which includes additional indications for already-approved myleoma treatment Imbruvica and heart treatment Xarelto.Johnson & Johnson's biggest claim to dividend fame, of course, is its standing as a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its payout for 54 consecutive years, including a 6.7% bump in 2016.Free cash flow has been steadily on the rise, including just less than $16 billion in FCF in 2015. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson just used $30 billion in cash to buy up Switzerland-basedActelion Ltd, a maker of products for pulmonary arterial hypertension … which means it still has a decent war chest of about $10 billion remaining.JNJ trades about the same as the broader S&P 500, and offers long-term stability and income.

Will Microsoft's $1 Billion Cybersecurity Play Hurt Smaller Players?;2/1/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently announced that  it will invest over   $1 billion per year on cybersecurity research and development.   That amount, which is equivalent to roughly 8% of its R&D   spend over the past 12 months, doesn't include any acquisitions   that Microsoft might make. Let's see why Microsoft is beefing up   its cybersecurity efforts, and what that could mean for smaller   players across the fragmented industry.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();What cybersecurity means to MicrosoftMicrosoft's Windows is the most widely used PC operating   system in the world, Office is the  most popular   productivity suite, and Azure is the second largest cloud   platform in the world afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS. Much of this massive ecosystem has   traditionally been protected by third party companies.   Microsoft's own products -- like Windows Firewall, Windows   Defender, and Microsoft Security Essentials -- were  often   considered inferior to third-party ones.However, Microsoft's ecosystem has become more cohesive under   CEO Satya Nadella's ""One Windows"" strategy, which aims to install   the same OS and app store across multiple platforms. Since users   would ideally download apps from the Windows Store and deliver   their data to Cortana and Bing via Azure, it would be logical to   add first-party, self-updating security solutions across the   entire ecosystem. Microsoft claims that the number of weekly   cyber attacks has risen from 20,000 to as many as 700,000 over   the past two to three years.To counter those threats while expanding its ecosystem,   Microsoft acquired three Israeli cybersecurity firms over the   past two years -- enterprise security start-up Aorato, cloud   security firm Adallom, and data protection firmSecure Islands. Those acquisitions and its planned R&D investments could   help Azure challenge AWS, which already integrates an    arsenal of security features into its cloud infrastructure   platform. Azure's revenue surged 93% annually last quarter, but   Microsoft hasn't revealed its exact sales figures yet.How this could hurt smaller playersAs Microsoft's cybersecurity ecosystem grows, it could overlap   with the services of many smaller stand-alone third-party   players. For example, Microsoft recently  launched Windows   Defender ATP (Advanced Threat Protection) for Windows 10. That   endpoint service matches events with Microsoft's cloud-based   Security Graph, which gathers data across over a billion Windows   devices worldwide. It also works with Microsoft's email   protection services from Office 365 and Microsoft Advanced Threat   Analytics.This platform directly competes against ""perimeter"" players   like threat prevention firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) and next-gen firewall vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) . During last year's RSA Conference, Microsoft   principal research lead Tanmay Ganacharya toldDark Readingthat Windows Defender ATP can ""help capture network traffic out   of a given endpoint"", so that it could ""detect the same attacks""   as FireEye and other threat detection services.Consider what $1 billion means to these smaller cybersecurity   companies. Palo Alto and FireEye are expected to respectively   generate $1.8 billion and $720 million in revenues this year --   so there's no way that they could match Microsoft's R&D   investments. Windows, Office 365, Azure, Dynamics, and other   platforms all give Microsoft the ability to bundle and scale up   its cybersecurity services very quickly. It can also offer lower   prices and offset those losses across other parts of its   ecosystem.But ""best in breed"" cybersecurity firms could still     surviveMicrosoft's growing interest in the cybersecurity market could   render some smaller players obsolete, but ""best in breed"" players   like FireEye and Palo Alto have survived similar assaults from   bundled players before.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , for example, has aggressively bundled threat   prevention and next-gen firewalls into its networking hardware   and software. Yet FireEye still serves 5,000 customers across 67   countries, which includes nearly half of the Forbes Global 2000.   Palo Alto serves over 35,500 customers in more than  140   countries, including 80 of the Fortune 100 and half of the Global   2000.Those numbers indicate that companies will likely value a   company's track record and reputation over the convenience of   cheaper bundles. They also indicate that it could be smarter for   Microsoft to either acquire or partner with smaller stand-alone   players instead of trying to render them obsolete.The key takeawayBeefing up its cybersecurity business will help Microsoft   counter Amazon and tighten up its ""One Windows"" ecosystem. While   some of the new features seem destined to crush third-party   security players, investors should remember that companies will   likely stick with ""best in breed"" players instead of the cheapest   bundle, and a mass switch to a new security platform can be   costly and time consuming.Therefore, investors in cybersecurity companies should be   mindful of Microsoft's ambitions, but they should remember that   many ""best in breed"" companies have weathered similar attacks   from companies like Cisco before.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat, Increase Y/Y;2/1/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Shares ofApple Inc.AAPLwere up over 3% in aftermarket trading following better-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results.Earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.Product DetailsThe good show was driven by impressive sales of Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Performance of Apple's Services business was also impressive.Total iPhone unit sales came in at about 78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue).Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year (with extra one week in the quarter) to nearly $7.2 billion. App Store sales in December alone topped $3 billion. Apple said that it expects Services ""revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year.""Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. QuoteManagement also noted that Apple Pay reported transaction volume growth of 500%, buoyed by expansion to markets like Spain, Japan, Russia and New Zealand. At present Apple Pay is available in 13 markets.Apple Mac unit sales were up 1% year over year to approximately 5.4 million, while revenues grew 7% from the prior-year quarter to $7.2 billion.Coming to iPad, Apple sold 13.1 million units in the quarter, down 19% year over year. Revenues of $5.5 billion were down 22% from the prior year quarter.Other products, which include revenues from Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, declined 8% year over year to over $4 billion. Again, there were no data available on Apple Watch sales or its latest product launch, AirPods.Geographical PerformanceDemand for Apple's products improved across most of the geographical regions except greater China. As much as 64% of sales were from the International markets.Americas (the biggest market for Apple) generated revenues of approximately $32 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year.Europe generated nearly $18.5 billion in revenues, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues from Japan rose 20% year over year to $5.8 billion while the rest of Asia Pacific generated revenues of $5.8 billion, up 8% year over year.Owing to persistent macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around 12% year over year in the Greater China region to $16.2 billion.MarginsGross margin was 38.5%, a decline of 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses increased 9% year over year to $6.8 billion due to higher research & development expenses as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, operating margin plunged 210 bps from the year-ago quarter to 29.8%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowApple's cash and cash equivalents (and short-term marketable securities) were $60.5 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $67.2 billion at fiscal 2016-end. Long-term debt was $73.6 billion compared with $75.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2016.For the quarter, cash generated from operating activities was $27.1 billion.Apple returned about $15 billion in capital returns this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Apple also said that it has so far returned $201 billion out of the $250 billion capital returns program announced in April last year.The company also declared its quarterly dividend of 57 cents per share payable on Feb 16 to shareholders of record as on Feb13.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 39%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.Our TakeBetter-than-expected iPhone sales have definitely come as a respite. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the high-growth regions for Apple. Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone's growth in China.Nonetheless, Apple is optimistic about long-term growth prospects in regions like China and India. In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal.Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices. Also, in the long run, Apple is expected to benefit from its robust cash position, strength in technology and the ecosystem that it has built, given its loyal customer base. Further, its enterprise collaborations with the likes of Deloitte, IBM Corp.IBM, CiscoCSCOand SAP SESAPare expected to be important long-term growth drivers.Currently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Why Shares of Cisco Systems Rose 11% in 2016;1/31/2017;"Image source: Cisco Systems.What happenedShares of networking hardware giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) jumped 11.3% in 2016, according to data provided   byS&P Global Market Intelligence. While revenue declined slightly in each of the past four   quarters, Cisco has put together a long streak of beating analyst   estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock rose slightly   more than theS&P 500index last year, driven by these earnings beats.makeArticleAd();So whatWhile Cisco reported year-over-year revenue declines in each   of its four quarterly reports in 2016, the sale of the SP Video   CPE business was the main culprit. Adjusting for this   divestiture, Cisco managed to grow revenue by between 1% and 3%   each quarter. This was enough to beat analyst estimates for   revenue in all cases.About 45% of Cisco's revenue comes from its core switching and   routing segments, which are no longer consistently growing, with   the rest coming from faster-growing segments like security and   collaboration. While switching revenue was flat in fiscal 2016   and routing revenue slumped 4%, collaboration and security   revenue rose by 9% and 13%, respectively. This growth helped   balance out weakness in the core business.CSCOdata byYCharts.Cisco also beat analyst estimates for earnings each quarter,   with profitability holding up better than revenue. Share buybacks   helped, with the company spending nearly $4 billion in fiscal   2016 buying back its own shares. Cisco does expect a decline in   revenue and earnings during the second fiscal quarter of 2017.   That guidance sent the stock lower during the last few months of   last year.Now whatSome of Cisco's growth businesses performed poorly during the   last reported quarter. Collaboration and data center revenue each   fell by 3% year over year. Security remained strong, growing by   11%, but Cisco's guidance suggests that this wasn't an   anomaly.Cisco has made plenty of acquisitions as it aims to diversify   away from hardware. The biggest in quite a while, the$3.7 billion purchase of software provider   AppDynamics, was announced in January 2017. Cisco is paying a steep price,   and I'm a little concerned that the company is becoming   undisciplined when it comes to splurging for start-ups.   Acquisitions are important for Cisco, but dramatically overpaying   will do more harm than good.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheDow Jones Industrial Averagehas long been sold to investors as one of the best, safest places to put your money. Dow dividend stocks, as a result, have been a buy-and-hold safe haven for decades.makeArticleAd();Source: StockSnap.ioDividends - those sweet regular payments that companies make to shareholders - mean vital income for many older investors.Safety and dividend yield were what Charles Dow was looking for when he crafted his first list of 12 industrial stocks on May 28, 1896, for his and Edward Jones'Wall Street Journal. One company -General Electric Company(NYSE:GE) - remains from that original group. The others were broken up by the government, turned into divisions of other firms or (likeNational Lead) just sank out of sight.Today's list is heavy on technology but also includes oil companies, retailers, tech companies and financials. In my 30 years as a self-directed retirement investor, I have owned a dozen of them at one time or another.As we age, our investing goals change. At 62, I'll soon be less interested in growth, more interested in income to take me through my retirement. That's where Dow dividend stocks shine.For those on the hunt for income, we'll examine the top 10 Dow Jones Industrial Average components by yield as we head into February. Every stock on here yields at least 3.2% - not too shabby in a world where the 30-year U.S. bond is still yielding just 3.03%.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatBut important to note is that while all of these stocks are good yielders, not all of them are winners. This look at the Dow 30's highest-yielding dividend stocks is meant to help you separate the wheat from the chaff.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #10, Caterpillar (CAT)Source:Anthony via FlickrCAT Dividend Yield:3.2%Caterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT), the Peoria, Ill.-based maker of heavy equipment, has been shrinking since 2012, because much of its equipment is sold for moving coal and other resources out of the ground and to the market.Caterpillar is heavily tied to agriculture, and farm income has also been falling since 2012. Oversupply means lower income, and many farmers can't pay their debts - much of which were taken out to buy Caterpillar equipment. On a trip to the Midwest last summer, I saw corn that was literally as high as an elephant's eye, but I saw very few happy farmers.That may change this year.Prices on corn futures have been risingand corn prices should be at $4 per bushel early next year. In anticipation of better days, CAT stock is up 40% over the last year. This comes on top of a 77-cent quarterly dividend that currently yields a little more than 3%.Most analysts have Caterpillar rated only as a hold, estimating earnings for 2017 at $3.26 per share - not enough to cover that dividend.I have not added CAT to my portfolio, but that doesn't mean I'm not optimistic about this Dow stock. Caterpillar still has positive operating cash flow. Management has held the line on debt, even while asset values have gone down. Belts have been tightened, and better business anywhere -as from a big Trump infrastructure plan- would fall mostly to the bottom line.Caterpillar's $2-per-share loss last week on revenues of $9.6 billion sent shares down a bit, as many investors see this as the bottom for the current cycle.CAT is leveraged to profit from growth. I see the price as rich here - the stock has been on fire since the election - but a realistic price in the low $90s could be a buying opportunity.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #9, IBM (IBM)Source: ShutterstockIBM Dividend Yield:3.2%I am known aroundInvestorPlaceas a hater ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), but I have not always hated the company. I owned it early in this decade, seeing a nice dividend and a share price that by 2012 was pushing $200 per share.Now, among Dow dividend stocks, IBM is a loser.IBM reported its full-year results on Jan. 19, and fourth-quarter revenues of $21.77 billion were indeed more than the previous quarter's $19.23 billion. But don't be fooled. During the previous quarter, the company had revenue of $22.06 billion, and it delivered over $250 million more net income during that quarter than in 2016, too.For all the brave talk about Watson - the artificial intelligence software IBM has been using in ads the way it used Charlie Chaplin in the 1980s - much of its profit still comes from mainframes. Mainframes are dying. A lot of its software serves mainframes and corporate networks. Corporate networks are being replaced by IP networks.As in the past, IBM has been trying to buy its way out of trouble, buyingTruven HealthAnalyticsa year ago, for $2.6 billion, aSalesforce.com Inc.(NYSE:CRM) integrator calledBlue Wolffor $200 million, and some other pieces in cloud security and recovery - areas that are growing.But the boat continues to open new leaks. In recent years, IBM was forced to literally give away its chip-making business, payingGlobal Foundries$1.5 billion to take it off its hands. Businesses likeRational Software, bought in 2003 for $2.1 billion, are being sold in pieces because they no longer make sense. IBM is out of PCs, out of mini-computers, out of printers, even out of what used to be cash registers.IBM is like a beautiful old house with a huge mortgage whose owners are selling the china and silver to pay for their healthcare. They may look good at the club, in their tennis whites, butbehind the curtain, it's Grey Gardens.IBM has growing debts, declining profits and an ossified corporate culture where selling and marketing mean more than creating technology breakthroughs and solving real problems.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsI don't care ifWarren Buffett still loves IBM. I don't. I'm afraid I never will again.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #8, General Electric (GE)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)GE Dividend Yield:3.3%Charlie Dow knew a good long-term play when he saw one.General Electric Company(NYSE:GE)has the longest tenure among Dow dividend stocks, 121 years on.Dow might even recognize Jeff Immelt's GE. So might Charles Coffin, who was president of the General Electric Co. in 1896. GE today, as in 1896, is mostly in the power business. It makes engines and generators. It also makes products that bring fuel to the surface, and last November bid to take over most ofBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI).GE is up 8% over the year and sports a 3%-plus dividend, which means a total return of about 11%.Almost half the analysts following it say to buy, and the average rating is ""overweight."" They expect earnings of $1.69 per share this year - plenty to cover the 98-cent annual dividend, which rose by a penny late last year.As I recently wrote, GE is a company thatover-promises and under-delivers.It isn't going to fail, but it isn't going to boom, either.It may do well if oil booms again, but under Immelt, GE has become aWaiting for Godotstock … and in the play, Godot never showed up.I owned GE for most of this decade, and enjoyed a decent return, but I see a limited horizon for the oil and gas business - higher prices will just bring more supply, driving prices back down again. Add to that the fact that renewable energy supplies, especially efficiency, are increasing and getting cheaper.Yes, it makes wind turbines and it's all over efficiency, but I'm not feeling the return there.Sorry, Charlie.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #7, Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: ShutterstockCSCO Dividend Yield:3.4%For one brief shining moment in the year 2000,Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) was the world's most valuable company. Their Internet switches and routers connected the world, and the ceiling for growth seemed unlimited.This was back when my kids were in grade school and I rocked a red beard, with a fedora. Good times.Today, CSCO is a solid dividend stock. The 26-cent quarterly dividend yields 3.4%. It's a little like me: a distinguished white-haired gentleman. If you bought it when it made that turn in 2011, at $15, its 6-cent payout has more than quadrupled, and you have an annual yield of 6% on that investment. Cisco can afford the dividend, too, as it usually earns about twice its payout.But there is danger in the air.Hardware is becoming software. The function of a switch or a writer can be done by any PC with ports and the write software. The trend is called Software Defined Networking. Cisco is thus rushing to become a software company, buyingAppDynamicsfor $3.7 billion, becoming a force in computer security, and raising the percentage of revenue from software to 29%.Analysts are divided between those who tell people to buy Cisco, and those who just want you to hold it. I once owned this stock, and I am not divided. I say avoid it. If you're to buy into technology, you need to get in on the leading edge, and switches are no longer the leading edge.Technology evolves rapidly. When a technology company ceases to be on that leading edge, it starts to die. This can happen very quickly, asNokia Corp. (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) discovered with the debut of the iPhone 10 years ago. And there may be nothing that can be done, as Novell learned when the internet replaced its networking system. Also, the industry seldom allows for second acts.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for RetirementI do not envy the job of Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, who succeeded the legendary John Chambers in 2015. Selling any kind of hardware in a cloud-based era is a very difficult thing to do, and margins will remain compressed.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #6, Coca-Cola (KO)Source:Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)KO Dividend Yield:3.4%I admit to a bias on behalf ofThe Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO).I was raised on Coke on Long Island. I never liked Pepsi. (Pro tip: The secret ingredient is vanilla.)I moved to Atlanta in 1981, and Coca-Cola built Atlanta. There is no other reason for a city to be here, save the sugar water that Robert Woodruff took around the world. Woodruff convinced corporations to put regional offices here, his boyhood friend Bill Hartsfield (of the airport) helped make the city an island of relative peace during the Civil Rights era, and as ""Mr. Anonymous"" he contributed much of the civic infrastructure, like the Arts Center and most of the Emory University campus, which drives Atlanta today.Oh, did you ever wonder why Santa Claus wears a red coat?That's Coca-Cola red.I have owned Coca-Cola stock in the past. I got out because it's just not growing - revenues are down 10% since 2012, and operating margins have been declining. Don't let anyone fool you about what they make, either. It's not so much sugared water as it is treated water. Mr. Woodruff said in 1923 to make every Coca-Cola (we call it Co-Cola down here) taste like every other Coca-Cola, no matter where you bought it, and that made the company an early leader in water treatment. If you don't trust the water on your travels, buy a Coke. It won't hurt you.That said, there may finally be a reason to buy Coke stock again, and his name is James Quincey.Quincey becomes CEO on May 1and is already credited with growing profits through smaller cans and buying new brands likeJugo de Valle, a Mexican juice producer.Coke now has 20 brands with over $1 billion in sales, including Dasani water, Odwalla juices and Honest Tea. If you buy a can of hot coffee from a vending machine in Japan, it's probablyGeorgia, another Coke product.Coca-Cola delivers a steady $10 billion in operating cash flow each year, and continues to cover its 35-cent quarterly dividend with earnings. A 10% price decline since April has goosed the yield a bit - and you want to buy a dividend stock when the price is down, like now, but when there is a little bit of excitement around it, like now.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #5,Boeing (BA)Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrBA Dividend Yield:3.5%I am a former shareholder ofBoeing Co(NYSE:BA), having sold out last spring at about $130 per share.This was a mistake, as Boeing shares are now worth $169 - one-third more than they were when I sold. Even at that price, however, the recently announced $1.42-per-share dividend sports a yield of 3.5%. Boeing delivered $10.5 billion in operating cash flow during the fourth quarter, and forecast 2017 earnings of $9.10 to $9.30 per share, meaning that new dividend should be safe.Since orders for new planes peaked in 2014, Boeing has been focused on productivity and cost-cutting, moving production from Puget Sound, where the company is headquartered, to Charleston, South Carolina, which for now is not unionized.But aftera failed attemptto move production offshore early in the decade, I questioned just how much more costs could be driven out of plane production, which is why I foolishly sold.Boeing is increasing its delivery of aircraft in 2017 and plans to get into the space business in 2018. If it can pick up more military contracts, the stock could be worth its current price, which has reached analyst targets and thus could be subject to profit-taking.If profits are taken and the price falls, however, jump in. Profit-taking will be limited by the increased dividend, whose yield puts a floor under that price.In short, Boeing truly is among the ""top"" Dow dividend stocks, in that it makes more than enough to cover what it pays out, and it has good enough prospects to be worth holding for years to come.The 7 Best REITs to Buy for High Yield AND GrowthEverybody goofs at some point.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #4, Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)XOM Dividend Yield:3.6%No Dow stock was as ready for Trump asExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), whose CEO Rex Tillerson is close to being confirmed as Secretary of State.Exxon rose sharply after the election, by more than 10% in about a month. But it has since given up most of those gains, helping expand its yield to 3.6%. The question is whether that dividend can be sustained into the future. Exxon hasn't brought in more than 75 cents per share in net income since the end of 2015, and that was not expected to changewhen it reported earnings on Jan. 31.The street's ""whisper number"" of 68 cents per share - what analysts are supposedly telling each other what to expect - is below the consensus earnings estimate of 72 cents.The bull case for Exxon has always been based on its balance sheet. The company has nearly $340 billion in assets, and the $46 billion in debt it had against those assets in October was among the lowest figures in the industry. Tillerson managed Exxon Mobil conservatively during the oil bust, which turned out to be a wise move as operating cash flow deteriorated sharply through the first quarter of 2016.Exxon Mobil is called an ""integrated international"" oil company, with production assets around the world, along with refineries, tankers, and gas stations. This let it squeeze out margins even when oil prices were at their lowest, through refining, trading and running gas stations.The company is hedging its bets on international growth, buying oil assets in Texas' Permian Basin for $5.6 billion up-front and as much asanother $1 billion over the next few years. It's also hedging its bets on the climate, appointing environmental scientist Dr. Susan Avery to its board of directors - a move Tillerson would have been unlikely to make and one that shocked some Trump allies. The fact is XOM now has allies in Washington to fight its political battles, and it can expect good news on that front for some time to come.In the near-term, this makes Exxon Mobil stock a buy and, for income investors, a bargain.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #3,Chevron (CVX)Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)CVX Dividend Yield:3.9%Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) is the anti-Exxon. More precisely, Chevron is everything Exxon Mobil is accused of being, and a little bit more.Chevron is a more aggressive polluter - and a more aggressive litigant against paying for pollution - than Exxon Mobil. Chevron is also less committed to downstream retail, thus more dependent on crude prices, than Exxon Mobil.CVX also is a bit more generous, with its dividend near 4% to current buyers. But should you be one?Personally, I don't think so. Chevron lost money for three of the last four quarters, making that dividend harder to justify. Its debt-to-assets ratio has been rising faster than Exxon Mobil's, and until the September quarter, its operating cash flow had been falling steadily.Things are getting worse for Chevron, even while they seem to be getting better for Exxon Mobil. CVX missed badly on optimistic estimates for its December quarter, with a profit of 22 cents per share on revenue of $31.5 billion. Analysts had been expecting a 65-cent profit. That's not a miss … that's a mile.Bulls expect Chevron to score big profits from a return to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. I do not.Going back to Q4 earnings, note that revenues did beat. But profits were down because profits from refining fell 65% year-over-year, to $357 million. If the Gulf doesn't yield big profits, if oil prices don't stay high, or if there's an accident, that dividend - which was hiked a penny last fall to $1.08 per share - will be at serious risk.Income investors can't just look at yield. They need to look at earnings as well. If earnings don't match the dividend for long enough, and there's a dividend cut, you're going to take some big losses.7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio AroundI think the risk of that happening to Chevron is bigger than that happening to Exxon Mobil.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #2, Pfizer (PFE)Source:Kojach Via FlickrPFE Dividend Yield:4.1%Pfizer Inc.(NYSE:PFE) is a great dividend stock as far as yield is concerned. But can you trust it?But can you trust it? This is not just a question of whether the company can afford to pay shareholders out of earnings (which Pfizer usually can't). It's also a question of whether the company even wants torunas a dividend company.In November 2015, Pfizer said no to that. It announced a $160 billion deal to merge withAllergan plc(NYSE:AGN), which was only paying 5 cents per share in dividends, and to move its headquarters to Ireland for tax purposes. The hope was that the combined company would deliver fat capital gains to shareholders. A change in rules from the Treasury Department forced the two companies apart last April. If the deal were presented today, it's likely the new administration would approve it.What investors are getting today is a company whose profit margins have been falling steadily for years, as its biggest drugs (like Lipitor) come off-patent, with a declining asset base, and with operating cash flow which, while improving lately, still represents less than 10 cents for each dollar of equity.Pfizer, in short, looks like a very lazy company that may, or may not, pull a rabbit out of its hat and become something that it is not, which is a company you buy for capital gains. The company was expected to earn 50 cents per share but reported 47 cents.The question remains, is Pfizer good for its dividend? Does management evenwantit to be a dividend stock? There are opportunities in this Dow dividend stock, but also risks - the kind an income investor learns to avoid.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February: #1, Verizon Communications (VZ)Source:Via FlickrVZ Dividend Yield:4.7%The best yield among Dow dividend stocks, and one of the safest, is the 4.7% presently paid to shareholders ofVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) - the former Baby Bell that has emerged as one of two duopolists in the mobile and Internet backbone businesses.Verizon is the very model of a stock you buy for income. Its performance usually matches that of the market, and the dividend is regular. The company delivered 46 cents per share to shareholders at the bottom of the last recession, and now delivers almost 58 cents.This means that when the stock becomes oversold, as the traders say, which happened last November and in September 2015, and which some sayis happening right now, you buy. Then you hold and enjoy the yield.The latest bargain time comes on an earnings miss announced Jan. 24. Traders may have been disappointed, but the $1.10 per share in income still covers the dividend almost twice over, and Verizon remains committed to maintaining the dividend. Verizon is a cash flow monster, delivering about $30 billion in operating cash flow each year. Its business model works.Verizon buys income-producing assets and then milks profit from them. That's why it bought the rest of its mobile arm, Verizon Communications, payingVodafone Group PLC (ADR)(NASDAQ:VOD) $130 billion in 2014 and dramatically hiking its debt-to-assets ratio. That's why is said to be considering a tie-up withCharter Communications, Inc.(NASDAQ:CHTR), which recently boughtTime Warner Cable.The Charter interest comes as rivalAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) moves to buyTime Warner Inc.(NYSE:TWX) to get programming to fill its delivery systems, which along with the mobile arm include wired Internet (sold under the name U-Verse) and DirecTv. Verizon's moves in the direction of content have been more modest, buyingAOLand the operating assets ofYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) for Internet advertising assets.But this is the model for an income stock. You buy assets you can make a profit on, you extract that profit as aggressively as you reasonably can, and you pay that income out to shareholders, holding just enough so you can become an acquirer again.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsVZ is the very model of a high-yielding income stock.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

How FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Can Return 35% This Year;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors who are looking for a potential turnaround candidate in 2017 that can outperform the market should considerFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE). Despite the stock's 6% rise year to date, FEYE stock - currently around $13 - is poised to reach $17 per share,delivering some 35% returns.makeArticleAd();FEYE Stock and the Need for CybersecuritySource:David via Flickr (Modified)Imagine a world where you didn't have to keep multiple passwords for the various websites you visit daily and a world where you didn't have to worry that the point-of-sale system at the checkout counter of your favorite retailer could steal your credit card number and other personal information.Now wake up.In the world we live in, it's cybersecurity companies like FireEye, whichaccountedfor over half of the advanced malware industry revenue in 2015, that help prevent these things from happening.With hackers attacking major companies likeJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) andThe Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD), cybersecurity continues to be an increasingly important issue that companies must address, especially as they transition their business more towards mobile platform platforms and mobile apps.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018As a pioneer of the green field malware sandbox niche, FireEye is poised to re-capture what it lost in the cyber security space.FireEye Growth ProspectsIn a February 2016 report by consulting company NTT Com Security, half of the 1,000 business executives said they did not have a formal plan in place to secure and protect company data if they were hacked. These corporations now have no other choice by to spend money.In 2020, these organizations are expected to spend$101.6 billionon cybersecurity software, services, and hardware, according to research by the International Data Corporation (IDC).That level of spending amounts to a 38% rise from the $73.7 billion that IDC projects organizations will spend on cybersecurity in 2016. This puts FireEye and FEYE stock in a great situation. FireEye still has best-of-breed security offering that can help market share from network security vendors likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT), thanks to its malware sandboxing technology, used for detecting advanced security threat before they find their way into a network.And with the corporations lacking adequate threat-prevention/threat-detection tools, FireEye's revenue - which have slowed in recent years - should begin to climb.Twitter Inc (TWTR) Sells Fabric, So Where Is the Takeover Offer?""Security has become heavily scrutinized by boards of directors demanding that security budgets are used wisely and solutions operate at peak efficiency,"" said Sean Pike, IDC's vice president of security products, in a statement.Bottom Line for FEYE StockFireEye will report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results on Thursday. The company, which has beaten analysts' earnings-per-share estimates in five straight quarters, is projected to lose $1.13 per share in the current fiscal year and lose another 46 cents per share in fiscal 2017.After losing 41% of its value in 2016, FireEye's cost-cutting efforts are expected to have meaningful impact on its bottom line, as 2017 adjusted loss projected to narrow from $1.47 per share to 47 cents. Combined with new product launches to grow the top line, FEYE stock could be a hidden gem, reaching $17 per share.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postHow FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Can Return 35% This Yearappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Cisco Snatches IPO Baby from the Arms of Wall Street;1/27/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();On January 24,Cisco (CSCO)revealed they were buying a private company called AppDynamics for $3.7 billion. The funny thing is that the little guy already had a stock symbol picked out, APPD, for its scheduled IPO this week. Talk about a buzzer-beater.But Cisco is also viewed as paying a hefty premium for a software firm specializing in a niche called application performance management (APM). Why would they do that?According to Pacific Crest Securities, ""AppDynamics is a natural fit for Cisco's portfolio, in our view, given its ability to monitor legacy applications and infrastructure and its growing presence in next-generation application deployments.""AppDynamics' software stack now allows Cisco's product portfolio to extend its insight across the network, security and application layers. The acquisition broadens Cisco's software portfolio as Cisco attempts to diversify its revenue base with more subscription and recurring revenue.""Tech Titans Clash With War Chests of CashThis was precisely a theme that I discussed on the Zacks Ultimate webinar January 12: tech titans like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM, Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) ""battling for innovation"" with war chests of cash to scoop up ""off-the-shelf"" technology before the other guy.And MarketWatch reported in a story on January 25 that there is a trend of the smaller companies gladly accepting these buyouts to avoid the market volatility of the public markets. ThinkTwilio (TWLO)there. Here were a couple of interesting lines from the story by Caitlin Huston...""Just last week, SimpliVity, a software company, took a big valuation cut after it agreed to be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) for $650 million in cash, compared with a $1 billion private valuation.""Cisco and HPE show that large legacy tech companies are willing to swoop in to acquire startups, but the wide range of potential outcomes could lead to startups trying to stay private another year,"" said Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Capital Partners. The top-tier of unicorn companies, such as SnapChat and Airbnb are not as affected, he added.Stifel: Potential Takeout Candidates After APPD DealCourtesy of TheFly.com...Cisco's acquisition of AppDynamics is a sign that the wave of Software deal activity in 2016 has carried over into the new year, Stifel analyst Brad Reback tells investors in a research note. He believes the deal bodes well for the small- and mid-cap names across his firm's coverage list, including potential consolidation candidates such as Barracuda (CUDA), ChannelAdvisor (ECOM), FireEye (FEYE), HubSpot (HUBS), Paycom (PAYC), Paylocity (PCTY), Proofpoint (PFPT), SecureWorks (SCWX), Splunk (SPLK), Tableau (DATA), Ultimate Software (ULTI), Veeva (VEEV) and Zendesk (ZEN). He notes that AppDynamics most directly competes against other application performance management vendors such as New Relic (NEWR) and privately-held Dynatrace.Death By AmazonThis was my theme for the Zacks Ultimate webinar earlier this month. You can watch all or part of it below in the player, and there's no sales pitch. This was premium content for our ZU members that we wanted to share with a wider audience because we thought it was so good.While I've been furiously researching the ""Amazon Effect"" onmobile commerce, entrepreneurship, and public companies like Macy's for the past 2 years, I can't take credit for the ""Death By Amazon"" tag.That comes from Bespoke Investment Group who actually created an index to follow the public company impact of Amazon's disruptive model as it has grown at exponential scale. I show their chart in the webinar.And my latest research project is focused on Facebook advertising which grew 55% to $26.5 billion last year and will add another $10 billion this year.Facebook Ads are truly an economic phenomenon because they are actually expanding the pie that Google Adwords created with PPC (pay per click).In other words, just like the ""Gig Economy"" creates jobs the government doesn't know about, the ""GAF (Google-Amazon-Facebook) Economy"" is creating thousands of small businesses that you maybe didn't know about.Exploring the GAF EconomyCheck out the webinar below where I also had a great discussion with my colleague Eric Dutram, Zacks ETF Strategist, as his topic -- the Internet of Things -- fit in perfectly with mine.And I highlight 4 areas of disruption after I studied the investment approach of VC Chris Sacca of lowercase capital who hit grand slams with Twitter, Uber, Instagram and Twilio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs theTAZR Traderservice.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cisco Gambles $3.7 Billion on Software;1/26/2017;"Image source: Cisco Systems.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , the dominant provider of enterprise switches and   routers, is still predominantly a hardware company. Just 29% of   total revenue during the latest quarter was recurring, coming   from either software subscriptions or services.makeArticleAd();The software business, which is spread across all of Cisco's   reportable segments, is growing fast: deferred revenue from   recurring software and subscription businesses grew by 48% year   over year to $3.8 billion during the latest quarter. But hardware   is still the core of Cisco's business.Cisco has managed to maintain its dominance and its margins in   the switching and routing businesses despite major shifts in the   world of IT, like the emergence of cloud computing and   software-defined networking. But neither business is growing   consistently. Software will be one of the key growth drivers for   Cisco going forward, and the company hasn't been shy about making   acquisitions to push software revenue higher.A $3.7 billion bet on softwareOn Jan. 24, Cisco announced that it had agreed to pay $3.7   billion in cash and assumed equity awards for privately held   AppDynamics, a provider of a cloud applications and   business-monitoring platform. AppDynamics was just one day away   from going public, and Cisco paid a hefty premium to scoop up the   company at the last second. AppDynamics' last private fundraising   round yielded a valuation of $1.9 billion, and the high-end of   its IPO price range represented a market capitalization of just   $1.7 billion.""Applications have become the lifeblood of a company's   success,"" said Cisco SVP Rowan Trollope. Cisco believes that   the acquisition will allow it to provide ""end to end visibility   and intelligence from the network through the application.""   AppDynamics will become a new software business unit within   Cisco's Internet of Things and applications business, with the   deal expected to close during Cisco's fiscal third quarter.Because AppDynamics was so close to going public, this is a   rare case where the financials of an acquired private company   have been publicly disclosed. Cisco isn't getting much revenue   for its $3.7 billion investment. AppDynamics has produced $158   million of revenue through the nine months ended Oct. 31, up   about 55% year over year. Full-year revenue would be somewhere   around $230 million if that rate of growth holds. Cisco is paying   roughly 16 times sales.AppDynamics is also unprofitable, producing a net loss of $134   million during the last fiscal year and $95 million through the   nine months ended Oct. 31. Big spending on sales and marketing, a   common feature of fast-growing subscription software companies,   is the main culprit. Operating expenses are growing slower than   revenue, a sign that things are moving in the right direction,   but this deal won't provide any boost to Cisco's bottom line.Not a fan of this dealAs a Cisco shareholder, it's hard for me to get behind this   acquisition. Cisco's timing, racing against the clock to close   the deal, led to a price that was more than twice the expected   IPO price. Granted, the stock may have surged following its   now-cancelled IPO. But this doesn't seem like a company that   Cisconeededto own, price be damned.Cisco has always been acquisitive, but many of its deals have   been smaller, measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars.   Bigger recent deals include the $1.4 billion purchase of Jasper   Technologies in early 2016 and the $2.7 billion purchase of   Sourcefire in 2013. The deal for AppDynamics is bigger than both   of those, and one of the largest Cisco has made in years.To be fair, putting Cisco's resources behind AppDynamics could   turbocharge growth. But it will take an awful lot of growth to   justify the $3.7 billion price tag. I'm not convinced that this   deal is a good idea. If Cisco starts making a habit of overpaying   for start-ups valued in the billions of dollars, shelling out   more than a dozen times sales, I may have to reconsider my   investment in the company.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cisco Boosts Software Offerings with AppDynamics Buyout;1/26/2017;"Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOannounced Tuesday that it is on track to acquire AppDynamics, Inc.,a business software company based in the U.S. for approximately $3.7 billion. The development comes ahead of AppDynamics' IPO registration that had an estimated price band of $12 to $14 per share.  Cisco's offer of $26 per share was roughly double that price band and an irresistible proposition to miss for AppDynamics.The deal is expected to close in Apr 2017 and will involve both cash and equity awards.Although shares of Cisco opened Wednesday at $31.04 rising 1.43% during early trading, the stock came down all the way to close the session at $30.70, posting a gain of only 0.33% on an end of day basis. Notably, the stock has performed more or less in-line with the ZacksComputer Networkingindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 29.9%, Cisco is up 31.1%.The moderate performance of the stock could be attributed to slowing order growth from service providersas well as an intensifying competitive landscape due to the emergence of several smaller players.Why This Move?With the emergence of cloud computing, many legacy technology companies which remain dependant on on-premises setups for enterprises are shifting their focus on the software space.Not surprisingly, with CEO Chuck Robbins at the helm, Cisco has also been increasingly focusing on the software space. Moreover, with the emergence of less expensive routers and switches in the market, the company remains focused on other business verticals such as the ""Internet of Things,"" security and collaboration to remain competitive and relevant.How is Cisco Poised to Benefit?The AppDynamics deal is likely to strengthen Cisco's software offerings targeted at large enterprise clients.The objective of the deal is to drive growth for the company beyond its networking business that still remains the mainstay for the technology giant.Also, as AppDynamics is compatible with cloud services offered by various companies such as IBMIBMand AlphabetGOOGL-owned Google, the prospects look bright for Cisco going ahead.Per an IDC report, worldwide spending on public cloud services is estimated to reach $195 billion in 2020 that is currently growing at a CAGR of 20.4%. With increasing adoption for the cloud, technologies such as those offered by AppDynamics look poised to witness decent growth, which translates to a positive impact on Cisco's bottomline.Cisco Systems, Inc.

Cisco Buys 45th Company In 5 Years, Revenues Still Stagnate;1/26/2017;"ByWolf Richter:Have Cisco's Financial Engineers Gone Nuts?Cisco (CSCO) is, let's say, in transition. It has been in transition for years, from networking hardware, such as switches and routers where it's getting battered by Chinese competition, to software where it's getting battered by… well you get the idea. The company is in a very competitive environment. And it's trying to buy its way out of it.In its latest move, it announced that it would acquire AppDynamics (APPD) - a ""performance management and IT operations analytics company,"" as it says - for $3.7 billion, plucking it out from the IPO pipeline on the eve of its IPO.makeArticleAd();That's a huge premium over an already rich IPO price. If bankers had priced the shares at the top of the indicated IPO range, the company would have gone public at a valuation of $1.7 billion. Cisco paid over twice that.""The fact that they were in their IPO process represented a window where we needed to make a decision,"" Cisco's VP of Corporate Development, Rob Salvagno, toldReutersin an interview.AppDynamics isn't huge - despite what that lofty price might indicate. And it isn't profitable either. According to itsfilingwith the SEC, it had $158.4 million in revenues for the nine months through October 31, 2016, up 54% year-over-year. And it lost $95 million, up 3% year-over-year.So at that pace, AppDynamics would have a little over $200 million in revenues in the 12-month period. In other words, Cisco is paying 18 times those revenues.If revenues increase 50% a year, for four years straight, so by the end of 2020, the company would have $1 billion in revenues, though revenue rarely grows in a linear manner like this - growth rates tend to slow down as a company gets larger. Nevertheless, if… by the end of 2020, it books $1 billion in revenues, Cisco would at that time still see a price tag of 3.7 times revenue.How much is that? Cisco had $49 billion in revenues in 2016 and a market capitalization of $153.6 billion. So its shares trade at a rich 3.1 times revenues. This is going to be a long, long wait, if it isn't eternal, before the AppDynamics gamble pays off.But no matter. Cisco is an acquisition machine. And price doesn't matter. Revenue doesn't matter either, as we will see in a moment.Since 2012, Cisco has acquired45 companies, from tiny startups to not so small companies, mostly in software, including computer security, data visualization, energy management, all manner of cloud software and services, mobile software and services, video, network software and services, and so on. For 26 of them, the terms were not disclosed. So we don't know how much Cisco spent in total for these outfits.But for the 19 acquisitions for which the terms were disclosed, Cisco spent $18.2 billion!Despite all these acquisitions and the fortune spent on them, Cisco's revenues haven't budged much over the past four years. Revenues in 2016, at $49.25 billion, were flat with 2015, and were up only 1.3% since 2013:So Cisco has spent well over $18 billion in five years on buying 45 companies, and revenues are stagnating?Oh, andbecauserevenues are stagnating, Cisco decided it had to cut costs. It blows billions of dollars on share buybacks every year, no problem. And it sinks billions more every year into overpriced acquisitions, no problem. But it has to cut ""costs,"" and so in August last year, it confirmed rumors that it would try to cut costs by about 15%, and to do that it would lay off 5,500 employees, or 7% of its global workforce.But no matter. Startup investors are dumping their babies into Cisco's big lap - and thus into the laps of public and private pension funds, stock portfolios, mutual funds and the like that all own Cisco shares. Those investors at the receiving end of Cisco's generous financial engineering are loving it. Without companies like Cisco, the whole system of unicorns would come tumbling down, as startup investors found their other exits largely blocked:in 2016, IPOs had their worst year since 2003.APPDynamics is based in San Francisco. It's part of the crazy boom, and its investors found their big-fat exit. The company had a pre-IPO valuation of $1.9 billion. So even those investors that got in at the last funding round made a bundle. Other startup investors see that too. Because everyone is hoping for those big-fat exits. And if IPOs no longer open those doors, well, Cisco or IBM (IBM) or some other large company, whose financial engineers have gone nuts, might still be able to.IBM is in trouble, and desperate hype is apparently required.

Bull of the Day: Broadcom (AVGO);1/26/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (AVGO)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T(T),Cisco(CSCO), orAlphabet(GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApple (AAPL)with radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.I Have $250... Do I Hear $300?So what has changed in a month to make Broadcom the Bull of the Day again?Simply this: the stock took off over 10% to new highs in the past six sessions as a couple of analysts bolstered their view of this must-own tech ""arms dealer."" While I've been following fund managers into AVGO for nearly 3 years, the growth story is not over.On January 18, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his Top Pick rating on AVGO shares and raised his view of the company's long term earnings potential to $17 EPS on the heels of the acquisition of Brocade (BRCD). Here's what he had to say...""Our analysis suggests the underlying EPS power of AVGO increases materially post BRCD (especially assuming they raise $1.5-2.0B from networking & real estate sales). We think AVGO could achieve >$17.00 of EPS by FY19 (prior $16) and the stock should work in an upside scenario to $250+.""Oddly, the analyst did not raise his existing price target from $200.So we'll leave that to a bolder fan of the company...On January 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenback raised his price target on Broadcom to $240 from $210, and obviously reiterated his Overweight rating. Here's the MS view...""Increasing our PT to $240 from $210 and highlighting a bull case valuation of $300. Our PT is based on a 15X P/E on CY18 EPS, representing a turn increase from the current multiple but still a conservative 20% discount to the high end Semiconductor peers and 15% below the market. AVGO's multiple has been flat (100% of stock appreciation has been driven by growth in EPS) compared to a roughly 2x turn increase in semiconductor stocks, with investors unwilling to pay up for acquired growth.""However, we now have increased conviction that clearer focus on its outperforming core business, materially higher cash returns and ongoing margin expansion will drive a re-rating over the next 6-12 months.""The combination of Avago and Broadcom is unmatched in Networking (40% sales) in our view, which has positive implications for both growth (share gains) and profitability. We also think the company remains well positioned in RF to exploit the next growth driver of carrier aggregation, leveraging its leadership in premium filters and multiplexers.""The AVGO CampaignAnd there you have an update on the continuing saga that I call ""The AVGO Campaign."" It tells you what works and makes you money in a bull market: finding earnings momentum winners that you know institutions will continue to buy until the cycle ends.Consider AVGO your ""playbook stock"" for how to use the Zacks Rank to swing trade fundamentally-strong companies quarter after quarter.You can find out more by following me in myTAZR Traderservice.Zacks' best stocks under $10As a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy, today's Bull of the Day has a short-term 1 to 3-month profit zone.

Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL-QCOM Deal, FB's Zuckerberg Testifies;1/25/2017;"With the 45thPresident of the United States vowing to bring back jobs to the country, teach China a lesson and institute large-scale tax reform, there has been a great deal of uncertainty surrounding technology stocks. To make matters worse, President Trump has an axe to grind with AmazonAMZNand AppleAAPLwhile most AlphabetGOOGLexecutives have openly supported the democrats going into the elections.So companies are now making nice with the President like Tesla's Elon Musk, who has changed tunes and is now tweeting his support. It's been reported that Google's Schmidt has also found reasons to visit the President. Executives that have supported Trump from the start are better off: some speculate that Zuckerberg is considering politics while ex-MicrosoftMSFTand GM employee Chris Liddell is moving to the White House as assistant to the President and director of strategic initiatives. Oracle CEO Safra Catz joined the executive committee of Trump's presidential transition team in December.Then there's Cramer, promising us that the post inauguration sell-off won't last and that it's actually an opportunity to buy stocks.Amidst all the excitement surrounding the swearing in, the FTC sued QualcommQCOMfor anti-competitive practices while Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend Facebook'sFBpurchase of Oculus. So let's dig in.Apple Forced to Use Qualcomm ChipsFollowing similar lawsuits, huge fines ($1 billion in China and $890 million in Korea) and anticompetitive investigations in Taiwan and the EU, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued Qualcomm for ""de facto exclusive deals that were as effective as express purchase requirements and that effectively foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from gaining processor business at Apple.""The FTC alleges that Qualcomm allowed Apple billions in discounts for exclusively using its chips and not using the competing 4G Wi-Max standard that Intel was pushing. This agreement, running from 2011 to 2016, ultimately killed WiMax. Apple wasted no time in sourcing from Intel after the expiry of the agreement in Sep 2016.Another point in contention is Qualcomm's practice of limiting access to its cellular chips and then hiking royalty payments, amounting to ""a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm's competitors."" The FTC filed the lawsuit after a 2-1 vote. Qualcomm has of course denied the charges while Apple chose not to comment.Following the FTC lawsuit, Apple filed one of its own against Qualcomm for a billion dollars. The amount is what Apple alleges that Qualcomm is witholding for rebates. Like the FTC says, the deal was to keep Qualcomm chips in Apple products and is a fair indication that Qualcomm finally has some real competition.Mark Zuckerberg TestifiesFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand last week to deny charges that Facebook was aware of the violation of any employee agreement between Occulus head John Carmack and its former employer id Software, a unit of ZeniMax, the plaintiff in this case. He also denied that the technology developed by the startup Occulus and its founder Palmer Luckey was based on copyrighted technology belonging to ZeniMax.Carmack previously testified that he copied files from ZeniMax before moving to Occulus but did not use the information in Occulus and the terms of his employment allowed him to get involved with Occulus even while in ZeniMax employ. But the thing that could cost Facebook at this point is ZeniMax lawyer Toni Sammi's question: ""So your plan for a $2-point-something billion deal was to begin legal diligence on Friday, and sign the deal on Monday, over a weekend, right?"" to which Zuckerberg said, ""Yeah.""CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.09%+21.62%FB+0.33%+6.42%YHOO-0.14%+10.80%GOOGL-0.16%+9.94%MSFT+0.21%+16.26%INTC+0.63%+5.38%CSCO+0.20%+0.64%AMZN-0.65%+9.82%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateIndia Considering Apple Case: It's hard to tell just how badly India wants Apple to manufacture in the country. But if government officials agree to Apple's demands, it would indicate that they want it bad. Because Apple has asked for just about every concession possible, ranging from reduction in import duties on smartphones, customs duty exemption on manufacturing equipment and raw materials, a ""less-intrusive"" customs procedure to be completed in 30 minutes, the right to import and refurbish iPhones that are more than 3 years old so they can be exported, and so forth.Apple is trying to convince government officials that Indian made iPhones won't be competitive unless they give in to these demands even as its manufacturing costs in China are on the rise. But Asian phone makers are already manufacturing in the country with no such concessions, so the regulations themselves may need to be altered and relaxed to accommodate not just Apple but also other manufacturers. This could take time.On a positive note, Reuters reports that Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has mentioned the setting up of a government panel headed by the cabinet secretary that would now clear investment proposals in the electronics sector above $1 billion, instead of them going through multiple government departments.Microsoft Executive Joins Baidu: Baidu has appointed Qi Lu as its Chief Operating Officer and Group Head as it turns focus to artificial intelligence as the next growth driver. The company was mixed up in a scandal involving medical ads that led to stricter government regulations and consequently hit its revenues.Lu left Microsoft last year on health concerns but was in charge of its search business and also part of the team involved in architecting its artificial intelligence and bots technology. He holds more than 40 U.S. patents.Google Ad Auctions Are Suspect: The Wall Street Journal has independently confirmed that ads for Google products and the products of its sister companies usually find the top spot on the search engine results page. On checking 25K search results, it found that Google products occupied the top spot 91% of the time and the top two spots 43% of the time.Google has said that this is because it is also a buyer of ads, so its position comes from paying a higher price. It also says that this doesn't raise prices because when others bid for the price, it's as if Google isn't bidding. Bottom line: other advertisers lose the top spot no matter what they bid for it. Google reportedly removed its ads in a number of cases when confronted with the data last December.Amazon, Apple End Audiobook Exclusivity Deal: Apple and Amazon have decided to end the deal initiated back in 2008, according to which Amazon subsidiary Audible became the exclusive supplier of audiobooks to Apple and was barred from selling to any other party. The agreement was actually serving no one because the market for audiobooks has advanced since then and it's now in the interest of both parties to be able to source from others and in Audible's case, to also be able to sell on other platforms. Nonetheless, it was preceded by regulatory scrutiny of the deal by German and EU competition authorities that felt it was inflating prices.Pandora Shares Gain: Pandora preannounced fourth-quarter results that it said exceeded its revenue and EBITDA targets. This came as a relief because it has been lowering expectations the last two quarters indicating continuing bad news. Moreover, Pandora also said that the $5-a-month Pandora Plus garnered 365K new subscribers in the quarter and the Pandora Premium service remained on track to launch later this quarter. It also expects to lay off around 7% of the U.S. workforce, which will further boost margins.Legal/RegulatoryCisco-Arista Developments: The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency has expressed concern that its earlier decision to lift the ban on Arista switches may have been incorrect. Following conversations with CiscoCSCO, the CBP therefore intends to reinstate the ban. Arista has said that it will respond to Cisco points and re-engage with the CBP.In the meantime, U.S.-manufactured switches will have to make do, which can result in supply glitches and pressure on its gross margin. On Dec 2, the ITC judge ruled that Arista patents infringe on Cisco's and Arista has subsequently produced workaround while denying the charges. A full commission review of the judge's decision will be completed by Apr 9.New Technology/ProductsGoogle to Launch Android One Phones In U.S.: Google's high-end Pixel phones are mostly unavailable, but it's already gearing up to launch the low-end ($200-$300) Android One devices in the country by the middle of the year. The goal seems to be to build brand value and familiarize people with the Android ecosystem.Android One was first launched in India and later in other countries including Japan and then Europe. It is a system under which Google agrees beforehand with handset manufacturers to push out Android updates as soon as they are available so the experience is true to the latest iteration of the software.M&A and CollaborationsHPE Buying Simplivity: Hewlett Packard Enterprise is dishing out $650 million to buy SimpliVity, the second largest provider of hyperconvergence software (after Nutanix which has over 50% market share). The company describes a hyperconverged system as one that integrates compute, storage and networking into a pre-configured system, managed by a user-friendly software platform that doesn't require extensive IT staff for set up and management.Within a couple of months after the deal closes, HPE will offer a range of integrated HPE SimpliVity hyperconverged systems based on HPE ProLiant Servers. The acquisition significantly strengthens its position in the space where competitors like Cisco and Dell/EMC base their hyperconvergence solutions on market leader Nutanix or Simplivity software. HPE will initially support current SimpliVity customers.Cisco, Ericsson Join Forces in Australia: The collaboration between Ericsson and Cisco on telecom cloud infrastructure has yielded a major customer in Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA). The companies will virtualize Vodafone's infrastructure, enabling it to improve customer service and user experience while increasing network agility, reducing opex and capex, and speeding up the deployment of services. The partnership has reportedly generated 60 new deals and is expected to generate revenue of a billion dollars to each partner by 2018.Microsoft Acquires Simplygon: Microsoft has acquired 3D data optimization specialist Simplygon of Sweden for an undisclosed sum. This is intended to play an important role in developing its 3D For Everyone strategy, which is part of the Windows 10 Creators Update. 3D optimization is used by game developers and others to facilitate 3D content creation.Simplygon also does more than this: it has already started optimizing content for AR and VR technology, including for Microsoft's Hololens. Microsoft believes that by making the technology a part of its creators update, users will be empowered to capture, create and share 3D content thus augmenting their productivity, collaboration and creativity.Google Buys Twitter Developers Platform: Google has acquired Fabric, which is based on Crashlytics technology (crash analytics, app feedback and real-time analytics) that Twitter acquired back in 2013. Google hasn't said how much it's paying for Fabric, but has said that it will be a part of its cloud based mobile software effort called Firebase that was itself acquired in 2014. Firebase offers mobile app developers tools to build and monitor their apps, so any attempt to build its capabilities should help the company attract developers.Alibaba Has Long-term Digital Deal: Alibaba and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) signed a deal, according to which Alibaba will be responsible for the IOC's digital presence through its cloud platform. The deal makes Alibaba the digital sponsor of the Olympics in cloud services, e-commerce and television for a period running through 2028. While immediate returns may not there, this lends credibility to the service and should help Alibaba win big customer accounts.WDC Considering Toshiba Stake: Nikkei Asian Review has reported that Toshiba is looking to spin off or sell off a 20% stake in its chip business in which case Western Digital might be the one picking it up. Toshiba is in trouble right now as it has to deal with an unprofitable nuclear business and accounting scandal that requires it to cough up some cash. Selling off a share to its longtime partner Western Digital (the two operate a flash memory fab in Japan) might be just the answer it needs.Some NumbersUK App Store Prices Up: As a result of the pound's continued declines, Apple has been compelled to raise App store prices by as much as 25%.Intel Invests in Retail Tech: At the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York, Intel said that it intended to invest $100 million in retail technology over the next five years.

Why New Relic Shares Soared Today;1/25/2017;"Image source: New Relic.What happenedShares of application performance monitoring (APM) specialistNew Relic(NYSE: NEWR) have soared today, up by 14% as of 12:35 p.m. EST,   after networking giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) announced it would acquire peer AppDynamics for   $3.7 billion.makeArticleAd();So whatThe news comes just days before the latter private company was   preparing to go public. AppDynamics had already filed to go   public under the ticker APPD, and its IPO was expected to price   this week. Both companies offer APM tools, among other software   solutions.Now whatThe acquisition suggests that other publicly traded peer   companies should perhaps be fetching higher valuation multiples.   At least one analyst at Cowen made that argument, noting that   AppDynamics is being acquired at around 10 times enterprise value   to projected 2017 sales. APM offerings are becoming increasingly   important and the space is likely to heat up. New Relic may also   enjoy some seasonal tailwinds heading into the latter half of   2017, and adoption of New Relic's new Server offering is expected   to rise as well.10 stocks we like better than New RelicWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Ignore Palo Alto Networks Inc: Here Are 3 Better Stocks;1/25/2017;"Palo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) kicked off the year with a bang, rising   nearly 13% so far in January, nearly 4% since competitorCheck Point Software(NASDAQ: CHKP) reported finishing 2016 with another solid   quarter. However, Palo Alto investors have seen this movie   before. Palo Alto stock was flying high with its string of   reporting 50% quarterly jumps in revenue each quarter, which   ended earlier this year.Now that sales growth has slowed to the low 30% range,   and expectations are for even less in the quarter that ends at   the end of this month, the roller-coaster ride that comes with   owning shares of Palo Alto will likely continue. But there are a   few data security stocks that offer upside without as much risk,   including one ideal for growth and income investors. Let's take a   look.makeArticleAd();Image source: Check Point Software.Check Point: Similar, but differentOne reason Check Point stock is bumping up against its 52-week   high is that CEO Gil Shwed's strategy of growing subscription   sales -- a source of recurring revenue -- have been an   unmitigated success. Check Point increased sales 6% year over   year to $487 million last quarter, but its subscription   revenue soared 26% to $110 million.A year ago, subscriptions equaled 19% of total revenue;   now that figure is 23% and climbing. Not only do recurring sales   give Check Point a relatively solid revenue foundation, the shift   is also in line with Shwed's focus on managing expenses.   Recurring revenue costs less to generate over time than new   sales, which is one reason Check Point offers less risk than its   peer.Expense management helps set Check Point apart from Palo Alto.   It helped drive a 21% jump in Check Point's earnings per share   (EPS) last quarter. Check Point's total operating   expense equaled 50% of revenue last quarter, which has   generally been the case. And Palo Alto? Including the cost of   revenue, as is the case with Check Point's expenses-to-sales   results, Palo Alto's overhead was approximately $50 million more   than it generated in revenue.Image source: Cisco.Cisco: Bigger and betterLast quarter,Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) reported $540 million in security sales, good for   an 11% improvement year over year. In addition to Cisco's   in-house data security solutions, its $71 billion in cash and   equivalents allow it to continue adding to its product suite, as   it did last quarter with the closing of its $293 million deal for   CloudLock.Similar to Check Point and, to a lesser extent, Palo Alto,   Cisco has adopted a subscription-based model. CFO Kelly Kramer in   a November press release pointed to Cisco's subscription and   software offerings ""as we transition our business to a more   recurring revenue model"" as a key to its 3% EPS growth year over   year, after one-time charges. Not bad considering Cisco grew   total sales -- after excluding its now divested SP Video unit --   by 1% to $12.4 billion.Another reason Cisco warrants inclusion on a list of stocks   that are better than Palo Alto is the diversity of its business.   Cisco has long been a leader in switches and routers, but it   continues to add software, cloud data center, and Internet of   Things (IoT) solutions to its arsenal, along with security. In   addition to its relative stability and product diversification,   Cisco's nearly 3.5% dividend yield also makes it an ideal growth   and income alternative. Palo Alto does not pay a dividend.Image source: Fortinet.Fortinet: Consistently profitableThe closest to Palo Alto among these three stocks isFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) in that it has also enjoyed soaring total revenue.   Like Palo Alto, Fortinet's 22% increase in sales to $316.6   million in the third quarter was down after a string of even   stronger quarters. However Fortinet, like Check Point and Cisco,   doesn't spend more than it generates and its profitability   translates to slightly less risk than Palo Alto with its mounting   losses..Though not in Check Point's range of 50%, or even Cisco's 76%,   Fortinet's combined cost of revenue and operating expense   equaled 98% of total sales. A rather sizable jump in sales   and marketing-related overhead played a big role in Fortinet's   costs last quarter, and it likely will again when it announces   earnings on Jan. 26.However, Fortinet is consistently profitable, and while not   growing its top line as it had been, the 32% increase in deferred   revenue of $934.8 million last quarter bodes well for the   future.The reliability of Check Point, Cisco's market strength and   dividend, and the consistent profitability of Fortinet while   growing revenue 20% or more each quarter makes each one a better   stock than Palo Alto.10 stocks we like better than Palo Alto       NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Mosaic Co (MOS) and Intel Corporation (INTC);1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBreakouts are the name of the game today as our three big stock charts coverCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO),Mosaic Co(NYSE:MOS) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), all of which are moving above or challenging strong technical resistance levels.makeArticleAd();A breakout above these key prices are likely to lead to significantly fast and aggressive rallies higher. Hold onto your hats!Cisco Systems (CSCO)Cisco shares are making a break for it this morning on news that the company isacquiringAppDynamics.The stock has spent the past few months trading in a tight trading range. Technical trendlines have tightened that range lately. The move today, should fuel a breakout higher.Shares of the Cisco will open the day above their 50-day and 100-day for the first time since November, potentially making the beginning of a new bullish trend.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsOn an interesting technical note, the 10-day volatility of Cisco shares dropped to less than 50% of the 100-day volatility recently. This is often a sign that a stock is ready to make a breakout move.Shares of Cisco are setting this bullish course weeks ahead of their earnings announcement, scheduled for the Feb. 15. The stock tends to make large tradable moves, both higher and lower, ahead of earnings reports. Yesterday's breakout may be the initiation of the Cisco pre-earnings trade.Mosaic Co (MOS)Mosaic made a MONSTER move yesterday on heavy volume as the stock got an upgrade from Cowan. More notable was the fact that the stock broke above the $32 level. We identified this level weeks ago as a potential trigger for a short covering rally given the large bets against the stock.Yesterday's move took Mosaic to overbought readings while breaking into new relative high territory, a combination that will fuel a more short covering, though we expect the rally to see some selling pressure soon.The last pullback from an overbought reading mounted to a 10% decline in the stock. The current chart screams for support at the $32 level, which is where we expect any profit-taking to see the stock land.Mosaic doesn't report earnings until Feb. 7, meaning there is plenty of time for profit-taking to put the shares at a great entry price just ahead of earnings, when we expect to see the stock price get another bullish kick higher.Intel Corporation (INTC)Semiconductor companies have been leading the market higher without a familiar name, Intel. The semiconductor giant has been notably absent as it remained locked in a trading range, until the past few days.Shares of Intel are finally making a move to break above the $36 level, which would represent taking out the October highs.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings PreviewTraders have been tepid on their response to Intel as the volume has been lighter than normal on these moves. The past two days have been different though as volume registered in the high end of the past six months.The increase in volume tells us that the market is now allocating funds to Intel ahead of their Thursday afternoon earnings call. The message here may be positive. A break above the $32 level and anything outside of an earnings disappointment will spark a technical rally that should drive prices toward the $40 level over the intermediate-term outlook.More From InvestorPlace3 Key Blue-Chip Stocks Hogging All the Action7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio AroundThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Cisco Systems, Inc.

Cisco Acquires AppDynamics: What It Means For CSCO;1/25/2017;"Cisco (Shutterstock photo)Cisco (CSCO) made its first merger and acquisition for 2017, with its intent to acquire AppDynamics, a leading privately held application intelligence software platform. Cisco rushed to acquire AppDynamics just before the tech unicorn’s IPO. At $3.7 billion, Cisco has picked AppDynamics for twice its valuation price at $1.9 billion (at the time of its fundraising), making this its largest acquisition in recent times.Acquisitions are integral to the growth strategy for companies to drive more recurring revenue streams by enabling new market access, bringing in mature products and solutions, business models, as well as technology and talent.makeArticleAd();The acquisition comes as a part of Cisco’s broadercommitment“to capitalize on market transitions as sources of future opportunities as part of the continued transformation of its business.” Cisco believes that the market transition is happening at a great speed in the IT space and thus has been working to enhance its capabilities in the fast-emerging areas of security, collaboration, services, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, software, and silicon.Cisco, an active player in the acquisition market, has acquired 44 companies in the past five-years.Why AppDynamics?Software apps, application software, or simply apps, have become increasingly important for a company's success. Almost all businesses are faced with immense pressure to accelerate innovation while ensuring that those apps run and perform perfectly. Customers expect easy-to-use apps, but complexities at the company’s end are on the rise and all this requires a huge amount of IT back-end support.To ensure competitiveness with the increasingly demanding customers and stiffer competition, organizations cannot deploy legacy IT operations management products to monitor and manage their software applications and underlying IT infrastructures. Thus, Application Performance Monitoring (APM) companies have emerged as a preferred choice for enterprises to do the task.GartnerdefinesAPM “as one or more software and hardware components that facilitate monitoring to meet five main functional dimensions: end-user experience monitoring, runtime application architecture discovery modeling and display, user-defined transaction profiling, component deep-dive monitoring in application context, and analytics.”AppDynamics is among the major vendors of the global APM market and offers an innovative, enterprise-grade app intelligence software platform. AppDynamics has approximately 2,000customersall over the world, including leading companies such:TESCONasdaqExpediaOverstock.comNikeReserve Bank of New ZealandUBSDIRECTVExactTargetProgressiveThe company has grown rapidly, reflected by the rise in its revenue which was reported at $23.6 million, $81.9 million and $150.6 million during FY14, FY15 and FY16 (ended January of each year) respectively.With Cisco and AppDynamics coming together, enterprises can expect actionable insight not just into apps but across their technological stack that can be applied to improve business performance and customer experiences while generating revenue opportunities.David Wadhwani, CEO of AppDynamics, will continue to lead the company as a new software business unit under Rowan Trollope, Cisco's senior vice president and general manager of its IoT and Applications business. The acquisition is expected to close in Cisco’s third quarter of fiscal year 2017.With the complementary business AppDynamics brings to Cisco, the acquisition should result in a smooth integration and a boost to the revenue stream. Cisco’s shares are up 36.79% over the past one-year."

The company's recent efforts have focused on new areas of growth, including autonomous transportation, virtual reality/augmented reality and cloud computing; but if Trump successfully encourages a ramp up in capital expenditures and hiring across the corporate sector, there will be a surge of demand for regular PCs and servers as well, which remain at the heart of the company's revenue stream.The company will next report results on Jan. 26 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 75 cents per share on revenues of $15.8 billion.Blue-Chip Stocks Leading the Push: Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) shares are rising up and over a three-month downtrend to push to levels not seen since November 2014 - capping an incredible rise of over 70% off of its January 2016 lows.Initially, the rebound was driven by a stabilization of crude oil and commodity prices early last year, but more recently, Trump's surprise electoral win and promises to harness America's energy and metals recourses is lifting expectations of heavy equipment sales.7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundThe company will next report results on Jan. 26 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 67 cents per share on revenues of $9.8 billion.Blue-Chip Stocks Leading the Push: Cisco (CSCO)Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) shares are rising up and out of a multimonth downtrend pattern that started in September after testing support at its 200-day moving average in early December. The stock was slammed lower in November after reporting in-line revenue and issuing weak forward guidance.But, again, any boost to capex and profitability associated with Trump's economic plans will lift network hardware and software spending and boost CSCO.The company will next report results on Feb. 15 after the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 56 cents per share on revenues of $11.6 billion.Blue-Chip Stocks Leading the Push: IBM (IBM)International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) is surging to new highs, blasting out of a two-month consolidation range to hit levels not seen since September 2014. This follows what was initially a disappointed reaction to the company's reporting of better-than-expected quarterly earnings last week and the issuance of strong forward guidance.Revenue did, however, decline 1.3% from last year to continue a long string of revenue declines.7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in     2017The company will next report results on April 18 after the close.

Juniper Earnings Preview: Sluggish Demand For Routing, Security Products To Impact Results;1/24/2017;"Juniper Networks(JNPR) is scheduled to announce its Q4 and full year results on Thursday, January 26. The networking giant has reported 2% revenue growth through the first three quarters of the year to $3.6 billion. Growth was largely driven by the services segment, with combined product sales stagnating.Low product sales have led to discounted selling prices, which ultimately drove down product margins. This trend has continued over the last few years, with the adjusted gross margin for the product divisions combined falling from 67.6% in 2011 to around 65.3% in 2015. This has further compressed to 62.4% through the first three quarters of 2016. Additionally, Juniper's operating expenses in the same period increased by around 3% to $1.64 billion as shown below. Resulting earnings per share were down by around 5% over the comparable prior year period to $1.04.makeArticleAd();Guidance For Q4Juniper's management expects the trend from the first three quarters of the year to continue through the December quarter as well. Net revenues could grow at a steady 2% to $1.35 billion, with the most revenue growth coming from switching product sales and the services division. Gross margin could compress by around 80 basis points to around 63% as shown below. Management targets a long-term gross margin of around 64% in the coming quarters, which can be achieved by higher sales volumes and a high attach rate of customers in the services segment.In an attempt to improve profitability and earnings per share, management mentioned that the company aims to improve its cost structure in coming quarters. For December quarter, operating expenses are expected to fall by 9% y-o-y to around $510 million. If the company can successfully reduce operating expenses in the fourth quarter, Juniper's full year EPS could be around 3% higher than 2015 levels at $1.66 per share.Performance Across Product LinesJuniper has struggled in the network security domain with a double digit revenue decline over the last few years. For the first three quarters of the year, network security revenues were down 26% y-o-y to $237 million. In the same period, rival networking company Cisco (CSCO) reported 4% y-o-y growth in network security revenues to $1.6 billion. (Read:Cisco's 2016 In Review: Higher Profits Despite Revenue Slowdown)Similarly, Juniper's core routing revenues have witnessed limited growth over the last few years with a CAGR of 1% from 2011 through 2015. This trend continued in 2016 with revenues falling by 1% through the first three quarters of the year to $1.7 billion.On the other hand, Juniper's switching segment has performed well this year, with revenues rising by 9% y-o-y to $607 million through the first thee quarters of the year. The company has witnessed strong demand for its new QFX product line from various cloud providers, telecom customers, cable providers and Federal government agencies. In the most recent quarter, the company reported a 50% annual increase in revenues generated by sales of the QFX switch product line.In the same period, theservices segment has driven much of the top line growthfor the company, with revenues increasing by 12% y-o-y to just under $1.1 billion. In addition to revenue growth, the services segment has become more profitable for the company while falling hardware prices have compressed the product segment's margins. Juniper's services gross margin has improved by almost 2 percentage points to 62.1% through the first three quarters of the year due to a higher rate of maintenance contract renewals and a higher proportion of services-based networking solutions on offer.

Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years;1/20/2017;"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to “Make America great again,” promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.We won’t know for certain which of Trump’s policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trump’s policies take shape.makeArticleAd();Lower Corporate TaxesTrump’s promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.Beyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump — given his pro-business stance — were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (TSLA) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.“Repeal and Replace”The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to — among other things — “insure the un-insurable.” Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle you’re on, Obamacare either did its job or was a “complete disaster,” according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its  exposure to any changes Trump might make. What’s more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.Not every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).Scale Back Dodd-FrankCutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money — something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS), financials are once again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. ""There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank ""the number one priority on the regulatory side.”To that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes it’s tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’s not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial (PNC), which Trump has made great again."

Why Arista Networks, Progress Software, and Regions Financial Slumped Today;1/17/2017;"The stock market lost ground on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones   Industrials falling nearly 60 points and the S&P and Nasdaq   posting similar declines. Investors are waiting anxiously to see   whether anticipated new policies that President-elect Donald   Trump has previously announced will actually become law in the   near future, and others are nervous that potential political   turmoil could hamstring the new administration's early efforts on   some fronts. Moreover, some individual companies had bad news   that contributed to a poor day for the market, andArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) ,Progress Software(NASDAQ: PRGS) , andRegions Financial(NYSE: RF) were among the biggest decliners of the day. Below,   we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did   so poorly.Image source: Arista Networks.Arista gets bad news from a key court caseArista Networks fell 12% after an adverse decision by the U.S.   Customs and Border Protection agency. U.S. Customs said on Friday   that it had granted a revocation request fromCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , with the effect of undoing a judgment back in   November that had allowed Arista to continue importing products   from abroad. Arista will still be able to fulfill U.S. orders   from domestic manufacturers of its products, but others fear the   decision could eventually create a supply bottleneck that could   lead to customer discontent. Arista has said that it will fight   the decision by responding to Cisco's allegations, but the only   thing that's fairly certain is that the dispute is likely to last   well into the future.makeArticleAd();Progress reports a lossProgress Software dropped 14% in the wake of its fiscal   fourth-quarter earnings report late Monday. The application   development specialist said it saw total revenue jump 4% on   strength in software licenses, but a substantial $92 million   goodwill impairment charge sent Progress to a $73.8 million loss,   working out to $1.52 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings of   $0.62 per share were better than the consensus forecast, but   Progress' guidance for revenue of $387 million to $395 million   and adjusted earnings of $1.64 to $1.69 per share were below what   investors had hoped to see. Progress hopes that its new strategic   plan will generate long-term growth, using measures such as a   streamlined operating approach, a new product strategy for   development, and more efficient use of resources. Yet investors   remain concerned that strong competition in the industry could   weigh on Progress Software going forward.Regions gives back some gainsFinally, Regions Financial declined 6%. The regional bank has   performed extremely well recently, having posted gains of nearly   40% following the November election. Investors have gotten more   optimistic about regional banks in general, and rising interest   rates could lead to steeper yield curves that would be beneficial   for Regions Financial and its peers. Yet shareholders seemed   content to give back a small portion of those gains, given   uncertainty about whether the best-case scenario for the bank   will actually play out. Even with today's loss, Regions has seen   its stock climb more than 70% over the past year, and favorable   economic conditions could create even more growth in the   future.10 stocks we like better than Arista NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Arista Networks, Inc. Stock Plunged Today;1/17/2017;"IMAGE SOURCE: ARISTA NETWORKS, INC.What happenedShares ofArista Networks Inc.(NYSE: ANET) fell 12% on Tuesday on the heels of a negative court   ruling in its ongoing patent infringement case withCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) .makeArticleAd();So whatLate Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agencyrevokedits November ruling thatredesigned productsfrom Arista Networks don't infringe a key patent owned by   Cisco.""The revocation covers all Arista products,"" stated Mark   Chandler, Senior VP, General Counsel and Secretary of Cisco.   ""This means that Arista has lost the authorization to import or   continue selling its products in the U.S., or to import   components to build those products.""Of course, Arista will almost certainly appeal the decision.   But Wall Street analysts aren't sure exactly what kind of impact   this may have to the business over the near term.According toBarron'stoday, for example,Barclays' Mark Moskowitz, for example, ""[I]t is important to highlight   that even with the updated CBP ruling, Arista can continue to   fulfill orders through domestic manufacturing sources with   products that contain work-arounds. [...] Reason being, the   company did not shift its manufacturing back toward international   manufacturers after the initial ruling, in an effort to hedge   against an unfavorable ruling in the 945 investigation.""Meanwhile, MKM Partner's Michael Genovese simultaneously   reduced his price target on shares from $95 to $84, citing   reduced profit margin expectations even as he believes Arista   will likely continue to deliver industry-leading growth.Now whatIt's obvious this patent battle isn't over yet. But investors   will need to wait for more color on the situation when Arista   releases fiscal Q4 2016 results next month, assuming the company   doesn't issue an informational press release before then. In the   meantime, given this negative development and caution from Wall   Street, it's no surprise Arista Networks stock plunged today.10 stocks we like better than Arista NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

The 6 Biggest Risks to Twilio Inc. Stock;1/17/2017;"Twilio(NYSE: TWLO) has taken investors on a gut-churning roller-coaster   ride since its IPO last June. The company, which integrates calls   and SMS messages into apps with a cloud platform, saw its shares   surge from an IPO price of $15 to nearly $70 before pulling back   to the high $20s on concernsabout its valuation.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();But is Twilio now a worthy rebound play after that rout? Let's   take a closer look at the six biggest risks facing the company   (as outlined in its SEC filings) to find out.1. Its dependence on FacebookTwilio is heavily dependent onFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) . Facebook's WhatsApp generated 10% of Twilio's   revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. That represents   a decline from 17% in 2015, but Facebook recently added Twilio's   services to Messenger, which should increase its weight on   Twilio's top line again.To make matters worse, Facebook is a ""Variable Customer   Account"" which has ""never entered into  12-month minimum   revenue contracts with Twilio."" This means that Facebook can drop   Twilio's services at any time, and it isn't obligated to pay   Twilio a certain amount of guaranteed revenue.2. Its dependence on AmazonTwilio's cloud infrastructure is outsourced toAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS (Amazon Web Services). This means that an   outage at  AWS, which happened several times in recent   years, would knock all of Twilio's in-app phone and SMS services   offline -- which would be devastating for top customers like   WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb.Amazon could also emerge as a potential rival to Twilio if it   develops similar call and message processing services for AWS.   AWS' superior scale would then enable it to offer those services   at lower prices and render Twilio obsolete. But Amazon was an   early investor in Twilio, and it uses its platform to deliver SMS   messages for AWS -- so competing against Twilio would be    counterproductive.3. Its dependence on network service providersAs a middleman between network service providers and mobile   apps, Twilio is highly vulnerable to service providers hiking   their prices. Twilio admits in its latest 10-Q filing that ""the   fees that we are charged by network service providers may change   daily or weekly, while we do not typically change our customers'   pricing as rapidly.""Twilio also warns that ""many of these network service   providers do not have long-term committed contracts with us, and   may terminate their agreements with us without notice or   restriction."" This means that if the carriers decide to launch   their own cloud platforms for integrating calls and SMS messages   with apps, they could cut Twilio out of the loop and gut its core   business.4. Potential competition from CiscoTwilio also admits that legacy on-premise network equipment   vendors likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) could bundle Twilio-like services into their   networking hardware bundles for service providers. Doing so could   strengthen Cisco's service provider revenue, which dipped 2%   annually last  quarter.Integrating more cloud-based services would widen Cisco's moat   against rivals in the software-defined networking market while   pivoting its core business away from itsslower-growthrouters and switches -- but it could be devastating for   Twilio.5. Its dependence on growth abroadTwilio generated 15% of its revenue from international markets   in the first nine months of 2016. That's up from 14% in 2015 and   12% in 2014. Therefore, Twilio notes that it's been expanding its   overseas sales team, but that its experience in selling products   in non-U.S. markets was ""limited.""Twilio also warns that the no-stack, developer-first model   that generated such explosive growth in the U.S. might not gain   ""the same traction outside the United States."" Moreover, carriers   might not be as agreeable, similar platforms might emerge in   different countries, and developers might prefer to develop their   own call and SMS integration services from scratch. A   consistently strong dollar could also gobble up the company's   profits abroad.6. Its lack of profitabilityTwilio is still unprofitable by both GAAP (generally accepted   accounting principles) and non-GAAP (adjusted) metrics, and will   likely remain so for the foreseeable future. The company's   expenses will likely rise as it spending on sales teams to   acquire new customers and expand overseas goes up, and margins   could be pressured by competition from bigger rivals. This means   that Twilio's cash position will keep declining -- which could   lead to yet another share-diluting stock offering.The key takeawayI personally own a small position in Twilio, but I believe   that it will remain volatile this year due to the aforementioned   risks. However, if investors are willing to ride out that   volatility and Twilio maintains its ""best in breed"" reputation in   call and SMS integration, they could be well rewarded over the   next few years.10 stocks we like better than Twilio Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Ericsson-Cisco Duo to Build Telecom Cloud Infrastructure;1/17/2017;"After collaborating to develop modernized IP-based network for Telefonica Guatemala last week,Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(publ)ERICand its partner Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCO, have joined hands once again, this time to transform Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA)'s networks.Ericsson and Cisco have been making diligent efforts to build a telecom cloud infrastructure. Boosting the VHA network is indeed a major milestone as it marks Ericsson and Cisco's most prominent Telecom Cloud infrastructure collaboration. Per the latest deal, Ericsson will be responsible for building the infrastructure, along with ensuring delivery of an end-to-end operational system.Transformation and virtualization of Hutchison Australia (VHA)'s networks will enable it adapt to new services and improve its agility and programmability from ""network slicing"". Eventually, this will help the company introduce fresh applications, improve customer engagement and slash operational and capital expenditure. Further, Vodafone can gain access to new markets, including the Internet of Things, with this revamped infrastructure.The Ericsson-Cisco collaboration has been shaping up well, even since its inception in Nov 2015, with the two communication technology behemoths jointly bagging more than 60 deals in IP (routing and transport) and services. The duo has extended its routing, data center, networking, cloud, mobility, management and control, and global services capabilities to clients across the globe.At present, they enjoy 250 active customer engagements and remain optimistic that these will lead to lucrative award wins, moving ahead. After declaring deals with Vodafone Portugal, Aster Dominican Republic and Cable & Wireless in 2016, the Ericsson-Cisco team has also been cleared by the Brazilian regulatory authorities quite recently.Despite forging strategic partnerships and having a dominant presence in high-traffic LTE markets, Ericsson had a disastrous run on the bourse in 2016. The company's shares registered a plunge of 21.5%, over the past six months, comparing unfavorably to the Zacks classifiedWireless Equipmentindustry's average positive return of 7.4%. Soft mobile broadband demand, sluggish emerging markets and weaker-than-expected benefits from cost-cutting initiatives hampered the company's performance significantly.With three back-to-back earnings misses, over the trailing four quarters, Ericsson witnessed an unimpressive average negative earnings surprise of 23.0%. Currently, analysts are maintaining a neutral stance on the stock as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 remained unchanged at 33 cents over the past seven days. It will be interesting to see whether this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) continues with its string of misses or manages a surprise beat in its fourth-quarter 2016 earnings, which is slated to release next week.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Exa Corp.EXAand Harris CorporationHRS. While Exa Corp. flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Harris Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit;1/13/2017;"With interest rates set to rise this year, many dividend   investors are likely worried that their stocks will slip as bond   yields become more attractive. While somedividend   stockswillinevitably decline, investors can still find some low-risk income plays that have   high yields and cheap valuations. Let's take a look at three such   stocks --AT&T(NYSE: T) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andReynolds American(NYSE: RAI) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();TheDividend Aristocrat: AT&TAT&T's forward yield of 4.8% is much higher than the   S&P 500's 2.1% yield, and it's comfortably supported by a   payout ratio of 81%. It spent 72% of its free cash flow over the   past 12 months on dividends. AT&T has hiked its dividend   annually for over three decades, surpassing the 25-year threshold   for becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.In addition to being a rock-solid income play, AT&T is   becoming a growth play again with its acquisition of DirecTV and   proposed takeover ofTime Warner. Bundling its pay TV, wireless, and broadband internet services   together gives the telco gianttremendous leveragein delivering media content across multiple platforms --   especially if it excludes that content from data charges across   its own networks.Analysts expect AT&T's revenue and  earnings to rise   12% and 5%, respectively, this year. The stock already rallied   22% over the past 12 months, but it remains surprisingly cheap at   17 times earnings -- which is much lower than its industry   average of 25.The mature tech stock: Cisco SystemsCisco Systems is often described as a slow-growth, ""mature""   tech stock. Analysts expect the networking giant's revenue to   fall 2% and its  earnings to rise less than 1% this year due   to tough competition in routers and switches, slower enterprise   spending, and thedisruptive threatof cloud-based networking solutions that require less   hardware.Due to those challenges, Cisco trades at just 15 times   earnings, which is much lower than its industry average of 25.   Its forward yield of 3.5% is also much higher than the market   average, and it's easily supported by a payout ratio of 47%. It   spent 40% of its FCF on those dividends over the past 12 months.   Cisco has hiked its dividend every year since it started paying   one in 2011.Cisco rallied more than 20% over the past 12 months, but those   gains can mainly be attributed to the popularity of dividend   stocks in a low-interest-rate environment instead of any real   enthusiasm for its core business. But looking ahead, Cisco might   rekindle its top-line growth with the robust growth of its   cybersecurity business, the growth of its newly acquired Jasper   Internet of Things (IoT) platform, and additional   acquisitions.The overlooked tobacco play: Reynolds AmericanTobacco stocks are often considered solid income investments,   but some investors only focus on the two former halves of the   Philip Morris empire --AltriaandPhilip Morris International. Altria is a good domestic play, but its price-to-earnings ratio   (P/E) of 25 is higher than the industry average of 22. Meanwhile,   PMI's all-overseas business is too exposed to the strong   dollar.A better play is Reynolds American, which became the   second-largest domestic cigarette maker after it acquired   Lorillard last year. Reynolds trades at just 15 times earnings   and generates most of its revenue in the United States. Reynolds'   flagship Camel brand counters Altria's Marlboro. The company also   dominates the menthol market with Newport, leads the e-cigarette   market with Vuse, and controls the ""additive-free"" niche with   Natural American Spirit.Reynolds pays a forward yield of 3.3%, which is supported by a   payout ratio of 44%. Its dividend payments have eclipsed its free   cash flow (FCF) over the past year due to the Lorillard   acquisition, but that payout ratio should drop to manageable   levels as its FCF grows again. Reynolds has raised its dividend   annually for seven straight years.Analysts expect Reynolds to post 4% sales growth and 11%   earnings growth next year -- which tops Altria's projected sales   growth of 2% and earnings growth of 10%. Reynolds could   eventually be hurt by declining smoking rates, but it can likely   raise prices, cut costs, and repurchase stock to boost its   earnings for years to come.The bottom lineThere's no perfect dividend stock that can be bought and   forgotten about, but AT&T, Cisco, and Reynolds American won't   cause you to lose much sleep. All three stocks trade at discounts   to their industry peers, have hiked their dividends for years,   and have manageable payout ratios. I personally own shares of all   three stocks and haven't ever felt compelled to babysit them.10 stocks we like better than AT and TWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Stocks With Bigger Dividends Than ExxonMobil;1/13/2017;"Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image   source: Getty Images.ExxonMobil Corporation(NYSE: XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing   its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are   plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies,   particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We   reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to   write about some companies with bigger dividends than   ExxonMobil.They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas   logistics specialistHolly Energy Partners L.P.(NYSE: HEP) , tech stalwartCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) , telecom and media giantVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE: VZ) , pharma blue chipPfizer Inc.(NYSE: PFE) , and healthcare real estate upstartCaretrust REIT Inc.(NASDAQ: CTRE) . Keep reading to find out which of these   companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock   portfolio.makeArticleAd();Little company, big dividendTyler Crowe(Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in   ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades   ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of   the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's   one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield   than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that   can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm   the market can throw at it and even give room for growth.Image source: Getty Images.One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that   over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy   Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other   transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with   its contract structures and management's prudent approach to   growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100%   fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from   its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the   commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry.   Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a   manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases.   The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive   quarter in which management raised its payout.With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising   its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking   for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a   look at Holly Energy Partners.A dominant tech companyTim Green(Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its   dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's   quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the   most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about   3.45%.Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just     traditional tech applications.Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets,   although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has   been investing in growth businesses such as security and   collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent   quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth   may take a while.The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a   tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4   billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on   this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow   the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors   shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few   years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and   the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco   a good choice for dividend investors.A low-risk telecom giantSteve Symington(Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past   decade,Verizon stockoffers an attractive mix between stability and growth   potential.Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time   finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets.   Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline   business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9%   year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01,   respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer   loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past   six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments   in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only   become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the   first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in   the United States.Image source: Getty Images.Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying   renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8   billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet   connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections.Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position   itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of   connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to   acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions   company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of   fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics   completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will   take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only   expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long   term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to   allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding   returns to do their work.This drugmaker is a great way to gain exposure to the   high-flying pharma spaceGeorge Budwell(Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a   slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference   between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the   tailwinds facing their respective industries.Image source: Getty Images.The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a   golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and   rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern   healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply   can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that   are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with   the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such   as advanced biofuels and solar.So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its   hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect   of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any   political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem   increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer   treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive   growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's   comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should   not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow   at a fairly regular clip going forward.A small company riding a very big long-term trendJason Hall(Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth   in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on   your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare   facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease   and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in   an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both   underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next   couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population.According to a recent company presentation, there are nearly   10%fewerskilled nursing facilities operating in the U.S. now than there   were 15 years ago, while the over-65 population is growing.   Between 2010 and 2040, the elderly population is expected to more   than double, to over 80 million Americans. Caretrust is very   likely to be a major beneficiary of that growth, as the company   builds and acquires more and more facilities to house and care   for this aging population.With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small   fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can   continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a   portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years.10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print Money;1/12/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHistory has taught us that dividend growth stocks are the absolute best way to grow both your income and wealth over time.Source: StockSnap.ioOne such group of dividend stocks is known as the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats -S&P 500companies that have increased their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Aristocrats havecollectively outperformed the S&P 500over time with less volatility.makeArticleAd();Of course, to be able to pay secure and growing dividends, a company needs to have a strong competitive advantage that gives it good pricing power and allows it to generate strong free cash flow.Today, we're going to look at 10 great dividend growth stocks worth investigating. These are companies with strong businesses that consistently generate rivers of FCF that allow them to reward long-term dividend lovers. Each of these companies also scores well using our Dividend Safety Scores, which income investors canlearn more about here.The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017Here they are, in order of free cash flow margin:Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA)Source:Open Grid Scheduler (Modified)Dividend Yield:4%FCF Margin:22.7%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:8%Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) is one of the world's largest generic drug makers. Its fully integrated production capabilities make it one of the few generics makers that can replicate complex molecules and even biosimilars - one of the most promising sectors in the pharma industry.Better yet, some short-term troubles - including a slower-than-anticipated integration ofAllergan's(NYSE:AGN) generic drug division Actavis, which Teva recently bought for$40.5 billion- has resulted in lowered guidance and the market overreacting by selling off Teva's shares to the tune of 45% in the past year.This has created an appealing long-term buying opportunity.Synergies from Actavis are expected to amount to $1.4 billion. Plus, Teva should achieve another $2 billion in ongoing cost cutting efforts set to boost the company's already high FCF margin.That should spell great news for dividend lovers, who already enjoy a generous and highly secure dividend. Better yet, with a low FCF payout ratio of just 31.2%, Teva has plenty of room to continue growing its payout at a solid clip as it continues its efforts to expand its market share in both developed and emerging markets.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: ShutterstockDividend Yield:3.5%FCF Margin:25.3%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:27%Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) is the world's dominant enterprise telecom equipment provider, with a massive installed base that creates high switching costs and allows it to generate substantially more revenue per unit of equipment sold than rivals such asHP Inc(NYSE:HPQ).And while the telecom industry is moving away from hardware and toward a cloud and software service based future, Cisco is investing heavily into these areas as well, and setting itself up to be a dominant provider in data centers, cloud computing, the internet of things and cyber security.This has resulted in a steadily rising proportion of CSCO's sales coming from high-margin recurring revenue streams. This should allow Cisco to offset the secular decline in its core hardware business.In the meantime, aggressive cost cutting efforts have allowed Cisco to continue growing free cash flow, which combined with steady buybacks, has resulted in continued growth of FCF per share and a low payout ratio of just 40.3%.10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy in     2017That's despite years of very fast dividend growth that is likely to continue for many more years, as Cisco transitions from a fast-growing tech stock to anexcellent dividend growth core holding.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Philip Morris International (PM)Source:Taber Andrew Bain Via FlickrDividend Yield:4.6%FCF Margin:25.8%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:8%Philip Morris International Inc.(NYSE:PM) holds all the international rights to sell dominant cigarette brands such as Marlboro, and this gives it a wide moat with plenty of pricing power to offset the gradual declines in cigarette volumes over time.In fact, in the past year, PM was able to increase the price of its products by a very impressive 5%, resulting in constant currency EPS growth of 18%.Better yet, Philip Morris is finding great success in its smokeless tobacco product, iQOS, in which tobacco is heated but not burned. That should provide PM with solid continued long-term growth potential as global consumers migrate away from cigarettes and towards electronic alternatives.And with massive economies of scale, and ongoing cost cutting efforts Philip Morris International should be able to maintain its exceptional margins, including operating margins in the low to mid-40% range.Combined with a low-capital-intensive business model, PM generates exceptional FCF per share that makes the current generous dividend not just highly secure, but likely to keep growing steadily in the years to come.Philip Morris' high yield makes it a favorite holding forinvestors living off dividends in retirement.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM)Source:Maurizio Pesce Via FlickrDividend Yield:3.2%FCF Margin:29.1%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:20%RecentlyQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) has suffered some regulatory setbacks regarding its IP royalty rights in South Korea and China. However, given its dominant position in both 3G and 4G telecom chip design, the company maintains a nice moat that should result in slow but steady, high-margin revenue growth in the coming years as global smartphone sales continue expanding.Meanwhile, the recent acquisition ofNXP Semiconductorrepresents an excellent long-term investment that should allow Qualcomm to become a dominant player in the fast-growing internet of things, as well as the automotive sector and secured payment industry.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017In the meantime, Qualcomm's growing river of free cash flow is being put to work on aggressive share buybacks (4.3% CAGR share reduction over the past five years), that combined with its low FCF payout ratio of 43.6% should allow QCOM to continue delivering solid double-digit dividend growthQCOM isn't just a solid core dividend growth stock. It's likely to be astrong market beater in the coming decade.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Texas Instruments (TXN)Source:VEX Robotics via FlickrDividend Yield:2.7%FCF Margin:29.5%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:24%Texas Instruments Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN) is the world's largest maker of analog chips, which allow electronics to measure real world conditions such as temperature, pressure and volume, and convert it into digital signals understood by computers.Texas Instrument's amazing FCF margin is courtesy of a truly sweet spot in its high-fragmented industry. The company's strong IP and reputation for reliability give it strong pricing power. However, because analog chips are an integral component in most electronics, but also not that expensive in the first place, manufacturers don't have much incentive to go with lower-priced, but less advanced competitors.This allows TI to prolong the lifecycle of its chips, meaning it can amortize the cost of R&D over a longer time period, and boost margins. Since TXN has in recent years been able to buy worldwide manufacturing equipment from bankrupt rivals for pennies on the dollar, Texas Instruments has been able to generate margins and returns on capital that are50% to 100%better than its rivals.Those rich margins create strong cash flows. Management, in turn, aggressively returns cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. But thanks to a low FCF payout ratio of 39.6%, TXN boasts arock-solid dividendthat is likely to continue growing at 10% for the next decade, generating impressive total returns of about 12% to 13%.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Johannes Marliem Via FlickrDividend Yield:2.5%FCF Margin:31.4%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:17%Under Satya Nadella,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has made great strides in becoming far more than just an old tech dinosaur that's coasting along on the fading glory of its dominant position in PC operating systems.Specifically, the company's Azure cloud platform has secured a solid second place behindAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services offering. In the most recent quarter, it saw incredible 121% year-over-year revenue growth.Better yet, Microsoft's Office 365 subscription service is also doing very well, (54% growth). And its Dynamics and Cloud services businesses are also growing at a solid 13% clip.Combined with its recent acquisition ofLinkedIn, which potentially promises to become afree cash flow monsterfor the company, Microsoft has a solid cash growth runway ahead of it. And with a low FCF payout ratio of just 42.2%, MSFT's very safe dividend should continue growing nicely in the coming years.10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second     WindThus, Microsoft should generate market-beating total returns - even at today's near-record share prices.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Bank of America (BAC)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrDividend Yield:1.3%FCF Margin:38.3%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:44%The great financial crisis of 2008-09 nearly wiped outBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) the company. However, under CEO Brian Moynihan, BofA has undergone one of the single greatest turnarounds in corporate American history.Speculative and money losing divisions have been sold off, lending standards have been tightened toamong the most conservative in the industryand management has shown a laser focus on creating a fortress-like balance sheet. So Bank of America might not be impervious to any future economic downturn, but it's certainly far better shielded than most.Best of all, BAC has delivered billions in cost cutting efforts that have allowed it to greatly increase both earnings and tangible book value per share despite the lowest interest rates in history. And with rates now heading higher, Bank of America has numerous tailwinds at its back to help power phenomenal EPS and dividend growth.Specifically, management still has $3.3 billion in cost cutting planned. Meanwhile, Trump's promised corporate tax cuts and bank deregulation should add $3.2 billion to the annual bottom line, and BofA could see $5.3 billion in additional profits per 100-basis-point increase in interest rates.Bank of America couldpotentially see its dividend increase nearly 10-fold in just the next five years.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: TD Ameritrade (AMTD)Source:Rich via FlickrDividend Yield:1.6%FCF Margin:41.6%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:27%TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.(NASDAQ:AMTD) is one of America's largest discount brokers, but thanks to its relationship with Canadian banking giantToronto-Dominion Bank(NYSE:TD), it has a major competitive advantage.That's because the cash that its clients aren't using at the moment can be used by Toronto-Dominion to provide low-cost funding via its deposit-insured account product. This means the brokerage gains access to interest-rate-sensitive bank-like revenue but doesn't actually have to hold reserves against it.In addition, TD Ameritrade's 6.5 million clients are typically above-average in trading volume (16 trades per year). When combined with the synergistic cost savings from its upcomingScottradeacquisition (as well as rising profits from higher interest rates on its float), this should mean ongoing high-margin growth in the coming years.The 10 Best Low-Cost Index Funds to Buy NowConsistent share buybacks (1.5% CAGR over the past five years) support a rock-bottom 26.6% FCF payout ratio.

Thanks to its exclusive focus on high end, and luxury malls, CEO David Simon has been able to not just survive the rise of online retail, but thrive despite it.Specifically this industry veteran has been able to anchor the REIT's properties, (located in North America, Europe, and Asia) with top end retailers and extract impressive annual rent increases while still maintaining an impressive 96.3% occupancy rate. Better yet, the company is able to invest new shareholder capital into highly profitable endeavors with cash yields as high as 10%, (excellent in today's overheated real estate market).And despite reporting strong 6.8% growth in funds from operations this year, Simon Property Group is trading at near its 52 week low, thanks to the market's overreaction to rising interest rates. SPG boasts a highly secure dividend that's nearly covered by its cash flow twice over. The company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO the REIT equivalent of free cash flow, and what funds the dividend) payout ratio of 61.1% isverylow for a REIT. So, Simon Property Group is well on its way to delivering 6% to 7% dividend growth over the next decade.Combined with its low volatility (beta of 0.62), Simon Property Group couldeasily achieve some of the best risk-adjusted total returnsof any dividend growth stock in America (about 16.5%) over the next decade.Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy: Public Storage (PSA)Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrDividend Yield:3.7%FCF Margin:58.2%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth:15%Public Storage(NYSE:PSA) is America's largest storage unit REIT. It was founded in 1972, and now owns more than 2,500 properties in 38 states and seven European countries, serving over 1 million customers.The great thing about this REIT, though, is that despite its enormous size, (which makes for very consistent cash flow to protect the fast growing dividend), there is plenty of growth runway ahead of it. That's because the U.S. storage industry is incredibly fragmented, with Public Storage owning just 6% of the total market share in America.That doesn't stop management from turning its competitive advantages - namely its commanding lead in fast-growing markets such as the West Coast, Texas and Florida into a massive free cash flow machine.This is courtesy of the month-to-month nature of the contracts PSA signs with customers, which allow it to consistently raise rents, and maximize margins and returns on shareholder capital.Better yet, with a low 72.8% AFFO payout ratio, this is one of the most secure dividends in all of REIT-dom.

Should I Buy FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;1/12/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCybersecurity stocks have taken a hit over the past few years, but there has been one company that has made that bearishness look downright placid -FireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE).Source:David via Flickr (Modified)FEYE stock has lost value for the past three years, and now trades a long way from its all-time high of $85 in early 2014.makeArticleAd();Indeed, FEYE has many issues. There's the drastic slowdown in sales, the abrupt departure of the CEO last year and, of course, the intense competitive environment. Not the least of which is FireEye's meandering transition to the cloud and its hesitancy to adopt next-generation technologies.In light of all this, is it any wonder that FEYE stock has been so terrible? Nope.But when it comes to investing, there are often nice opportunities with contrarian plays. So might this be the case with FireEye stock? Well, to see, let's take a look at three pros and three cons:FEYE Stock ProsStill a Solid Company:It does seem overblown that FEYE stock is headed for near oblivion. The fact is that the company still has an impressive business, with a wide array of products and services. In the latest quarter, FEYE added287 new customersand there were 47 that entered into transactions in excess of $1 million. The total customer account is over 5,000 and more than 940 are on the Forbes Global 2000. As for revenues, they came to $186.4 million in the most recent quarter. In all, there is $926.2 million in the bank. Consider that the market cap of FEYE stock is only about $2.2 billion.Strong Leadership:CEO Kevin Mandia has wasted little time in making serious restructuring efforts. Then again, he is one of the top influencers in the cybersecurity industry. Hestarted his career in the United States Air Forceas a security officer and then as a cybercrime investigator in the Air Force Office of Special Investigation. After these stints, he went into the private sector, having worked at various firms like Sytex, and also co-authored two well-regarded books. Then he went on to launch Mandiant in 2004, eventuallyselling the company to FireEyein 2014.10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second     WindIn other words, Mandia has a rare blend of deep experience with the technical aspects of cybersecurity and also how to build successful companies. So regarding the product line, a key part of his strategy is to offer more affordable solutions so as to cater to smaller customers. To this end, FEYE has launched FireEye Essentials. But, of course, another high priority is the cloud, which is part of the FireEye as a Service (FaaS) platform. Some of the recent product launches for this include Cloud MVX - which does not require a hardware appliance and is priced on a subscription basis - and MVX Smart Grid (this is for those companies that prefer on-premise approaches, such as in industries like financial services and healthcare).Then there are other important tools like the FireEye Security Orchestrator, which manages threats and responses across massive organizations. As a testament to its power, a government agency made a seven-figure purchase of the software during thelatest quarter.Secular Trends:More than ever, we rely on core technologies that are becoming essential to everyday living. No doubt, there is the ubiquity of smartphones and wearables. But with the Internet of Things, there is the growth in technology for autos, homes and even medical devices. Protecting these systems from cyberattacks is only getting more complicated. As a result, the growth for the industry is likely to remain strong for the long haul. According to a report fromIDC, the global spending is expected to jump from $73.7 billion in 2016 to $101.6 billion by 2020.FEYE Stock ConsGrowth Issues:The deceleration of the top line has certainly been dramatic. During the first quarter of 2015, revenues soared by69% to $125.4 million. Yet for the latest earnings report, there was only a 13% gain. Keep in mind that FEYE expects the situation to get even worse. The guidance for the fourth quarter is for revenues of $187 million to $193 million, which would translate to an increase of1.2% to 4.4%. It's important to note that a big part of the reduction has come from the transition to a subscription business model, which means not as much revenue can be recognized up front. Despite this, there is little doubt that FEYE has been losing momentum. That's why the company has focused on restructuring its operations.Competition:It's intense for the cybersecurity market. Just some of the top operators includeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW),Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP) andProofpoint Inc(NASDAQ:PFPT). But some mega tech companies have also moved aggressively into the space, such asCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO). But perhaps the biggest threat is from the startups, which have the benefit of a flush venture capital market. The fact is that a technology lead can easily disappear - and it can be very tough to regain it. A prime example of this isSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC), which relied too long on its antivirus franchise and did not make enough investments to refresh its product offering.Losses:FEYE has been a consistent money loser. True, this is fairly common throughout the cybersecurity industry. But then again,  losses become much more of a problem when sales are rapidly falling! Unfortunately, there are no signs that FEYE will hit profitability anytime soon. For the current quarter, analysts expect a net loss of 16 cents a share. The company has made progress with reducing costs, yet asInvestorPlace Media'sJames Brumelynoted recently: ""… an even closer inspection reveals that relative improvement almost entirely came from the $10.7 million reduction in R&D spending - a cost cut that may come back to haunt the company in the long run.""Bottom Line on FEYE StockTech turnarounds are always difficult, and many fail. But again, FEYE has a CEO with a strong background and is making smart decisions. Actually, the company is already starting to see positive results.FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Hit A Bottom ... But     Not THE BottomBesides, the valuation is fairly reasonable. Consider that FEYE stock trades at about three times its sales. By comparison, both PANW andCyberark Software Ltd(NASDAQ:CYBR) sport multiples of about eight times sales.OK then, should you buy FEYE stock now?  I think so, given that it looks like a good value play on a growth industry.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you   canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Will Cisco Systems Raise Its Dividend in 2017?;1/11/2017;"Technology stocks used to be stingy with their capital, butCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) is proof of how much the tech industry has changed   when it comes to dividends. Cisco paid its first dividend just   six years ago, but since then, it has grown its quarterly payment   so much that the networking giant is now among the top dividend   paying stocks in theDow Jones Industrialsin terms of yield. Looking forward, income investors want to know   if they can count on Cisco to continue its streak of rewarding   shareholders with higher dividends. Let's take a closer look at   Cisco Systems to see whether it will raise its dividend in   2017.Image source: Cisco Systems.Dividend stats on Cisco SystemsCurrent Quarterly Dividend Per SharemakeArticleAd();$0.26Current Yield3.4%Number of Consecutive Years With Dividend             Increases6 yearsPayout Ratio47%Last IncreaseApril 2016Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Last increase refers to   ex-dividend date.How Cisco became a dividend giantCisco's history of paying dividends is short but sweet. In   2011, the networking giant declared a $0.06-per-share quarterly   dividend. Then-CFO Frank Calderoni told investors, ""Cisco's   leadership position in the markets we serve is strong, and the   time is right for Cisco to pay our first-ever cash dividend."" The   payout gave Cisco a modest dividend yield at the time of   1.4%.Yet Cisco wasn't content for very long with simply paying a   dividend. The following year, the company gave investors a 33%   increase in April, and then came back with a whopping 75% boost   in October. The second increase was part of Cisco's broader   capital management strategy, which stated the company's intention   to return half of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form   of dividends and stock repurchases combined. Moreover, then-CEO   John Chambers said, ""We wanted to get the dividend to allow both   that the shareholders clearly understood we're committed to it,   and if we do our job right, at the right times, we're committed   to raising it.""CSCO dividenddata byYCharts.Since then, Cisco has followed through on its commitment to   make the dividend an increasingly important part of its total   return for shareholders. Three double-digit percentage dividend   hikes followed in consecutive years, and the most recent increase   came to 24%. Current CEO Chuck Robbins told investors after that   boost, ""We have a tremendous amount of confidence in our business   long term, [and] we heard from many of our shareholders that they   wanted to see us get more aggressive with the dividend   returns.""Yet even with the big increases in dividends, Cisco hasn't   overextended itself. Dividend payouts make up just over half of   Cisco's earnings right now. If the company can sustain its growth   rates going forward, then there should be more opportunities for   the networking giant to make further increases.Will Cisco raise its dividend in 2017?One outstanding issue that could spur another increase in   Cisco's capital return to shareholders is whether tax reform will   reduce the amount of tax that the tech giant would have to pay to   repatriate profits from overseas. As Robbins told investors in   December, ""If we're able to bring those funds back to the U.S.,   then we would look at a combination of the options of dividends,   buybacks, and M&A activity.""Yet it wouldn't take favorable movement on repatriation to   allow Cisco to make a further increase. Stock buybacks have   reduced Cisco's share count over the years, and that permits the   company to make dividend increases without boosting the total   amount of cash it's paying to shareholders.Overall, the odds are good that Cisco will raise its dividend   in 2017. There's a chance that the company could wait until later   in the year than its usual March-April time frame in order to   give lawmakers time to consider a tax reform package that could   include repatriation provisions. However, what's more likely is   that investors will get a roughly 12% increase to $0.29 per share   early in the year, with a possible further increase if things in   Washington go well. Regardless, Cisco's total return of nearly   25% over the past year has kept long-term shareholders happy, and   its growth prospects remain solid, offering future support for   future dividend increases in 2017 and beyond.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Barrick Gold Doubled in 2016. Will It Soar Even Higher in 2017?;1/11/2017;"With prices rising as much as 21% last August, gold looked   like it was bouncing back last year from the slide that it has   endured since 2013. Donald Trump's election put an end to that,   though -- from the election to the end of December, theprice of   goldfell nearly 11%.In the midst of this volatility, however, shares ofBarrick Gold(NYSE: ABX) , a global leader among gold stocks, climbed more   than 106%. Let's dig into the company's performance in 2016, and   see what we can expect in 2017.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Golden highlightsOne of the company's priorities in 2016 was to streamline its   operations so that it could still produce free cash flow if the   price of gold dipped to $1,000 per ounce. Though the company   hasn't reported its Q4 earnings yet, as of Q3, the company   reported that it had exceeded its target, generating free cash   flow at a gold price below $1,000 per ounce.Barrick's skill at keeping its expenses down was partly   responsible for this success. The mining industry's version of   operating expenses -- all-in sustaining costs (AISC) -- provide   good insight into how efficiently a company is operating. And in   this regard, Barrick was quite successful.As of Q3, management estimated that AISC for fiscal 2016 will   total between $740 and $775 per gold ounce. By comparison,NewmontMining(NYSE: NEM) , one of Barrick's leading competitors, has a fiscal   2016 AISC estimate of $870 to $930 per gold ounce.Because digging the yellow stuff out of the ground doesn't   come cheaply, mining companies often rely on debt to keep the   shovels shoveling. Consequently, a company carrying a heavy debt   load can quickly find itself in trouble if the price of gold   falls too far.Barrick Gold's management, which is sensitive to this, has   committed to a medium-term debt-reduction strategy of lowering   its total debt by $5 billion from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2017.   Barrick reduced debt by $3 billion in 2015, which led to a   debt-reduction target of $2 billion in 2016. And as of Q3, it had   achieved 71% of that target. Moreover, on the Q3 conference call,   management reported that it was ""tracking well"" to the yearly   target.Growth catalysts in 2017Turning toward the new year, we don't find any singular events   that will affect the company's performance. One initiative that   will be worth following, however, is the company's work withCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) . John L. Thornton, Barrick's executive chairman,   recognizes the partnership has tremendous potential.In the press release, he states, ""Harnessing the potential of   digital technology will unlock value across our business, helping   us grow our free cash flow per share."" And in 2017, the two   companies will work to develop Barrick's Cortez mine -- one of   Barrick's core mines in Nevada -- into Barrick's ""flagship   digital operation."" Though progress at Cortez will not have a   profound effect in 2017, it will be an auspicious sign that   further successes await as other mines are digitized -- successes   that will, in time, result in larger financial gains.Besides monitoring progress with Cisco, investors can watch   for Barrick's success in achieving its financial targets.   Arguably, the strong performance of Barrick's stock was a result   of the company's strong performance in strengthening both its   balance sheet and cash flow.Image source: Barrick Gold.As a result, continued success in shoring up the balance sheet   and improving cash flow may translate to a rise in shares. For   example, in its Investor Day presentation from February,   management forecasted gold production to total between 5.0   million and 5.5 million ounces of gold. In addition, management   estimated AISC to total between $740 and $790 per gold ounce.A golden valuation?We've looked at what's behind Barrick and what's ahead, so   let's turn our attention now to its stock. Since the company   hasn't reported positive net income since 2011, the traditional   price-to-earnings ratio won't provide much insight. Instead,   let's consider the stock in terms of its  free cash flow on   a trailing-12-month basis.Over the past year, the stock has traded as low as 8.5 times   free cash flow and as high as 17.0 times free cash flow.   Currently, shares are trading at about 13 times free cash flow --   almost exactly the midpoint of its range over the past year. This   suggests that shares are reasonably priced.Considering only one valuation metric seems inadequate to   properly gauge the stock, so let's also look at it's   price-to-sales ratio on a trailing-12-month basis. Trading at   about 2.3 times sales, shares seem to be a little bit higher than   the midpoint of its high and low for the year -- but not by   much.ABX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYCharts.To provide more context for the stock's valuation, let's   consider it alongside its peers:Goldcorp,Kinross Gold, Newmont Mining, andYamana Gold. In terms of free cash flow, Barrick's valuation certainly seems   fair. Although it may seem a little pricier than its peers, the   stock's valuation in terms of sales doesn't raise any red   flags.ABX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYCharts.Overall, considering where shares are trading today, the stock   seems fairly priced.The takeawayAlthough shares of Barrick Gold had a great run in 2016,   there's no guarantee that it will continue into 2017. At this   point, in fact, it seems that Wall Street has gotten this one   right by not baking in too many expectations, or punishing it   unfairly. With its eyes on the future -- a digitized future --   and a circumspect approach to managing its debt, Barrick Gold is   a reasonable consideration for investors looking to gain exposure   to the gold industry.10 stocks we like better than Barrick GoldWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Cisco Systems?;1/10/2017;"AtHoldings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 24 most recent 13F filings for the 12/31/2016 reporting period, and noticed that Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) was held by 18 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose theirlongpositions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose theirshortpositions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the storybecause the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.makeArticleAd();Having given that caveat, we believe that looking atgroupsof 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in CSCO positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:FundNew Position?Change In Share CountChange In Market Value($ in 1000's)Robecosam AGExisting+17,185+$249First Financial Corp INExisting-2,540-$99Founders Financial Securities LLCExisting-445-$58Cardinal Capital Management Inc.Existing+18,184-$64Country Club Trust Company n.a.Existing+4,702-$717Ipswich Investment Management Co.

We then compared that number to the sum total of CSCO shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for CSCO. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 5,361 shares in the aggregate, from 19,341,405 up to 19,346,766 for a share count increase of approximately 0.03%.

Ericsson, Cisco to Revamp Telefonica Guatemala's Network;1/10/2017;"Communications technology and services provider,Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ)ERIC, and its partner Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCO, have joined hands to develop a modern, IP-based network - Internet Protocol (IP) network - for Telefonica Guatemala.Telefonica Guatemala will make use of Ericsson's integration services and Cisco's I Cisco ASR 9010 and ASR 1001 routers, in order to support the rising demand of high-speed broadband from its seven million customers in the country. Guatemala is the first country in Central America, which had introduced 3G services in 2008, with its subscribers' base currently skyrocketing to 3.2 million.In particular, Telefonica will be able to enjoy services like Ethernet services, VPNs, and IPv6, leveraging on Ericsson and Cisco's technical knowhow. This network revamp will further facilitate future network requirements, based on the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and cloud implementations.The Ericsson-Cisco CollaborationEricsson and Cisco's collaboration dates back to Nov 2015, with the communications technology behemoths inking a global business and technology partnership to create futuristic networks. The Ericsson-Cisco duo extends routing, data center, networking, cloud, mobility, management and control, and global services capabilities to clients across the globe.It appears that this collaboration is shaping up well, with the companies jointly bagging more than 60 deals in IP (routing and transport) and services. At present, they enjoy 250 active customer engagements and remain optimistic that these will lead to lucrative award wins, going forward. After having announced deals with Vodafone Portugal, Aster Dominican Republic and Cable & Wireless in 2016, most recently the Ericsson-Cisco team has also been cleared by Brazilian regulatory authorities.Ericsson Shows Signs of Slumping FurtherDespite forging of strategic partnerships and having a dominant presence in high-traffic LTE markets, Ericsson had a disastrous run on the bourse in 2016. Ericsson's shares registered a plunge of 23.8%, over the past one year, much wider than the Zacks classifiedWireless Equipmentindustry's average negative return of 2.4%. Soft mobile broadband demand, slowdown in emerging markets and weaker-than-expected benefits from cost-cutting initiatives have hampered the company's growth significantly.With three back-to-back earnings misses, over the trailing four quarters, Ericsson has an unimpressive average negative earnings surprise of 23.0%. Further, with the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock's earnings estimates moving south, over the past couple of months, the situation turns more grim. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings descended from 41 cents to 33 cents, over the past two months. This is attributable to two downward estimate revisions compared with none upward.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space Exa Corp.EXAand Harris CorporationHRS.

Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Is Headed to $30;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTrendy athletic apparel makerUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UA) took a beating following its last quarterly earnings report. In fact, UA stock is down more than 20% since late October. But Under Armour shares are showing signs of life lately, and with plenty of room for growth on the sentiment front, UA stock could be in for a comeback rally.Source:SandyDover via Flickr (Modified)Let's preface this with the fact that we are looking for short-term gains heading into Under Armour's quarterly report - slated for release the week after January 2017 options expire.makeArticleAd();The company is still bouncing back from losing its largest seller,Sports Authority, and will continue to readjust to the shift away from the ""athlesiure"" trend.In other words, guidance is uncertain and has the potential to bring about a post-earnings sell-off.That said, UA stock has gained some momentum heading into earnings that could result in short-term gains for savvy options traders. Under Armour has bounced off support in the $25 region, and pulled its 20-day and 50-day moving averages into a bullish cross.7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     BankThe only limit to UA stock's upside at the moment lies in the $29-$30 region, which has capped the shares following last quarter's bearish earnings reaction.Click to EnlargeSentiment on UA stock also supports a run heading into earnings. According to data from The Wall Street Journal, Under Armour shares have attracted 15 buys, 20 holds, and one sell rating. On the other hand, the consensus 12-month price target of $44 represents a whopping premium of about 62% to yesterday's close. In other words, there is a high likelihood of UA stock receiving an upgrade or two ahead of earnings to match current expectations.Options traders are heavily bullish on UA stock right now. Currently, the January 2017 put/call ratio rests at 0.43, with calls more than doubling puts among options set to expire this month.What's more, the potential payoff could be big, as implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 6%. This places the upper bound near $29.16, while the lower bound lies at $25.84.2 Trades for Under Armour StockCall Spread:Traders looking to bank on a pre-earnings rally for UA stock might want to consider a January 2017 $27.50/$30 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 45 cents, or $45 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $27.95, while a maximum profit of $2.05, or $205 per pair of contracts, is possible if Under Armour closes at or above $30 when January 2017 options expire.Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Could Gain     30%Put Spread:On the other hand, buying power may begin to fizzle out if the broad-market rally meets with headwinds or analysts fail to pump the shares ahead of earnings. Traders nervous about the lack of buying power for UA stock might consider a January 2017 $25 put sell. At last check, this put was bid at 20 cents, or $20 per contract.As with all put sells, traders will keep the premium received for entering the trade as long as Under Armour trades above $25 through September expiration. If it were to trade below $25 prior to expiration, then you could be assigned 100 shares of UA stock per contract sold at a cost of $25 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy for a Big JanuaryThe 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearThe postUnder Armour Inc (UA) Stock Is Headed to $30appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Could Gain 30%;1/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCompetition in the tech space is fierce, making it difficult for long-term investors to find quality stocks to beef up that aspect of their portfolios. The hottest companies are often the most expensive and those whose share prices are waning could be on their way toward the technology graveyard. However, some solid, reliable firms have been delivering for years that are being overlooked and are therefore undervalued.Source: ShutterstockCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) is one such company. Cisco stock has fallen nearly 4% over the last three months and the firm is poised to have a breakout year - making now a great time to buy.makeArticleAd();Although it's true that CSCO hasfallen prey to rising competitionin the tech space and the firm's efforts to break into new markets like security and software are likely to be riddled with obstacles. Even after taking into account the headwinds facing Cisco stock, the company is undervalued.The firm's forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 12; that's much lower than the rest of the tech industry and sits even further below theS&P 500as a whole. If CSCO stock was priced similarly to the broader market, the stock would be making its way toward the $40 mark.Improvement Ahead for CSCO StockNot only is Cisco stock valued much lower than many of its peers, but the company's plans are pretty impressive as well. CSCO is shifting its focus toward subscription-based services, security and data centers. That means the company is laying the foundation to create a continuous revenue stream through subscription fees. The firm is also inserting itself into some of the fastest growing sectors in the tech space, which is certainly something long-term investors should consider.7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017One of the best reasons to buy and hold Cisco stock is the company's financial strength. The company's balance sheet shows that management is keeping the firm on the right track by controlling inventory effectively and maintaining a healthy cash flow, a good sign that the firm can weather any storms as it makes its transition into new industries.Not only will the firm's financial backbone keep it from capitulating at every bump in the road, but it reassures shareholders that their dividend payments are unlikely to go anywhere.Cisco Stock's Bonus DividendNot only could CSCO stock rise 30% in the coming year, but the company also pays an impressive dividend. While a dividend yield of 3.44% may not sound like much, Cisco's dividend payouts come in on the high end of the spectrum in the tech world. That means that long-term investors are rewarded with a steady income while they wait for a CSCO stock rally.That 3.44% could be on its way up as well. Cisco is one of the firms set to benefit from Donald Trump's plans to reform corporate taxes once he takes office. CSCO is sitting on about$60 billion overseas, all of which could be repatriated if the tax laws are reformed. That money, or at least part of it, is likely to make its way into shareholders' pockets either through buybacks or a dividend hike.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (WMT) Has More Problems     Than the Trump TariffBut, with all of that said, it's not all roses for Cisco stock, the company still has some major obstacles to overcome. The firm issued lackluster Q2 guidance, proving that it is still struggling with its transition from hardware, and many point to the fierce competition in security, data centers and networking where CSCO plans to build its business.Bottom Line on CSCOWhile that is certainly a concern, the troubles Cisco stock is facing are not unlike those plaguing most tech companies today. IT is a crowded space and competition will always be a worry, but CSCO's financial stability and longevity are likely to help the company, and its shareholders, weather any storms along the way.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017The postWhy Cisco Systems, Inc.

Large-Cap Darlings Hit Hard: Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL);1/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT) went on a tremendous tear in the second half of last year, soaring by roughly 20% to make it one of the most crowded large-cap names of last year.makeArticleAd();Unsurprisingly, tech names make up a sizable chunk of the large-cap portion of Credit Suisse's Jan. 4 report and list entitled ""The Darlings ofActive Managers,"" which includes the most crowded names amongsmall-, mid-and large-cap funds in the U.S.Microsoft Tops the Large-Cap ListIt is quite interesting that Microsoft managed to land at the top of the list, even coming out ahead ofApple Inc.(AAPL). According to data from Credit Suisse, 380 large-cap funds held shares of the cloud and IT giant. Despite the large number, it's still six fewer large-cap funds that held Microsoft shares in the second quarter of last year.In second place on the list was Apple; the only surprise here is that Microsoft came out ahead of theiPhone makeron this list.Credit Suisse reports that 374 large-cap funds held Apple shares in the fourth quarter, which is the same number of funds that held them in the second quarter of last year.Three of the Four FANG Names Make the ListCredit Suisse said the third most popular name on their list of large-cap ""darlings"" was Google parent Alphabet, with 358 funds holding its shares during the fourth quarter. The firm said 17 more funds picked up Alphabet shares between the second and fourth quarters of last year.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksAlphabet Inc(GOOGL) wasn't the only one of theFANG stocks(Facebook Inc(FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NFLX) Google/ Alphabet) to make the list.In fact, the only one that wasn't on the list was Netflix, as just 64 large-cap funds held shares of the streaming firm as of the third quarter.

My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings;1/7/2017;"Some investors hold dozens of stocks at any given time, using   diversification as a way to minimize the chance that a single   mistake causes an outsize amount of pain. There's nothing wrong   with that approach, but it tends to dilute one's best ideas with   so-so stocks. As Warren Buffett says, ""Diversification is   protection against ignorance."" If you're not confident in your   best ideas, diversify away.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();I take the opposite approach. ""The way to become rich is to   put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket,""   according to Andrew Carnegie. That's what Buffett has done his   entire career, betting big when the odds were heavily in his   favor and doing nothing when they weren't.The top three holdings in my portfolio,International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andKulicke & Soffa Industries(NASDAQ: KLIC) , account for a little less than 40% of its total   value. I bought each at a price that gave me a substantial margin   of safety, giving me plenty of room to be wrong. My favorite kind   of investment is one where I have to be right about very few   things for it to work out well.A century-old tech companyIBM is my biggest position. The stock has been on a   roller-coaster ride since I first bought shares in late 2014,   dropping considerably in 2015 and then recovering in 2016. I   bought shares a total of eight times as the stock fell, lowering   my cost basis to about $154 per share by the end. A 20% gain in   2016 brought the position back into the black.IBMdata byYChartsIn the case of IBM, a slumping stock price didn't change my   thesis. The market had become extremely pessimistic about IBM's   ability to adapt to a world where cloud computing was   growing in importance. Revenue and profit were slumping as IBM   sold off underperforming businesses and shifted its focus to its   growth businesses. Currency didn't help, with a strengthening   U.S. dollar in 2015 wreaking havoc on the company's international   numbers.IBM has the benefit of a broad base of global customers that   rely on its hardware, software, and services. This doesn't   guarantee that the company will remain relevant forever, but it   does give it time to make the necessary changes. IBM's cloud   business is now booming, bringing in $12.7 billion of revenue   over the past 12 months. Total software revenue isgrowing again, and cognitive computing system Watson will be used, both   directly and indirectly, by more than 1 billion consumers by the   end of 2017.IBM expects to produce at least $13.50 in adjusted earnings   per share in 2016, which is depressed because of its heavy   investments and the continued negative impact of currency. IBM   will need to eventually return to earnings growth for my   investment to reach its full potential, but I'm confident that   thecompany's strategyis the right one.Another big tech companyI've owned shares of networking hardware giant Cisco since   mid-2012, originally paying $16.61 per share. I added to that   position a couple of times, including in early 2016, when the   stock market had a brief but lucrative meltdown. My cost basis   currently sits at $20.40 per share.The stock has surged to around $30 per share since then,   driven mostly by the fact that the market was extremely   pessimistic about Cisco a few years ago. The company's results   have been fine but nothing to write home about. Growth has been   slow, and its core switching and routing businesses have been   volatile. But Cisco continues to dominate those markets.CSCOdata byYChartsCisco is extremely profitable, producing operating margins   around 25%. The company has produced $12.4 billion of free cash   flow over the past 12 months, compared with a market   capitalization of about $150 billion. Back out the $36 billion of   net cash on the balance sheet, and Cisco's cash-adjusted price to   free cash flow ratio is a paltry 9.2.The rise of cloud computing and software-defined networking   has introduced quite a bit of uncertainty. Whether Cisco can   remain as dominant as it is today in its core markets going   forward is an open question. But the pessimistic stock price   gives investors a substantial margin of safety. Cisco doesn't   need to be the growth company it once was for an investment in   the stock to work out well. It just needs to do better than the   market expects. And the market isn't expecting much.An overlooked small-cap stockKulicke & Soffa is not a well-known company. It   manufactures semiconductor packaging equipment, holding a   dominant share of the market for wire bonding equipment.I first wrote about Kulicke & Soffain July 2015, and I bought shares soon after. I bought a few more   times as the stock gyrated, building up a substantial   position.Shares of Kulicke & Soffa have soared since bottoming out   a little over a year ago. The stock is up about 70% from its   52-week low. I sold about one-third of my position late last year   because it had become too big a part of my portfolio, but Kulicke   & Soffa is still my third-largest holding.KLICdata byYChartsKulicke & Soffa's revenue and profit fluctuate along with   demand for its equipment, leading to major swings in both. But   the company has done a good job remaining profitable during the   tough times, only posting one annual net loss in the past decade.   Kulicke & Soffa's balance sheet was a big factor in my   decision to buy the stock in the first place. At the end of the   most recent quarter, the company had $548 million in cash and no   debt. Even after the surge in the stock price, cash still   represents nearly half of Kulicke & Soffa's market   capitalization.Averaging around $50 million in net income annually, albeit   with a lot of variation, Kulicke & Soffa was too cheap to   ignore when it was trading for around $10 per share. It's not   nearly as cheap today, but it's still a solid company trading at   a reasonable price.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

(ATVI)The video game maker saw some strength through October last   year, but failed to get the normal seasonality trend that we see   in it and other toy and video game companies as the holidays   approach.  Instead, ATVI spent the last quarter falling into   a technically bearish trend.Activision shares are right at overbought readings according   to their RSI, which is bad news as ATVI stock is trading just   below its 50-day moving average. The combination of technical   trendline resistance and an overbought reading is dangerous.The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for       2017Traders are likely to take the signal as a reason to sell   Activision shares into the resistance, continuing the   intermediate-term bearish trend that initiated on Nov. 8.    For now, it appears a wise move to sell ATVI into the recent 5%   rally if you already held the shares, or take the short side of   the Activision trade as a price target of $36 or lower is   likely.Hasbro, Inc. (HAS)Unlike ATVI, Hasbro shares did see the seasonal strength of   the holiday shopping season play out as shares of the toy company   rallied for a 14% gain from their October lows to November highs.   Since hitting those highs, HAS stock has seen an increase in   volatility and selling, putting Hasbro shares on the brink of a   intermediate-term sell signal.HAS shares spiked this week shooting the RSI reading for the   stock to near-overbought levels. What appears to be the rally's   last push on Thursday also marked a move above the 50-day   trendline, which is being reversed this morning.A reversal at the 50-day moving average will accelerate the   selling pressure as traders are already reacting to the   short-term overbought readings. Unfortunately, there are more   warnings signs.Hasbro's 50-day moving average is in the process of   transitioning into a bearish pattern as the trend is rolling over   into a declining pattern. Our models indicate that this will   increase the downside risk for HAS stock over the next four   to six weeks and target a move back below $76 and potentially as   low as $72.Moody's Corporation (MCO)With interest rates heading higher there is a chance that   there will be fewer bond issuances in 2017.  Of course, this   is a potential fundamental weakness for Moody's, but the charts   are already revealing some risks to the rating agency.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is More       Attractive Than You ThinkSince October, MCO shares have been trading in a new   bearish trend. Moody's stock hit highs in September and then   reversed as it became clear that the Federal Reserve was heading   towards an interest rate hike.Today, Moody's shares are experiencing overhead pressure from   their declining 50-day moving average. This is the first time   that MCO stock has experienced this pressure since rolling   over in October, so the traders will use the reaction as a litmus   test for the next two to three months of trading, barring any   blowout earnings results or outlooks.In addition, Moody's shares are seeing pressure from their   longer-term, 20-month moving average, which is ""trading"" at   $99.88. This trendline marks the difference between a technical   bull and bear market for MCO stock and will not be an easy mark   for the shares to move above.Given the short- and long-term implications of the current   price level, Moody's shares should be considered a dangerous hold   for investors and a potential shorting opportunity for the   aggressive traders.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 of the Worst Values on Wall StreetThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' PicksThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Activision   Blizzard, Inc.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is More Attractive Than You Think;1/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's no longer a real secret thatCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) is on the defensive in the router/switching market - a market that thrust Cisco to the head of the class in the late 90's, and a market that Cisco still mostly dominates. On the flipside, investors more than a little familiar with CSCO stock also know the company's newest priority isn't the kind of heavy-hitting revenue generator its networking wares used to be.Source: ShutterstockThat new focus? Software, and the Internet of Things in particular … a party to which Cisco showed up late, and an arena that it still doesn't look like it's perfectly ready to compete in compared to other players likeGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE).makeArticleAd();Fear not, however. Not only is Cisco equipped well enough to remain relevant in a future where IoT is everything, some subtle clues recently dished out by key executives suggests the company ""gets it"" to a far greater degree than anyone's giving it credit for.CSCO Picks the Low-Hanging FruitThink Cisco has already missed the Internet of Things boat? Cisco stock holders need not worry.Maciej Kranz isn't exactly a name that rings a bell among owners of CSCO owners. But, as Vice President of the company's Corporate Technology Group, he's well positioned - perhaps more so than some higher-level executives - to determine how Cisco gets from point A to point B.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksAnd Kranz has an amazingly pragmatic view of where Cisco fits in the still-nascent IoT market.In a corporate blog post penned in early December,Kranz opined:""Successful IoT deployments do have at least one thing in common, however - they focus on solving the customer's real business problems.This third ingredient in my Recipe for IoT Success may seem obvious to you. Of course you focus on real problems! But you may be surprised at how often these efforts wander off track because someone is chasing a shiny new technology instead of starting with the customer - and the customer's problems - at the center.""It isn't sexy. That's the point. It's marketable. Rather than swinging for the fences (and risking a whiff), Cisco is gunning to hit singles and maybe the occasional double to secure its place in the Internet of Things market.With just a cursory glance at what Cisco has done thus far, and plans to do, owners of CSCO stock might not see such a practical bent to its efforts. Take a closer look though, beginning with Cisco's answer to the need for Low Power Wireless Access hardware.It wasn't much of a consideration in the early era of IoT, but a great number of ""connected"" devices don't need to frequently communicate with a network. They need tocommunicate infrequently, but reliably, sending a modest amount of data from remote locations. Water and gas meters are a couple of examples. Such devices require a new engineering model that allows for their nuances. Cisco's solution, called LoRaWAN, provides a real solution to a problem many IoT operators didn't foresee.Cisco has already deployed some commercializedLoRaWansolutions, but has only scratched the surface of this market.The company has also began the development of so-called ""fog"" computing solutions.While the advent of cloud computing has been game-changing for the world, the cloud has already put enormous strain on cellular and wi-fi networks, gobbling up bandwidth that simply won't be available in the foreseeable future. Yet, to halt such digital communication would be a step in the wrong direction.Boring Is Good for AT&T Inc. (T) StockThere is a happy medium. Rather than wirelessly delivering every last shred of data available and processing it at a centralized location, why not handle some of that data-processing before needlessly uploading …everything? Such an approach will not only pre-solve many bandwidth/capacity problems, but may actually result in greater efficiency since data is processed at the same locale where it's put into action.Cisco is already deploying this sort ofsolutiontoo.Bottom Line for Cisco StockAs was noted, neither of these highly-marketable initiatives (or any of the other unmentioned ones) are sexy by any stretch of the imagination. Indeed, the average consumer - and average investor - may not even realize these sorts of technological challenges exist, or are being addressed. They're out there though, and while some companies are looking to develop products that create paradigm shifts, Cisco is quietly focused on coming up with solutions that are quickly becoming indispensable.CSCO stock remains one of the market's better picks, largely because the company knows exactly what the future holds and it's not wasting time on hunting a whale it may never find. Oh, and the 3.4% Cisco dividend yield doesn't hurt its appeal either.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Won't Be Around a Year From     Now7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50%     Upside in 2017The postCisco Systems, Inc.

2 Top Stocks That Are Cash Cows;1/5/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Tech titansOracle Corporation(NYSE: ORCL) andCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) are cheap on a price-to-earnings basis and they   generate buckets of free cash flow (FCF). Their FCF generation   combined is about as much as the GDP of Uganda's 38   million people. Even if all they did was grow earnings and FCF in   line with inflation, they would be raging buys. But, of course,   investing is rarely this simple, so let's take a look at what you   need to know before deciding whether to buy these large-cap cash   cows.makeArticleAd();The value propositionAs you can see in the table below, both have attractive   FCF-to-enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) multiples. In   plain English, this means that Cisco Systems is currently   generating more than 10% of its market cap in FCF, while Oracle   clocks in around 8%.  H owever, as is often the case with   cash cow stocks, revenue growth is low.However, both have good return on invested capital (net income   after tax divided by invested capital), a useful measure because   an increasing ROIC suggests a company can increase FCF in the   future even if revenue and earnings are flat. Declining ROIC is a   warning sign.CompanyFCF/EV5-Year Average Revenue GrowthReturn on Invested Capital*FCF/Sales*Oracle8.1%0.8%10%33.6%Cisco10.7%2.7%11.3%25.3%Data source: Company accounts. Table by author. *Last 12   months.In short, they are classic low-growth but cheap cash cow   stocks. Is it time to buy? Not so fast -- these types of stocks   can be value traps out to catch an unsuspecting investor. Let's   look closer at them.Oracle analysisBoth companies have threats/opportunities from the cloud, but   Oracle is arguably better placed to address them. Oracle's   challenge/opportunity in the next few years is to:Replace its declining hardware and on-premise software     license sales with its fast-growing cloud revenues.Grow revenue while navigating the shift to cloud-based     subscription sales, which forgo a large part of upfront revenue     typically generated by on-license software sales.Here is a breakout of Oracle's revenue growth for the first   six months of its fiscal 2017, which ends in May. As you can see   below, growth in cloud-based revenue (software, platform and   infrastructure as a service) is currently offsetting declines   elsewhere -- most notably in on-premise new software   licenses.SectorRevenue ChangeConstant-Currency GrowthShare of RevenueCloud SaaS and PaaS$74181%9%Cloud IaaS$219%2%On-premise new software licenses($452)(15%)13%On-premise software license updates and product           support$1913%55%Hardware products($183)(15%)6%Hardware support(57%)(4%)6%Service revenue($72)(3%)9%Total$1892%100%Data source: Oracle Corporation presentations. Table by   author. Data in millions of U.S. dollars.There are two reasons to be optimistic. First, analysts are   forecasting Oracle's revenue to grow 1.3% in 2017, with 3.3%   expected for 2018.Second, cloud-based subscription sales don't show the full   picture, because they produce an annual recurring revenue of   roughly a third of an up-font license sale. This is because   subscription revenue is recognized over time, while sitting on   the balance sheet as deferred revenue.This means that reported revenue is not entirely reflective of   underlying growth. Moreover, a look at short-term deferred   revenue -- up 8% in constant-currency terms in the second quarter   -- confirms Oracle's underlying business growth is good.Finally, a quick look at FCF/sales suggests Oracle is holding   up well during the transition, but declines in operating income   in the last two years have hit ROIC. No matter, if EPS bounces   back to 9% growth as expected in the year ending May 2018, the   stock will start to look very cheap.Data source: Oracle Corporation presentations. Chart by   author.Cisco analysisWhile Oracle seems to be on track, the cloud appears to be   creating more problems than opportunities for Cisco Systems.   Increasing usage of network virtualization could mean companies   run their network architecture in the cloud rather than in   Cisco's sophisticated switches. Unfortunately, these switches   tend to be expensive and good revenue generators for Cisco.Similarly, if Cisco's routers and switches (which generate   around 45% of its revenue) become commoditized, then less   expensive options from competitors like Huawei or ZTE could   threaten Cisco's market position. Indeed, a look at its quarterly   switching and routing revenues shows that combined switching and   routing revenue growth has been negative for the last four   quarters.NGN = next-generation network. Data source: Cisco Systems   presentations. Chart by author.Put simply, Cisco needs to stabilize its core switching and   routing revenue while using its FCF to invest and grow its   non-core operations. It's a different, and more difficult,   problem than that faced by Oracle, and for that reason Cisco   should trade at a discount to its tech peer.Will Oracle Corporation stock fly high in 2017? Image source:   Oracle Corporation website.Which is the better buy?Cisco is definitely a cash cow, but the risk to its core   products remains, and if its products become commoditized then   pricing, earnings, and cash flow could go into protracted   decline. Oracle, on the other hand, looks to be on track with its   transition toward the cloud, and for that reason looks like a   more attractive investment.10 stocks we like better than OracleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Bernstein: Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Stronger Than Ever;1/5/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe past three months have been a bit rough onCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO), with CSCO stock down about 4.4% during that timeframe. If you ask Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu, however, the fundamental case for Cisco stock is as strong as it has ever been.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSlapping a price target of $35 on CSCO stock, Bernstein sees room for a 16% improvement from where shares trade today. Specifically, the catalysts Ferragu's team notes include an improved macro-environment and easier compares.From Ferragu:""We continue to believe Cisco's fundamentals are stronger than ever. While usual bear arguments (white box, SDN, move to the cloud) continue to hurt sentiment and a difficult macro-environment hurts topline, the company is successfully moving towards a higher quality and more profitable subscription revenue model, underpinned by an increase of software and cloud-based services in its revenue mix.""Debunking the CSCO Stock Bear CasesNotably, Bernstein takes some Cisco bear cases to task, dubbing bearish takes on white box, software-defined networking and CSCO's cloud transition as ""fragile"" arguments.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New YearIf the white-box hype is ""bursting like an ill-craftedsoufflé au fromage,"" then it's just as well that Cisco and its network of vendors sling ""much more than just boxes.""""They offer end-to-end networking environment to their clients and only extreme players like Google and Amazon will find value in developing their own environment running on white-box hardware.""Software-defined networking, Bernstein notes, is ""daunting"" from a development standpoint. Rather than companies developing their own solutions or opting forArista Networks Inc's(NYSE:ANET) platform, the analysts believe Cisco will maintain its lead in this market.The move to the cloud, too, is ""objectively not a reality."" Rather, it's more of an expansion, to which Ferragu compares to the use of legacy mainframes in computing:""Remember mainframes, which were all what IT was in banking three decades ago. Over the last thirty years, banks have not developed a single new application on mainframes, but have maintained them for their core applications … and have kept spending on mainframes over that period.""Bottom Line on CSCO StockWith a dividend yield of 3.5% and 5% to 10% in earnings growth, Bernstein sees CSCO stock offering a return you can't refuse. The transition to a recurring revenue model only serves to bolster the case for Cisco stock, while the improvement of the macro picture in 2017 should bring the company back to year-over-year growth.3 Reasons Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) Stock Will Win In 2017The analysts expect CSCO to report earnings above consensus for the full fiscal year, while the improving macro picture in the second half of 2017 should push Cisco revenues 3% above consensus and per-share earnings 6% above estimates in 2018.You could do a lot worse.As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' Picks5 Stocks to Buy Ahead of the ""January Effect""The postBernstein: Cisco Systems, Inc.

Bull of the Day: ePlus (PLUS);1/5/2017;"ePlus(PLUS) is an $823 million technology integrator and solutions provider to corporate enterprise, healthcare, education, and public sector/government institutions across North America.makeZacksArticleAd();Big top and bottom line beats reported in early November for their fiscal 2017 second-quarter have estimates rising into next year and consequently the stock is back to a Zacks #1 Rank Strong Buy.With a record $1.268 billion in sales for the past 12 months ending in September -- giving it a very attractive Price-to-Sales ratio of 0.65 -- ePlus is focused primarily on specialized IT segments including data center infrastructure, networking, security, cloud and communications collaboration.The company's solutions incorporate hardware and software products from multiple leading IT vendors. And in December PLUS added a small vendor to its portfolio of services with the acquisition of Minnesota-based Consolidated Communications Holdings, half of whose 2015 revenue of $55 million was derived as aCisco(CSCO) gold partner.Q2's Big BeatsWhile the Wall Street consensus was looking for EPS of $2 on revenues of $339 million, ePlus delivered EPS of $2.47 on sales of $371.5 million. Here were the highlights from the company release...Net sales increased 10.5% to $371.5 million; technology segment net sales increased 11.3% to $362.7 million.Adjusted gross billings of product and services increased 13.0% to $487.3 million.Gross margin on sales of product and services expanded 80 basis points to 20.2%; consolidated gross margin increased 70 basis points to 22.1%.Net earnings increased 7.0% to $16.8 million.Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.4% to $29.9 million.Diluted earnings per share increased 12.6% to $2.42. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 12.8% to $2.47.The ePlus Hospital Without Walls SolutionNo better example of the innovative and critical solutions ePlus is trusted with can be found than in the healthcare sector with this week's news.On January 4, PLUS announced that it designed and deployed a full technology infrastructure upgrade for Garrett Regional Medical Center in Maryland. This was important to the hospital as they fulfill the unique function of being a ""border"" hospital the serves patients from West Virginia and even Pennsylvania too.The solution included:Desktop and server virtualizationStorage area networkWireless and telemedicine infrastructureDisaster recoveryGarrett Regional Medical Center is a 55-bed, not-for-profit, acute care facility with a long history of serving the health care needs of Garrett County, Maryland and the surrounding communities in West Virginia.The technology refresh for Garrett enables streamlined applications and clinician access, bedside medication verification, improved user experience, enhanced collaboration on patient cases, and continuity of care.Valuation and TargetsPLUS shares have had quite a run since that earnings report, up over 30% from $90 to nearly $120. This has stretched the valuation somewhat. For example, Stifel Nicolaus analysts raised their 12-month price target on shares in early December to $113 based on 14X their fiscal year 2018 (starts in April) EPS of $8.06.The Stifel analysts noted then that consolidation among major IT vendors like Dell buying EMC is a positive for ePlus as mergers typically lead to staff reduction and the need for resellers to help support smaller customers.Back in November, another prominent Wall Street investment bank noted that at $90 the stock was trading at 12.5 times their calendar 2017 EPS estimate of $7.20, compared to the peer group at a blended group median multiple of 11.8 times.It seems that given its growth in cloud services and security, and its pedigree of partners that reads like a who's who of the top technology companies, PLUS is afforded a higher multiple for a small cap stock with a 25-year history. I don't know when it makes new highs above $120, but I would have it on my radar on dips to $110.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?

Reasons to Bet on Cisco's Strong Dividend, Value in 2017;1/5/2017;"Investors who are looking for a strong tech dividend payer in 2017 should have Cisco Systems (CSCO) on their radar. Cisco shares began trading ex-dividend Wednesday.True, it's no longer the 1990's and the San Francisco-based networking giant isn't dominating the tech world. But Cisco's dividend yield of 3.44%, which beats the 2.00% yield of the S&P 500 Index, ranks Cisco as one of the more generous payers in tech. And with Cisco stock falling some 4.5% over the past three months, now's the time to own an undervalued tech leader that is poised to outperform the market in the next 12 to 18 months.Analysts at Argus recently bumped their price target on Cisco shares from $34 to $37.The stock closed Tuesday at $30.28, which translates to a potential stock premium of 23%. ""We believe that these risks are offset by the company's extensive relationships with communications equipment buyers, as well as by its technology leadership, aggressive but prudent business development program, and strong balance sheet,"" analyst Jim Kelleher wrote in a note.makeArticleAd();Cisco didn't have an exceptional year last year as fiscal 2016 revenue grew just 0.2%. But the company in November, reported fiscal 2017 first-quarter earnings results that beat Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. First quarter earnings per share of 61 cents topped forecasts by 2 cents, while revenue of $12.35 billion beat by some $20 million. Investors were concerned by the company's guidance, which calls for revenue to decline almost 2%.The company forecast second-quarter earnings to be in a range from 55 cents to 57 cents per share, lower than Street estimate of 59 cents. Meanwhile, revenue is expected to be between $11.27 billion to $11.51 billion, lower than the $12.15 billion estimate analysts expected. However, in 2018 and beyond, the company is expected to rebound from new products, which could jump-start growth.The company has begun to focus on fast-growing revenue streams such as Internet of Things (IoT), collaboration, next generation data, the cloud and security. And this makes Cisco stock an ideal candidate for a rebound. The stock is priced at just 12 times forward earnings, which is some six points below the S&P 500 Index.Assuming the stock was priced on par with the rest of the market the stock would trade today at around $40, or 32% above current levels. Combined with Cisco's strong dividend yield of 3.44%, there is tons of reasons to be bullish on Cisco for the next 12 to 18 months."

5 Stocks to Buy for a Big January;1/4/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough the month of January is generally a good one for the market (with theS&P 500averaging a 0.8% gain), the first month of the calendar year is an unusually good month for certain stocks to buy, year in and year out.Source: ShutterstockThe reason? Well. the most plausible reason is that it's got something to do with the foray into a new tax year, or perhaps cold weather ultimately spurs a bullish sentiment on these names.makeArticleAd();Regardless of the reason, it happens. With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at the top five stocks to buy this month.The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     YearI've calculated the lifetime monthly returns for each stock using a proprietary charting platform, and each of them is in the habit of reliably making their way decidedly higher during January.Stocks to Buy in January: Apple (AAPL)Click to EnlargeAverage January Gain:2.9%There's never really a bad time to ownApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but the beginning of the year is historically a great time to move AAPL from your list of potential stocks to buy into your portfolio.The company needs no introduction or explanation - it's the maker of the iPhone. Enough said. What's worth pointing out, though, is the fact that nearly all of its iPhone launches (and all of the recent ones) have occurred in September, further solidifying the stock's calendar-based tendencies; traders tend to dish out a fairly limited number of predictable responses.The proof is in the numbers. Apple stock advances an average of 2.9% during January, and makes a gain of some size 63% of the time.Stocks to Buy in January: Microsoft (MSFT)Click to EnlargeAverage January Gain:4.8%WhileMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) may not have the same rabid fan base AAPL stock does, it makes more - and more consistent - progress than Apple shares do, surprisingly enough. And January is an especially great month for MSFT shares.They average a gain of 4.8%, and end the month higher than where that started it 66% of the time, easily earning it a spot on the roster of stocks to buy sooner than later.And January of 2017 could be a particularly good year for Microsoft shareholders, as 2016's full-year performance was sub-par.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksThe stock's got some catching up to do;the fundamental underpinnings are more than compelling enough.Stocks to Buy in January: Level 3 Communications (LVLT)Click to EnlargeAverage January Gain:10.2%Just for the record,Level 3 Communications, Inc.(NYSE:LVLT) usually ends up giving most of its big January gains back in November. Doesn't matter.The January gain is usually more than worth the quick in-and-out. LVLT has averaged a gain of 10.2% for the month going back many years, and makes a gain in January 78% of the time.Level 3 shares are particularly attractive this month, as their lackluster performance in 2016 has left room for some upside this year.Stocks to Buy in January: Cisco (CSCO)Click to EnlargeAverage January Gain:4%Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) has earned a spot on too many lists of stocks to buy lately, short-term or long-term.Its bread-and-butter router/switching hardware business is under attack by software-based alternatives, and though Cisco has undertaken some R&D of its own to remain competitive, it's in the midst of a war it was never planning on fighting.There is an upside to this paradigm shift, however. The era of software-based virtual switches and routers translates intohigh-margin, recurring revenue. The top line isn't quite as strong as it would be with hardware, but the bottom line is still attractive.With that as the backdrop, yes, CSCO stock may be worth a shot here … especially as we move into the heart of January.5 Stocks to Buy Ahead of the ""January     Effect""The stock averages a gain of 4% for the month and ends January higher almost two-thirds of the time.Stocks to Buy in January: Hologic (HOLX)Click to EnlargeAverage January Gain:9.2%Last but not least, putHologic, Inc.(NASDAQ:HOLX) on your list of stocks to buy at least for the month currently underway.With just a quick glance, Hologic's trailing price-earnings ratio of 89 makes the stock tough to get excited about owning … even for the short run. The past doesn't look anything like the future, though.The company announced last month itwould be selling its blood-screening division, and just this weekthe FDA approved Hologic's Aptima HIV-1 Quant Assay, which should prove to be a superior HIV diagnostic tool.Point being, it's a whole new ballgame for 2017. The pros think the current year is going to be considerably more profitable, too.HOLX gains an average of 9.2% in January, and makes its way higher for the month 69% of the time.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.The post5 Stocks to Buy for a Big Januaryappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Better Buy: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co vs. Cisco Systems, Inc;1/4/2017;"Some of the biggest players in the ever-changing tech industry   have been forced to reinvent themselves, or risk becoming   obsolete. For networking kingCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , change has meant a shift away from legacy,   enterprise hardware to a focus on cloud infrastructure, data   security, the Internet of Things (IoT), and communication   solutions.If anything,HP Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) is undergoing even more changes than its cloud   infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) brethren. Based on its more   than 50% jump in value last year, most investors and pundits are   on board with the ""new"" HP Enterprise. So, which is the better   buy, HP Enterprise or Cisco?makeArticleAd();Image source:Cisco.The case for CiscoIf there were any questions as to Cisco's commitment to   transitioning to fast-growing new markets, those were laid to   rest when it announced in August it would eliminate 5,500   jobs -- equal to about 7% of its global workforce -- to focus on   its ""key priority areas."" Namely, the aforementioned cloud data   centers, IoT, security, and collaboration offerings.Cisco is already making strides where it counts. Excluding its   now divested SP Video business, Cisco's revenue climbed 1% to   $12.35 billion compared to a year ago. After removing one-time   items, per-share earnings improved 3% to $0.61. That may not   appear overly impressive, but Cisco was able to grow sales and   its bottom line despite a 7% decline in its old-school   switching business.Though switching sales remain the top revenue driver, Cisco   was able to make up for the unit's decline thanks to its strong   6% jump in routing revenue to $2.1 billion, due in large part to   cloud-related offerings, and a whopping 11% year-over-year   improvement in data security sales. Better still, particularly in   the long run, Cisco's focus on building a recurring revenue model   is hitting on all cylinders.Last quarter, subscription and software sales growth helped   boost service revenue 7.5% to $3 billion. Service-related   deferred revenue -- another measure of Cisco's recurring   sales model -- grew to $10.4 billion, up 7.6% from a year ago.   Not only do recurring sales provide a stable revenue source, it   costs less to generate than new sales. Cisco's drop in expenses   last quarter despite growing total revenue is a testament to   that.Image source:HP Enterprise.The case for HP EnterpriseChanges are most certainly afoot with HP Enterprise. Not the   least of which is its pending spinoff mergers. In keeping with   CEO Meg Whitman's strategy of better positioning HP Enterprise to   quickly adapt to new opportunities, it is merging its   Enterprise Services unit withComputer Sciences Corp(NYSE: CSC) , creating a ""$26 billion pure play IT services   company.""The CSC news was followed by a similar move to spin off   HP Enterprise's ""non-core software assets"" and merge them with   U.K.-basedMicro Focus(NASDAQOTH: MCFUF) . Both deals are expected to close at the end   of March.The result of the spinoffs, in addition to HP Enterprise   becoming more nimble, includes ownership stakes of approximately   50% in each of the ""new"" companies for shareholders -- not to   mention a tidy $2.5 billion cash payment to HP Enterprise,   strengthening its already impressive balance sheet.Last quarter, HP Enterprise's cash and equivalents   climbed over $3 billion compared to a year ago, to nearly $13   billion. Not only does its rock-solid balance sheet demonstrate   HP Enterprise's financial stability, it also positions it to   target niche acquisitions to fill any gaps in its suite of   solutions. The recent $275 million deal for big data analytics   and high-performance computing provider SGI is a recent   example.Which is the better buy?Even after its banner 2016, HP Enterprise stock is   trading at a mere 11 times future earnings, making it one of   the best values in its sector. Cisco is trading at just 12   times forward earnings, and with its nearly 3.5% dividend yield   and future prospects, it's the better buy for growth and income   investors.That said, when the smoke clears, HP Enterprise will be   ideally positioned to grow by leaps and bounds as 2017 progresses   -- and beyond. For investors in search of pure growth potential,   HP Enterprise gets the nod.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

What Does 2017 Hold for the Internet of Things?;1/3/2017;"The Internet of Things (IoT), which links mobile devices,   wearables, home automation devices, cars, and other gadgets to   each other and the cloud, is frequently considered the next big   growth market for hardware and software makers.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) estimates that the number of connected devices   worldwide will double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion by   2020.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();That's why chipmakers likeIntelandQualcommlaunched new low-power chips for IoT devices, and networking   leaders like Cisco andJuniper Networksadded IoT features to their networking hardware and software.   Looking ahead into 2017, the battle over the IoT market will   likely heat up as these companies expand their hardware and   software ecosystems. Let's take a look at the four main trends   investors should pay close attention to.Security concernsThe Mirai botnet and its variantsrecently hijackedunsecured IoT devices -- like IP cameras and routers -- to take   down major websites with DDoS (distributed denial of service)   attacks. Those attacks revealed that many IoT devices were   poorly protected from a type of threat that was previously   rendered obsolete on PC and mobile platforms.If additional attacks occur in 2017, many organizations and   consumers could reconsider connecting everything to the Internet   of Things. However, Cisco,Symantec(NASDAQ: SYMC) , and other security giants are already developing   new tools forsecuring IoT devices.Cisco's acquisition of IoT platform provider Jasper will help   its cybersecurity tools reach more connected devices, and   Symantec helps  IoT device makers build more secure   products. These efforts could eventually make IoT devices as   secure as PCs or mobile devices.Privacy concernsAnother key concern about the IoT market is privacy. Back in   2015, several German automakers expressed concerns about lettingAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google track their drivers'   activities in connected cars. That's why Audi,BMW, andDaimlerteamed up to buyNokia's HERE Maps as aGoogle Maps alternativelater that year.A recent murder case for which anAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo might provide evidence also highlights the   consequences of installing ""always on"" IoT devices in homes.   Police and  prosecutors believe that audio files from the   device could help them crack the case, but Amazon has refused to   turn over the files due to privacy concerns.Amazon Echo. Image source: Amazon.Privacy advocates believe that the case would set a precedent   for letting law enforcement agencies access smart home devices.   That would pose a problem for companies like Amazon, Google, andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) , which thrive on ""learning"" more about their users   to produce targeted shopping and advertising experiences.The brewing IoT bubbleBullish forecasts about the IoT market have fueled a land grab   across the market. That stampede yielded some innovative products   like Amazon's Echo and Google Home, but the market is also filled   with oddball devices like smart water bottles, fitness trackers   for dogs, connected umbrellas, and smart tampons.The proliferation of frivolous devices suggests that a big   bubble in the IoT market is brewing, similar to the dot-com   bubble of the late 1990s in which websites were launched for all   sorts of impractical purposes. And just like the dot-com bust of   2000, an IoT bust could purge the market of the weaker players   and create a more refined field for leaders like Amazon and   Google to expand their IoT ecosystems.The upcoming ecosystem warBut as Amazon, Google, and other companies gradually advance   into our homes, their ecosystems will start overlapping. Amazon   will leverage its market-leading position in e-commerce and   prisoner-taking Prime ecosystem to push devices like the Echo,   Dash buttons, Kindle Fire, and Fire TV into homes to widen its   moat against potential challengers.Google will leverage its knowledge of your search, web   browsing, location, and ad-clicking histories to personalize its   smart home devices like Home. Its connections to Android, the   most popular mobile OS in the world, make its smart home platform   a practical extension of mobile devices for many users.But that's not all:Appleis trying to tether IoT devices to its HomeKit platform, and   Facebook plans to launch its Jarvis home AI in the near future.   This means that the same battle that was previously waged across   websites, mobile apps, and hardware will rage on in your living   rooms next year.The key takeawaysThe Internet of Things is a fascinating new market, but   investors should take companies' lofty IoT promises with a grain   of salt. Security and privacy concerns will still loom large next   year, while hardware and software companies will clash over   competing ecosystems.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should You Buy Target Corporation (TGT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;1/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith 2016 having just ended,Target Corporation(NYSE:TGT) investors were dealt another year of TGT stock underperforming theS&P 500and some of its peers; it's something that's become a bit too familiar for Target shareholders in recent years.Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Like all companies, it has got its good points and bad points; any decision to buy Target stock, or any stock for that matter, should take into consideration everything positive and negative about it, leaving the ultimate decision without doubt.makeArticleAd();Certainly, a man being fatallystabbedon Christmas Eve in a Target store in Northern California isn't a positive. Nor is its mishandling of the company's policy change regarding itstransgendercustomers' use of its bathrooms and fitting rooms.While these aren't game breakers by any means, you can't help but wonder if Target is permanently off its game.Heading into 2017, investors are going to be looking at what kind of Christmas the discount retailer had and whether there's any point in continuing to give TGT stock the benefit of the doubt.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Here are three pros and cons central to whether you should buy Target stock.Target Stock ProsReversion to the Mean:Target stock has beenbeatenby the S&P 500 in four out of the last six years and by its discount store peers in three of the last six - not exactly the kind of performance investors are looking for.However, if you believe, as I do, that stocks tend to return to their historical averages after a period of underperformance or over performance, than TGT stock is ready for a bounce.In 2015, Target underperformed the index by 289 basis points; in 2016, that spread will jump to almost 900 basis points, a much worse result than the year before.Looking at Target's financials, one shouldn't be nearly as pessimistic about its chances.Bottom Line:While the top line faced some issues in 2016, the bottom line fared much better. In the first nine months of the year ended October 29, Target's EBITDA increased by 1.6% year-over-year to$5.3 billionand generating an EBITDA margin of 10.9%, 90 basis points higher than in the same period a year earlier.Especially positive was its third-quarter report which saw EBITDA profits increase by a robust 6.8% to $1.6 billion generating an EBITDA margin of 9.9%, 130 basis points higher than in the same quarter a year earlier.Even CEO Brian Cornell was surprised.""We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflect meaningful improvement in our traffic and sales trends and much stronger-than-expected profitability,""saidCornell. ""Favorable gross margin mix and efficient execution by our team drove third quarter EPS performance well beyond our guidance.""It might be facing some top-line comp struggles but it can still deliver the goods when it comes to profitability and if I can only have strong top-line or strong bottom-line growth, I'll take profits over sales any day of the week.Digital:Its online sales grew by 26% in the third quarter contributing 0.7% comparable sales growth against a 1% decline in comparable sales at its physical locations. Without the online business growing, Target's Q3 2016 sales would have looked even more anemic than they actually were.Looking on the bright side, its digital channel grew by 60 basis points in the first nine months of 2016 and now represents 3.5% of Target's overall revenue.InvestorPlace contributor Chris Fraley made a good pointrecentlythat Target shoppers are younger than the typicalWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT) shopper which suggests that when it comes to growing its online business, Target's got a much greater upside than WMT does.More importantly, Target customers are wealthier than WMT customers, which means they'll be more inclined to shop online and pay for the last minute shipping costs.Target Stock ConsDigital:Say what? Didn't I just say that its online business was a positive for the company? I did indeed. But, business isn't always black or white. More often it's gray. Target should be ashamed of itself for generating only 3.5% of its business from its digital business.Sure, $2.6 billion sounds big until you realize that Target generates more than $73 billion a year in annual revenues. I've said it before and I'll say it again. If you're a big-time retailer, online revenue has to represent at least10%of overall sales on annual basis.Holiday Revenue:According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, 10 U.S. retailers were expected to generate66%of this year's holiday revenues. Target's on the list, which is good news, but it's only expected to account for 3.7% of the retail revenue generated by all of the retail constituents that make up the S&P 1500.Meanwhile, WMT, its biggest rival other thanAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), is expected to grab 23% of the holiday revenue generated by retailers in the broader index.That's a good news, bad news type of situation for Target.The good news is that it spreads Target revenue across 12 months of the year making it less vulnerable to economic downturns where customers cut back on Christmas spending.The bad news is that Christmas, as Black Friday's history suggests, can be the difference between a good year and a great year. On that note, WMT is much more likely to please its shareholders at this time of year.Groceries:I'm a big fan of Phil Lempert whose weeklyfood reviewsat Supermarketguru.com I watch them religiously. Recently, he was asked about the negatives associated with Target's move to capture some grocery business from WMT and others.""[Target grocery sections were placed] not in the front of the store, but off to the side, or in the back,"" LemperttoldFox News. ""It's still going to have food over here, and tires over there. And for some people that's great.""I totally can relate to that.Before Target pulled out of Canada, its grocery section was at the back of the store's second floor, far removed from anything. Target failed in Canada for a lot of reasons and that was certainly one of them.Canadians aren't particularly fond of having to hunt for their food unless actual hunting is involved.Lempert suggests that the grocery sections are getting better placements these days but the damage may already have been done.Bottom Line on Target StockTarget stock is cheaper than all of its discount peers, grocery stores, and even most department stores with the exception ofDillard's, Inc.(NYSE:DDS) whose P/E ratio is a very-low 11.1 times earnings.Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Won't Be     Growing Anytime SoonIt currently yields 3.3% which is better than most of its peers. If you currently own TGT stock, I'd be inclined to own it as long as the yield remains above 3%.With a decent balance sheet and a good nose for profits, Target won't be the worst stock to own in 2017. In fact, I think if the markets overall don't go in the tank, Target stock could hit $90 in the next year, a level it hasn't seen since … ever.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50%     Upside in 20175 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 2017The postShould You Buy Target Corporation (TGT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Consappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Will Turnaround Efforts Help FireEye to Recover in 2017?;12/30/2016;"Once investors' darling in the cyber security space, things have not been in favor ofFireEye Inc.FEYEfor a while now. The stock is likely to close in the red once again this year, continuing its downfall for the third consecutive year.Historical PricesOn the very first day of its trade on the Nasdaq (Sep 20, 2013), the stock closed at $36, which was 80% higher than the Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of $20. The company ended the year 2013 on a strong note with its share prices increasing to $43.61.FireEye's shares shot up to as high as $86 in Feb 2014 on rumors of its merger with privately-held security software firm, Mandiant. However, shares fell drastically as the deal didn't materialize and never went even close to the Dec 31, 2013 closing price. In 2014, the stock lost almost 28%.The downfall continued in 2015 too with shares of FireEye declining 34%. Notably, at yesterday's closing price of $11.82, the stock has lost 67% from its first day trade and 41% from its IPO price.So far this year, FireEye has lost 43% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Softwareindustry's average negative return of just 6.3%.What Went Wrong with FireEye?Over the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players in the cyber security space which includes CiscoCSCO, Check Point SoftwareCHKPand Palo Alto NetworksPANW. These players have deals with large numbers of security vendors and have broader product portfolio, giving them a competitive advantage over FireEye.Furthermore, the company's top-line growth has also been affected due to its futuristic approach toward transitioning itself to the cloud and shifting its business model from hardware centric to subscription-based services. It should be noted that the company generates higher initial sales from hardware than the subscriptions.Due to the aforementioned factors, the company's top-line growth rates have been slowing down as evident from its last quarterly results. During third-quarter 2016, FireEye's year- over-year revenue growth rate slowed down to a meager 12.6% from 45.6% and 165.1% registered in third-quarter 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, the company's revenue growth guidance of just 1% to 4% for fourth-quarter 2016 reflects its limited growth prospects.Furthermore, the company's bottom-line results failed to please as well. Since Sep 2013 when it was debuted on the stock markets, the company has not been able to report profits in even a single quarter. In fact, FireEye's GAAP loss has widened on a year-over-year basis.Going ahead, negative operating cash flow remains a major headwind for FireEye, which may hinder the execution of its growth plans. In the first three quarters of 2016, the company generated negative operating cash flow of $21.5 billion. Considering the projections given by FireEye for the fourth quarter, the company is expected to end 2016 with a negative operating cash flow between $41 million and $51 million.Turnaround EffortsTo counter the aforementioned challenges, FireEye has taken a number of initiatives. Early this year, it acquired iSIGHT Partners to strengthen its current product lineup and offer an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers will find difficult to match.FireEye has also taken over Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times post a cyber-attack. Its product, Security Orchestrator, is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs.The company has launched FireEye Essentials, a lower-cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform. It is targeting smaller, mid-market companies with the new offering.Furthermore, last month it has launched new Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings, a lower cost intelligent threat detection solution for large enterprises as well as mid-market businesses.Also, FireEye is focusing on cost cutting initiatives, which include the layoff of 300 to 400 workers to boost its bottom-line performance. Through these initiatives, it intends to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $80 million.Though shifting its business model to subscription-based services will generate lower revenues initially but the same will be stable in the long-run as organizations usually renew their subscriptions with the existing products or even with higher versions. Moreover, subscription-based services generate higher gross margins.All these indicate FireEye's efforts to move beyond the enterprise level and end-point protection products it had started off with. These factors are also likely to aid the company's long-term results.Bottom LineWe believe that the company's turnaround efforts will yield results in the long run. Given the positive earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), we are optimistic about FireEye's recovery in 2017.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Juniper's Year In Review: Product Revenues Stagnate, Profits Impacted;12/29/2016;"IT hardware vendors have observed a slowdown in product sales over the last couple of years, with networking giant Juniper (JNPR) witnessing a similar trend across its product lines. Juniper has reported strong revenue growth for its network switches over the years while core routing revenues have stagnated in the same period. On the other hand, Juniper has struggled in the network security domain with a double digit revenue decline over the last few years. As a result, combined product sales have been roughly flat over the last few years. The trend has continued in 2016 thus far with theservices division driving much of the top line growthfor the company. Moreover, the services segment has become more profitable for the company while falling hardware prices have compressed the product segment's margins. Below we take a look at how Juniper Networks has performed this year.Unimpressive Numbers For Network Security,   RoutingmakeArticleAd();Juniper's core routing revenues have witnessed limited growth over the last few years with a CAGR of 1% from 2011 through 2015. This trend continued in 2016 with revenues falling by 1% through the first three quarters of the year to $1.7 billion. More worrying for the company has been its network security segment, which has posted an 11% annual decline in revenues over the last few years. Network security revenues through the first three quarters of the year were down by 26% to under $240 million. In the same period, competing networking company Cisco (CSCO) reported 4% y-o-y growth in network security revenues to $1.6 billion. (Read:Cisco's 2016 In Review: Higher Profits Despite Revenue Slowdown)On the other hand, Juniper's switching segment has performed well this year with revenues rising by 9% y-o-y to $607 million through the first thee quarters of the year. The company has witnessed strong demand for its new QFX product line from various cloud providers, telecom customers, cable providers and Federal government agencies. In the most recent quarter, the company reported a 50% annual increase in revenues generated by sales of the QFX switch product line.Low product sales have led to discounted selling prices, which ultimately drove down product margins over the last few years. The adjusted gross margin for the product divisions combined has fallen from under 67.6% in 2011 to around 65.3% in 2015. This has further compressed to 62.4% this year. On the other hand, the company's services gross margin has improved by almost 2 percentage points to 62.1% through the first three quarters of the year due to a higher rate of maintenance contract renewals and a higher proportion of services-based networking solutions on offer. Management targets a long-term gross margin of around 64% in the coming quarters, which can be achieved by higher sales volumes and a high attach rate of customers in the services segment.Despite an improvement in services gross margin, the company-wide gross margin was down by almost a percentage point to 62.3% through the first three quarters of the year. Additionally, Juniper's operating expenses in the same period increased by around 3% to $1.64 billion as shown below. Resulting earnings per share were down by around 5% over the comparable prior year period to $1.04.Juniper's management expects the trend from the first three quarters of the year to continue through the December quarter as well. Net revenues could grow at a steady 2% to $1.35 billion, with the most revenue growth coming from switching product sales and the services division. Gross margin could compress by around 80 basis points to around 63% as shown below. In an attempt to improve profitability and earnings per share, management mentioned that the company aims to improve its cost structure in coming quarters. For December quarter, operating expenses are expected to fall by 9% y-o-y to around $510 million. If the company can successfully reduce operating expenses in the fourth quarter, Juniper's full year EPS could be around 3% higher than 2015 levels at $1.66 per share.We have a$25 price estimate for Juniper, which is around 10% lower than the current market price. Juniper's stock price has fluctuated between $22 and $32 this year.

Should I Buy Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;12/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Corp(ADR)(NYSE:NOK) stock has gained a little over 10% in the last two months after experiencing a bit of a rally. However, looking at the picture for the entire year, Nokia stock is still off 31% year-to-date. The fact is that despite the recent comeback, NOK stock still faces several tough fundamental challenges.Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Consider that NOK's outlook for next year calls for a 2% decline in the networking business. It's important to note that telecom carriers have been holding off on purchases because they have already spent substantial amounts on upgrading their networks to 4G technologies.makeArticleAd();There is also weakness in emerging markets. In fact, with the surge of the dollar, the problems may get even worse. All of this is kind of grim, right? But when it comes to investing, a contrarian approach can certainly lead to nice profits.So does Nokia stock fit the bill? Perhaps the company is poised for a turnaround? Well, let's take a look.Three Pros to Owning Nokia StockInnovation: Nokia Technologies is the segment that focuses on consumer and professional technology offerings, such as those for digital health and media. Although, for the most part, much of the growth has been from licensing its extensive patent portfolio.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017But NOK is certainly investing aggressively with its own innovations. For example, the company has developed a sophisticated virtual reality system for professionals. One of the marquee clients isSony Corp(ADR)(NYSE:SNE), which has had lots of success with its PlayStation VR platform.In addition to this, Nokia is making another play for the smartphone market. The device is called theNokia P, which is based onAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system and will be manufactured byHon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd.(OTCMKTS:HNHPF). Granted, the smartphone market is brutally competitive. But it is encouraging that NOK is taking some risks. Besides, the company has a lot of experience marketing technologies in developing countries.Nokia stock has also been getting more adventuresome with mergers and acquisitions. Just look at the deal for Withings. The company is a pioneer in the connected health market, such as with digital weighting scales, activity trackers and baby monitors. According to NOK's own research, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of37% from 2015 to 2020.Network: NOK has a high-performance, end-to-end platform, covering mobile networks, fixed networks, IP/optical networks, applications and analytics. Because of this, the company has been able to sell to a wide assortment of customers, such as in verticals like energy, the public sector and transportation. What's more, the recent acquisition of Gainspeed has been important in attracting cable operator customers too.But the real play is for 5G mobile networks. According to areportfromTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(NASDAQ:ERIC), the market is expected to hit 550 million users by 2022. A key driver will be the megatrend of the Internet of Things, which involves wireless connections among devices, as well as video and VR.According toInvestorPlace.com's Dana Blankenhorn: ""If you get into Nokia now, you're catching the next wave of network spending at its bottom, and can ride that wave to profit. That is the bull case, and while that might take some time to prove out, it's a good bet carriers will spend again in the next three to five years.""Dividend and Fiscal Disciplne: With the transformative acquisition of Alcaltel Lucent, NOK is expected to generate savings of €1.2 billion per year. And these may ultimately prove to be fairly conservative. If anything, NOK has shown a great ability to be disciplined with its cost structure.In other words, margins are likely to expand over time, especially as the network business starts to recover.In the meantime, investors will likely enjoy a competitive dividend, which is at nearly 6%.Three Cons to Owning Nokia StockHistory and Brand: NOK has a storied history. Back in the late 1980s, the company realized the potential of the mobile industry and started to develop its own devices. Nokia was also critical in establishing the core standards for wireless systems. So by the end of the 1990s, the company was one of the most valuable tech operators in the world.But unfortunately, NOK failed to keep up the innovation, which allowedApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and GOOGL to dominate the market. By 2012, Nokia stock sunk below $2 a share and it looked like survival was in doubt.So yes, it is remarkable that the company has been able to get some stability and invest in growth. But then again, when it comes to turnarounds in the tech industry, the success rate is usually not so good. It is incredibly tough to catch up - and there is always the tarnishing of the brand. After all, how many people want to buy a product from a company that seems like a has-been?Competition: Even with the consolidation, the networking business remains highly competitive. Granted, some of the rivals are not particularly strong, such as Ericsson. But these kinds of companies can still be very problematic since they are often tempted to engage in price wars.Although, for NOK stock the biggest threat could be from the operators in China, like Huawei and ZTE. They not only have the benefit of low-cost platforms but also preferential access to their home markets.Moreover, growth has been strong. For the first half of this year, the revenues of Huawei spiked by40% to $36.8 billion. Then again, the company has a diversified revenue base, which not only includes the sales of networking equipment but also smartphones (ranked No. 3 in the world).Currently, NOK has the second highest market share for wireless infrastructure equipment, at about 26%. This compares to Huawei's 23%. However, given the company's growth ramp, it probably won't be long until it becomes the world leader.Should You Buy Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)     Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsPatents: Licensing of intellectual property has been the only growth driver for Nokia stock. In thelatest quarter, this business helped ignite a 109% increase in sales for the Nokia Technologies division. The run-rate for the year is expected to hit €950 million.But there is a big issue: About€150 millionof existing licensing revenues will expire this year. This is one of the reasons NOK has beenramping up its legal efforts.Yet this type of litigation can be time consuming and unpredictable. And even if there is a win, it can still take years of appeals to get any resolution. More importantly, AAPL is known to be a tough fighter when it comes to IP claims.Bottom Line On Nokia StockWhile the long-term prospects of 5G look promising, it will take time for the market to get going. Customers will certainly try to find ways to delay the heavy investments and try to find ways to keep leveraging the existing networks. There are also the intense competitive forces that will weigh on margins.In the meantime, NOK stock must deal with other problems, such as the expiration of a bulk of the licensing business. If the company is unable to manage this, the revenue impact will definitely be significant.So given all this, the cons outweigh the pros - even though Nokia stock does sport a compelling dividend yield.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you   canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Should You Buy Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;12/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been an exciting year forCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) shareholders. The company started to change course following longtime CEO John Chamber's exit last year. Chuck Robbins took the reins last July, and has refocused the company's strategy toward the cloud. Robbins has acquired many businesses in that space. 2016 delivered better results for CSCO stock, and 2017 is shaping up nicely, as analysts forecast renewed strength in networking.Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Add it all up, and Cisco stock finally got some traction. After trading essentially flat for the past decade, CSCO stock is up 12% in 2016. Can the good times continue heading into next year?makeArticleAd();CSCO Stock ConsTransitional Challenges: Cisco, like many older tech companies, relies on legacy technologies. Older inventions still drive much of CSCO's profits and cash flow. Consider switching, for example. This segment accounts for almost a third of Cisco's sales, yet it is declining at a high single-digit rate. Thus, it needs to find a lot of growth in other areas to make up for the steady erosion of its top offering. Bulls can counter this point by showing other segments, such as security, that rose at a double-digit rate. But these gains come from a small starting base, and are often in areas with more aggressive competition.Cisco is indeed making the right moves with big pushes in cloud, security and services. However, at least for the next couple of years, these appear merely sufficient to offset declines elsewhere, rather than powering the company as a whole to meaningful growth. There are worse positions in the world than sitting on $70 billion in cash while milking cash cow legacy businesses. However, for strong CSCO stock performance in the future, these newer initiatives need to replace the current fading divisions.Eroding Position Competitively: While Cisco's longer-term results still seem fairly strong, there are worrying signs. Gross margins, for one. Cisco generated gross margins in excess of 70% in 2003, and traditionally earned high 60s margins last decade. These slipped to the high 50s recently, before rebounding modestly in 2016. Falling margins indicate a slipping competitive position. Other companies are hitting Cisco on pricing and taking away the company's profitability.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017The company's return on assets has also dropped sharply. It traditionally ran around 14% to 15% prior to the Great Financial Crisis. In recent years, this has fallen into the single digits, and sits at about 9% currently. This reflects the company's inability to convert profits into new opportunities. Whether this is because the company has cash tied up overseas or simply due to a lack of investment opportunities, it leads to poor returns on CSCO stock. A company that can't find attractive uses for its cash will struggle to deliver strong returns.China Risk: Cisco generates almost half of its revenues outside of the U.S. Given President-elect Trump's threats to target China specifically and trade in general, Cisco is more vulnerable than many to a trade war.Many of the products that Cisco makes can be copied by cheaper Asian competition. Companies such asHuaweiwould love to take more market share away from Cisco. And in a scenario where various countries start throwing retaliatory tariffs back at the U.S., it would put Cisco in an unfavorable position. Combine that with the worsening overvalued U.S. dollar issue, and Cisco may have issues internationally.CSCO Stock ProsCash Coming Home: Cisco currently operates with a gigantic cash pile. The company counts more than $70 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities. The vast majority of this is held off-shore to avoid taxation on profits. Should Trump get his way, it appears that there would be a tax break, allowing companies such as Cisco to bring their money back to the U.S.Given that Cisco's whole market cap is just $150 billion, it's clear that having more than $60 billion in newly available cash could unlock real value in CSCO stock. Whether the company uses it to boost the already solid dividend, buy back stock or make acquisitions, any such avenue is likely to produce better results than the current situation.Relatively Cheap: Cisco stock currently trades around 15x earnings and 13x forward earnings. That compares quite favorably to the tech industry as a whole. Although if you view CSCO as a so-called tech utility - with much less growth - the valuation is about what you'd expect.That said, Cisco stock has proven itself capable of continuing to grow at a modest clip. The company has grown revenues at a compounded 7.5% rate over the past 10 years. And free cash flow has advanced 6.6% annually over that same span. Given the general overvaluation in the U.S. stock market, a company trading at 15x earnings with 6% to 7% growth rates over the longer haul isn't a bad idea.Big Dividend: The 3.4% dividend makes CSCO stock the single highest yielding mega-cap tech company in the U.S: 3.4% places it just ahead ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) at 3.36%. Cisco has grown the dividend at a 22% annualized rate over the past five years, and raised it 20% this past year.Should I Buy International Business Machines     Corp. (IBM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsOf course, a good chunk of that came from the rising dividend payout ratio. The company has elected to return more cash to shareholders. That said, over the last couple of years, the dividend payout ratio has stabilized, while the dividend continues to rise. Should the cash repatriation plans come into effect, CSCO should have plenty of runway to keep raising the dividend at a strong clip for years to come.Bottom Line on Cisco StockCSCO stock is one of the U.S.' cheapest large tech companies. And it has some growing divisions to pick up the slack for its fading legacy operations. The dividend is large, growing and defended with a strong balance sheet. However, should Cisco's acquisitions and growth strategy fail to play out, the stock could end up dead money, offering little more than the dividend.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned CSCO stock and   IBM stock.

FireEye Inc's Best Moves in 2016;12/28/2016;"I've generallybeen bearishonFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) , the once-promising cybersecurity firm that lost   over 40% of its value in 2016. The company's declining revenue   growth, widening GAAP losses, unstable cash flow, and executive   exodus all indicate that the stock could fall further next year.   However, those challenges shouldn't completely overshadow its   accomplishments this year. Let's take a look back at three of   FireEye's smartest moves in 2016.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();1. Appointing Kevin Mandia as its new CEOFireEye's future looked bleak after CEO David DeWalt abruptly   announced his  resignation earlier this year. After all,   DeWalt had led FireEye for over four years, and helped establish   its ""best-in-breed"" reputation in threat detection solutions.   DeWalt was also willing to sell FireEye, which would have given   its investors a quick exit opportunity.However, appointing FireEye President Kevin Mandia as DeWalt's   successor was a smart move. Mandia founded Mandiant, the   cybersecurity company that revealed that an elite Chinese hacking   group was targeting U.S. government and corporate systems in   2013. FireEye acquired Mandiant for about $1 billion the   following year, and its machine-based security tech plays a   central role in its threat prevention services.Mandia's transition from president to CEO has been fairly   smooth. Mandiareportedly isn't interested in selling FireEye.   Instead, he'll likely focus on improving its long-term growth and   profitability instead of profiting from a quick sale. Under   Mandia the company also decided to lay off 300 to 400 of   FireEye's 3,400 workers.That move -- along with other cost-cutting initiatives -- are   aimed at reducing FireEye's annual costs by $80 million. We   already saw some progress last quarter, when its GAAP net loss   narrowed $0.13 from the prior-year quarter to $0.75 per share.   That bottom-line improvement is rare in the cybersecurity   industry. Next-gen firewall vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) , for example, saw its GAAP loss widen from $0.47 to   $0.69 per share last quarter.2. Expanding FireEye as a cloud-based serviceFireEye's sales growth slowed down due to waning demand for   its on-site appliances and rising demand for its cloud-based   services. That shift has been tough, since FireEye generates much   more revenue on the initial sale of an appliance than gaining new   subscriptions. But over time, these cloud-based subscriptions   become more dependable sources of long-term revenue.FireEye's main product for this market is FireEye as a Service   (FaaS), which continuously detects and analyzes threats without   the need for large security teams or managed security services   providers. In November, FireEye expanded that ecosystem with   Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid, which adds new private, hybrid, and   public cloud deployment options for mid-sized and larger   businesses.Mandia noted that these products still represented the ""early   phases of the richest new innovation cycle in our history,"" as   the cloud-based products would help ""customers elevate their   security profile at a lower total cost of ownership.""3. Turning FireEye into an all-in-one platformIn late November, FireEye introduced Helix -- an all-in-one   platform that bundles its network, endpoint, Threat Analytics   Platform, Advanced Threat Intelligence, and FireEye Security   Orchestrator together in a unified system with  a single   user interface. From that interface, users can add additional   services like FaaS, email, other threat detection tools, and even   integrate the platform with third-party threat intelligence   tools.This platform serves as the foundation of a ""FireEye   ecosystem,"" which widens its moat against tech giants likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , which bundles its security solutions with its   networking hardware and software. It also helps FireEye keep pace   with perimeter security rivals like Palo Alto, which launched a   comparable bundle dubbed the Next-Generation Security Platform   earlier this  year. FireEye still faces intense competition   from companies like Cisco and Palo Alto, but at least Helix helps   it lock in more customers and widen its moat.The key takeawayFireEye still has a lot to prove before I'd consider buying it   as a contrarian play.

TheS&P 500 Indeximproved 0.2% on Tuesday, theDow Jones Industrial Averagefinished 0.1% higher and theNasdaq Compositesurged 0.5% to hit a new record high. Still, Dow 20K remains   elusive.As we head into what's sure to be a light-volume Wednesday, a few   stocks are still worth a look. Today, we're focusing onGalena Biopharma Inc(NASDAQ:GALE),Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc(NASDAQ:ANTH) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F).makeArticleAd();Here's what you should know:Galena Biopharma Inc (GALE)GALE shares were booming in Wednesday's premarket trade   on news that the company's drug GALE-401 - which treats the rare   blood disorder, thrombocythemia - will be moving into   late-stage trials.GALE-401 is a controlled release formulation of anagrelide,   which reduces elevated platelet count and ameliorates associated   symptoms, including thrombo-hemorrhagic events. High platelet   counts can cause strokes and heart attacks.Galena's treatment is designed to slowly release the drug   throughout the body, cutting down on instances of side effects   that result from maximum or peak plasma concentrations following   administration.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Prior to the news, GALE shares were off more than 90%, fueled   by the discontinuation of a clinical trial for NeuVax. However,   the positive headline for GALE-401 has the stock up 25% in   response.Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc (ANTH)ANTH shares were on the other edge of the clinical trial   sword, tanking afterdisappointing results.Anthera's Sollpura is a medication that helps to treat   cystic fibrosis, specifically helping maldigestion in patients.   However, the drug ""narrowly"" missed its primary endpoint, sending   shares to the ground.One point of potential hope: The company said the study's   structure may have contributed to the failure.

No injuries have been   reported so far surrounding these crashes.If these Ford cars' brakes are found to have such a flaw, a   recall could follow in the near future. Rough or uneven surfaces   may also be to blame as the turbulence may cause the anti-lock   braking system to disarm. Such a landing could delay the effect   of the brakes stopping the vehicles, increasing the distance it   takes for the sedans to stop.Another recent Ford recall involves 2010 and 2011 Fusion   and Milan models due to fuel tanks that may crack.F shares were unchanged in premarket trading.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for       201710 Best Stocks for Retirement Investors5 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 2017The post3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Ford Motor   Company (F), Galena Biopharma Inc (GALE) and Anthera   Pharmaceuticals Inc (ANTH)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Cisco, Ericsson Partner to Get More Deals, Boost Top Line;12/27/2016;"Shares ofCisco Systems, Inc.CSCOhave performed more or less in line with the broaderZacks Computer Networkingindustry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry generated a positive return of 11.6%, the stock returned 12.4%.The not-so-impressive performance of the stock could be due to intensifying competition from several smaller players, slowing order growth from service providers and challenges in the emerging markets.Meanwhile, per a Reuters report, the company recently announced an expansion of the partnership it entered into in late 2015 with Ericsson. This is expected to position it better to win clients both in the corporate as well as the public sector.The objective of the partnership will be to generate $1 billion in revenues for each of the companies by 2018.What Does this Mean for Cisco?Notably, the Cisco-Ericsson alliance won more than 60 deals during the past year from clients mostly in the telecom operations business. In 2017, the companies will continue to focus on winning more deals from the enterprise and the public sector.On the one hand, the renewed partnership will enable Cisco to foray into new emerging markets amid a declining switching business. On the other hand, the alliance will help Ericsson to foray into sectors that have huge growth potential such as Internet of Things (IoT), enterprise security, Wi-Fi and data centers.As per an IDC report, the IoT ecosystem is estimated to be worth $1.7 trillion by 2020. Per another IDC report, worldwide spending on enterprise security is estimated to reach $3.21 billion by 2020 from $1.76 billion in 2015, representing a CAGR of 12.7%.Similarly, datacenters and Wi-Fi are also emerging sectors that have huge growth potential. Given the scope these segments offer, we expect the alliance between the two companies to meaningfully contribute to the top line of both the companies.CISCO SYSTEMS PriceCISCO SYSTEMS Price|CISCO SYSTEMS QuoteZacks RankAt present, Cisco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space are Lantronix, Inc.LTRXsporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.BRCDand IxiaXXIA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Tech Stocks 2016 Recap: Chips Up, FANGs Down;12/27/2016;"Technology stocks in 2016 didn't deliver the oomph investors expected. Not unlike, say, when powerhouse FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) lit up the market in 2015. But with year-to-date gains of almost 14%, compared to 9% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index, there's little for tech investors to complain about.Here's the thing, however: Unlike 2015, FANG stocks this year didn't do the heavy lifting and more of the wealth was shared among other tech names. The FANGs lost tons of bite and were pretty pedestrian in 2016. Take a look at the chart a few graphs below.After gaining 141% last year, Netflix shares have risen just 10% in 2016, marking the biggest drop among the FANGs on a percentage basis. This was followed by Amazon, which has gained about 12.5% year to date, falling from 120% returns last year.makeArticleAd();Meanwhile, Facebook and Alphabet, which have posted respective 2016 gains of 12% and 4%, struggled to duplicate their 2015 respective returns of 37% and 49%.In all four cases, expecting these companies to repeat their 2015 success would have been unrealistic. But with three out of the four names besting the or -- at least -- tracking the S&P 500 Index's 10% rise, the group didn't stink up the joint. And while Alphabet's 4% rise would seem as a disappointment, take it as a buying opportunity. I expect next year's recap will yield better results.All told, the FANGs were displaced by the likes AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA), which posted respective gains of 303% and 235%. Add in Qualcomm's (QCOM) 38% rise and you've got a nice chip party. All that's missing is the dip and soft drinks. Speaking of soft, Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 17% in 2016, seems rejuvenated under CEO Satya Nadella's cloud-first strategy. While 17% is nothing to brag about compared to AMD, Microsoft stock will end 2016 at near tech-bubble highs.Likewise, IBM (IBM), which has soared some 26% this year, will end the year as one of tech's biggest surprises. Raise your had if you saw Big Blue posting such green. Notably, despite suffering iPhone revenue and shipment declines, the fact that Apple (AAPL) has gained 13% in 2016 underscores the level of optimism investors have about 2017. It remains to be seen whether Apple can deliver. But with some $230 billion in cash on the balance sheet, a 2.00% dividend yield and new products on the way, taking a bite out of Apple never seems like a bad idea.By contrast, despite Twitter's (TWTR) 28% decline, it will be tough for the company to turn things around in 2017. Same with GoPro (GPRO), which lost some 50% of its value in 2016. But if either company gets acquired in 2017, all bets are off.Two stocks to keep an eye on are Intel (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO). Both pay respective dividend yields of 2.8% and 3.4% and are making strong headway in the Internet-of-Things, which is expected to be a huge market in 2017."

6 Tech Companies Investing Billions in Their Future;12/26/2016;"Staying relevant through constant innovation and disruption is   more important in the tech industry than in arguably any other   sector. By investing heavily in research and development   (R&D), these companies are making expensive bets on the   future and what technology and trends will lead it -- along with   their own sales and profits.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();6 companies investing billions in R&DTo compile this list, we looked at the total dollar amount   that publicly traded tech companies have each spent on R&D   over the past year. There are many companies investing heavily in   R&D, both by real dollar amount and also relative to their   own market cap., but here are the six companies that stood out as   shaping the future based on how much they have invested, and will   probably continue to do so, to be the ones at the forefront of   future development.CompanyMarket CapR&D Spend (Previous 12 Months)Alphabet Inc.$531 billion$13.8 billionIntel Corporation$176 billion$13 billionMicrosoft Corporation$468 billion$12.1 billionApple Inc.$582 billion$10 billionOracle Corporation$159 billion$6.5 billionCisco Systems, Inc.$148 billion$6.3 billionData source: Capital IQWhat those billions are going afterIt's not surprising thatAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  tops the list as the biggest   investor in the in the world in terms of R&D spend.   Alphabet's willingness to spend heavily on research into areas   such as self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and wearable   technology such as Google Glass and connected clothing shows how   the company is working to assure it has a place in the world far   beyond the internet search that currently makes up the vast   majority of its revenue. Alphabet's recent restructuring to make   Google one segment of the overall company was specifically   designed to allow the company to continue making audacious   moonshot bets.Alphabet's self-driving car project, now called Waymo. Image   source: Alphabet/Waymo.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently announced that it will release a device   to compete in the smart-home space. Powered by its Cortana   voice-enabled artificial intelligence platform, this device will   compete directly with similar products such as Google Home. Other   big investments in the past few years from Microsoft include   cloud computing and more work on its Windows operating system for   mobile devices and as an ""Internet of Things"" platform. It's yet   to be seen how Microsoft's recent acquisition of LinkedIn will   fully play out, but you can expect that it links up with some of   the areas Microsoft has been investing heavily in already.Intel,Oracle, andCisco Systemsare each working hard to keep their industry-dominating positions   from younger and more fast-paced companies within the   microprocessor, graphic chip, and computing network space. These   three behemoth companies have been building and developing   infrastructure for cloud computing, internet security, and other   digital-age network services that require new technology far   beyond what their own technology could handle in years past.   Building and preparing for these big growth trends in such a   fast-moving segment of the IT industry will like drive higher   R&D spending in these companies for years to come.Finally, there'sApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . This company has been the focus of much analysis   in the past few years for not releasing enough new and   astonishing tech, so much so that many of those analysts have   questioned if Apple's growth days are behind it. However, the   company is one of the biggest investors in R&D, seemingly   going after the connected-car market, artificial intelligence, or   other long-term investments such as building much more   comprehensive software platforms. What makes Apple especially   interesting is that it's by far the wealthiest company on the   list by total cash value, which was a record of nearly $238   billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities   in its most recent quarter. That's more than double the cash of   second-place Microsoft, with $117 billion.Preparing for bigger spending to comeIf those numbers don't already look massive enough, they could   get bigger in the coming years. Apple's $238 billion in cash? The   vast majority of that amount is stored offshore, where Apple is   holding it because the company doesn't want to pay the around 35%   corporate tax to repatriate it back to the United States.As part of a tax system overhaul, President-elect Donald   Trump has said he seeks to lower this corporate tax rate and   could even provide a special 10% tax for companies that are   seeking to repatriate a huge chunk of cash back to the States.The richest companies in the U.S., then, including many of the companies in the preceding list,   would probably then repatriate much of that cash and could put   the money to work in increased R&D spending.Like much of the potential changes coming to corporate tax or   other policy, there's no telling when this might happen, what the   final numbers will be, how much each of that overseas cash each   company would bring back, or what the companies will do with the   money. Still, either way, these companies and many like them are   likely to continue spending heavily on researching and developing   the next wave of new technology that will drive their industries   in the years ahead -- something that long-term investors won't   want to miss.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock’s Financials Are Good, But Technicals Are Better;12/23/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter getting burned throughout most of last decade,Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is taking acautious approachto their guidance for the new year. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, Cisco anticipates a drop in sales due to headwinds generated by a global competitive environment. CEO Chuck Robbins referenced uncertainties in the world economy, as well as potential regulations under the incoming Donald Trump administration.Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Although you can't go wrong erring on the side of caution, Cisco might be hedging their bets unnecessarily. There are a number of technology sectors in which the networking giant can leverage its power, key among them being theInternet of Things. This is a market that's projected to hit $1.7 trillion by the year 2020.makeArticleAd();Furthermore, the company has a division called ""IoT Systems and Software."" You can't get any more direct than that for CSCO stock!Understandably, with a lucrative market comes intense competition. The IoT business is unique in that it brings out aneclectic bunch.NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), andGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) are all competing in one form or another. Of course, you can't ignore industry titans likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT).Although that seems like a tough matchup for CSCO stock, I wouldn't short-change it.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017Arguably, Cisco is in the best position to advantage IoT, as it has the brains and the architecture. By default, the company can provide the physical connectivity through itsvast networks. Also, Cisco can offer security mechanisms and standardization measures for IoT device makers.Strong technical tailwinds for CSCO stockAll of these are wonderful reasons to consider buying up CSCO stock. However, what I like best is its technical momentum. Frankly, a fundamental story is only that - a story. The difference is whether or not investors are willing to risk money on it.Most indicators suggest that Cisco stock is poised for greater things in the coming years.Let's start with the low-hanging fruit. Year-to-date, Cisco shares are up over 12%. Based on recent trends, the actual return shouldn't be too far off from that figure. Yes, the price action has been a little choppy since the beginning of September. Nevertheless, CSCO stock is trading above its 50- and 200-day moving averages.I'm also encouraged by the substantive gains made in the wake of the ""Great Recession."" From 2008 until the end of 2011, CSCO stock returned a lousy -7%. But from 2012 onwards, it has been a different company altogether, with Cisco averaging 14% in the black. If it weren't for a volatile 2015, the average would be much higher.Even then, you have to love how CSCO stock just brushed the negativity aside.Cisco Stock Broke Past a Key Resistance LevelClick to EnlargeMoving forward, the prospects for Cisco are bright for investors.I say this because the company busted open a long-term resistance level. In 2007, the average high on an adjusted basis was a little over $28. This is approximately the same price point where Cisco stock faltered last year. As previously mentioned, it picked itself up in impressive fashion. More importantly, shares are convincingly above the bearish ceiling.If CSCO stock had failed, we would be looking at a double-top formation. Bearish traders would have noted that the bulls attempted to push Cisco above a psychological threshold without success. That could have led to a self-fulfilling prophesy, engendering further panic.Fortunately, that's not how things turned out. I would argue that with the breakthrough, CSCO stock has a clean slate. Combined with its enormous strength and financial stability, this is a company on the rise. Unless there was an absolutely compelling reason to bet against Cisco stock, investors are much safer going long.Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock or Nike Inc (NKE):     Which to Own in 2017?Of course, tech is hardly a consistent and reliable sector. Innovation occurs in a heartbeat. Getting things wrong ever so slightly can trigger heavy consequences years down the road. But despite these pitfalls, CSCO stock has proven its worth. The IoT business should be an exciting era for Cisco and its better positioned than most of its competitors.But the most important consideration is that people are buying the story. That goes so much further than any other analysis.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 201710 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for     2017The postCisco Systems, Inc.

Bull of the Day: Broadcom (AVGO);12/22/2016;"Broadcom(AVGO) is a textbook example of how the Zacks Rank can keep you invested in a growth stock quarter after quarter to ride meaningful long-term gains, or simply to trade the swings along the way. And another ""beat and raise"" quarter has AVGO back to the top of investor buy lists.makeZacksArticleAd();Since I first discovered this blue-chip technology ""arms dealer"" back in 2014 when it was trading $70, and still named Avago Technologies, it has quadrupled revenues to over $13 billion primarily through key acquisitions like LSI Logic and Broadcom, its new namesake.Today we'll look at why AVGO (they kept the original Avago stock symbol) remains a favorite among institutional investors, which is really the same reason it consistently earns the highest Zacks rank every quarter: earnings momentum.3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure if AT&T (T), Cisco (CSCO), or Alphabet (GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol. More on this ""need for speed"" in a moment.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApple(AAPL) with radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.Here was part of a recent press release which explains well the infrastructure technology that makes them what I call the blue chip ""arms dealer"" for the 100G connected world...SAN JOSE, Calif. and SINGAPORE, Dec. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO), a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions, today announced shipments of its latest series of heterogeneous knowledge-based processors (KBPs), the BCM15000 (BCM15K), designed for modern network infrastructure including core, edge and data center routers and switches. The BCM15K is a new series of 16nm KBPs which integrates TCAM, SRAM and algorithmic search technology to enable unprecedented levels of forwarding, classification and security for service provider routers and switches. Compared with previous generation KBP products, the BCM15K delivers internet search speeds up to 7.2 billion searches per second (BSPS) and aggregate data transfer rates up to 1 terabit per second (Tbps), which are 8x and 3x improvements, respectively.As global internet traffic will soon surpass a zettabyte on an annual basis and bandwidth-intensive applications such as cloud computing and video streaming continue to expand, next-generation networks would need more advanced routers and switches that are capable of handling terabit bandwidth and performing multi-billion packet search operations per second. Efficiently supporting these applications at these speeds means next-generation routers and switches would need a specialized, high performing KBP that has advanced Layer 2 to Layer 4 packet header processing capabilities enabling service providers to deliver services with QoS and security guarantees.(end of Broadcom PR)After AVGO's recent ""beat and raise"" report, the analysts chimed in with a handful all choosing to bump their price target to $210, while Sanford Bernstein and Oppenheimer opted for $215.B. Riley not to be outdone by anyone, raised their PT from $225 to $235.Oppenheimer analysts titled their post-earning report ""Christmas Came Early"" and summarized their views thus on December 9...We are raising our estimates and PT on AVGO following management's latest beat/ raise. F4Q (Oct.) revenue/EPS of $4.15B/$3.47 bested consensus' $4.12B/$3.36E. F1Q (Jan.) revenue/GM guidance of $4.08B/61.5% also easily topped estimates of $3.97B/60.5%. We continue to see AVGO as mis-priced atAs I've told my followers since September, ""you should be accumulating AVGO shares at $165 and under."" That was the rough floor of the consolidation for 3 months. And the idea is paying off. I expect it to continue to pay above $200 in the first half of 2017.Disclosure: I own shares of AVGO.Zacks' best stocks under $10As a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy, today's Bull of the Day has a short-term 1 to 3-month profit zone.

The Best Dividend Stocks in the Dow Averages;12/22/2016;"It's been a strange year for high-yielding stocks. In the first half of 2016, the Dow Jones utility average, a proxy for hefty dividend payers, was a market leader, rising 26%. Since then, however, it has tumbled 6%. And it has been a notable laggard during the post-election rally, falling 1% since November 8, while the broad market, as measured by Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, advanced 6%.What's a yield-seeking investor to think now, with a lot of hot money chasing stocks that should benefit from rising rates (such as financials) and faster economic growth (such as industrial manufacturers and producers of steel, copper and other materials)?makeArticleAd();Portfolio managers suggest that in this environment it makes sense to invest in companies that should deliver both above-average dividend growth and above-average earnings. We analyzed the 65 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial, transportation and utility averages and came up with 10 that meet those criteria and should provide investors with solid returns. We focused on this universe because inclusion in one of the Dow averages is a testament to a company's size and financial strength. The market capitalization of the smallest company on our list is $55.7 billion.The stocks have an average yield of 2.7%, and all but one yield more than the average 2.1% yield of the S&P 500 index.ChevronIf you're bullish onoil prices, Chevron is attractive, says Paul Franzen, a senior analyst with the Commerce Value Fund. And it looks much more appealing than ExxonMobil (XOM), the world's biggest publicly traded energy company and also a member of the Dow Jones industrials.Chevron should see annual production of oil and gas rise by 5% over the next three years, compared with 1% per year for Exxon. In addition, Exxon has a lot of exposure to refining and chemicals, which Chevron does not. That would be a relative plus for Chevron because rising crude prices pressure refining and chemical profits.Chevron has a number of assets that should deliver solid returns with oil prices back in the $50-a-barrel area and perhaps heading higher. One particularly attractive holding is the roughly 2 million acres it owns in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the second-largest oil field in the world. Analyst Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James thinks this holding could be worth $30 billion, or about 14% of the company's market cap.Beyond the Permian Basin, one of Chevron's two huge liquefied natural gas facilities in Australia just went online, and the other one will go online soon. Another advantage for Chevron is that a relatively small amount of its assets are in global hot spots or politically unattractive locations. For instance, only 2% of its reserves are in the Middle East (compared with 13% for its competitors, other enormous multinational energy companies), and none are in Russia (compared with 12% for its rivals).Don't put too much stock in the 313% earnings growth that analysts expect Chevron to deliver next year. The figure is large because profits remained depressed in 2016 due to the recent crash in oil prices. By the same token, because of the profit slump, Chevron's unappetizing price-earnings ratio is inflated by weak profits. Even during tough times, though, Chevron has been a generous dividend payer. It has boosted its payout by an average of 9% annually since 2005.Ultimately, the price of oil will be the key driver of Chevron's share price. Molchanov, who thinks oil will average $80 a barrel in 2017, compared with $52.40 today, says Chevron is more sensitive to crude prices than its main competitors. ""It's good to be oily,"" he says.See Also:27 Best Stocks to Buy Now for 2017Cisco SystemsThe networking giant's stock price is almost exactly where it was 10 years ago. Growth remains sluggish, with revenues having climbed just 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (ending in October) over the same period a year earlier.Tax cuts favored by President-elect Donald Trump, including a lower corporate tax rate and a cut in taxes on profits repatriated from outside the U.S., would help Cisco, but there are other reasons to like the stock. Cisco is beginning to emerge as a network-security powerhouse. That business generated $2 billion in revenues in fiscal 2017, and security revenues rose 11% in the August-October quarter. Granted, many old tech companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), are heralding their security chops, but Cisco's annual haul is already bigger than that of Palo Alto Networks (PANW), the leading standalone security firm.In the switching and router markets, meanwhile, Cisco is fighting against companies making hot new machines and others just trying to replicate Cisco's offerings at a lower price. Cisco's solution? It is trying to bundle software with its hardware and convince customers to pay for the software via an annual subscription payment. Overall, subscription revenues grew by 33% in the fiscal year that ended in July 2016, and Cisco now derives half of its security revenues from software or by subscription (the rest is from hardware sales). ""The strategy is working,"" says Jennifer Chang, manager of the Cullen High Dividend Equity Fund.Chang thinks the company can deliver mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth over the next three to five years. ""The dividend can grow even faster,"" she says. In fact, Cisco in February raised its quarterly payout by an eye-popping 24%. And the stock looks cheap, selling for 30% less than the S&P 500's P/E of 17.NextEra EnergySome people might think the election results precipitated a perfect storm for NextEra Energy. As a member of the Dow utility average, not only is the stock sensitive to interest rates--which have been rising since Election Day--the company is also the utility sector's renewable-energy leader. And Trump seems to favor fossil fuels much more than renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.NextEra's stock has fallen nearly 4%% since the election. But that may not be just an overreaction; instead, it may be a move in the wrong direction. Many of the tax credits that the company--and its customers--get for solar and wind projects will last through the end of 2019, then start to phase out, eventually disappearing at the end of 2022. And many wind and solar projects make economic sense without any tax credits at all.In addition to serving fast-growing Florida, NextEra has grown by signing 20-year energy deals with industrial clients such as General Electric (GE). Many more agreements should follow. The company expects its earnings per share to rise by 6% to 8% a year through 2018, with dividends growing considerably faster, at an annual rate of 12% to 14%.See Also:8 Great Dividend-Paying Stocks in the Russell 2000 IndexJohnson & JohnsonIf you're worried that drug prices might be subject to government price controls but still want to own a large pharmaceutical company, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better choice than Johnson & Johnson. That's because in J&J's most recently reported quarter (July-September), the company derived only 47% of its sales from drugs. Medical devices accounted for 35%, and consumer products, such as Band-Aids, Listerine and Tylenol, were responsible for the rest.And if you are looking for dividend growth and dependability, you need look no further. J&J has increased its annual payout for 53 consecutive years. A tax cut on repatriated earnings might help boost the payout further, given that almost all of the more than $40 billion in cash and securities on J&J's balance sheet is held overseas.With revenues and earnings expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate over the next few years, it is reasonable to expect annual dividend growth of 6% to 8%. J&J has achieved $1 billion in productivity gains over the past three years. And in January, it announced that it would eliminate 3,000--or 6%--of the jobs in its medical-devices division.Bears worry about the loss of J&J's patent for the company's top-selling drug, Remicade, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment that generates $6.6 billion in annual sales. After a judge invalidated the patent in August, Pfizer introduced a rival drug (called a biosimilar because it is made from biological components) in November. But Pfizer priced the drug only 15% lower than Remicade, less of a discount than investors initially feared. And J&J says that it has positioned itself to withstand the assault, noting that patients with commercial insurance pay just $5 per dose with a Remicade co-pay card (a discount card issued by the drug's manufacturer) and that 48% of Remicade patients with commercial insurance have no co-pay whatsoever.Analysts say J&J has a strong pipeline of drugs in development, so the company, which was founded 130 years ago, may have another century or two of growth ahead of it. And, who knows, it might raise its dividend annually for the next 53 years as well.United Parcel ServiceKnown as Brown, for the color of its ubiquitous trucks and the uniforms of their drivers, UPS is a powerhouse not just in the U.S. Only three companies move packages internationally--FedEx (FDX) and DHL are the others--and UPS is by far the most efficient. Plus, overseas revenues are growing faster than in the U.S. From 2016 to 2019, the company expects revenues in the U.S. to rise by 5% to 6% a year, compared with international revenue growth of 6% to 9% annually. It expects earnings to increase by 9% to 13% annually.Another plus for UPS: It pays a high federal corporate tax rate of 34% to 36%, so it could benefit from tax reform. ""It is one of the reasons you could see profit-margin expansion,"" says Matt Moulis, manager of the Fidelity Select Transportation Fund, which has UPS as its second-largest holding. Moreover, he says, ""a significant portion of the business is recurring, including the shipment of staples and holiday gifts.""Since going public in 1999, UPS, a member of the Dow transportation average, has lifted its dividend at a 10% annual pace. Expect that to continue. But what about future competition from Amazon, which has been buying cargo planes of late? So far, it seems the e-commerce giant is simply trying to find a way to make on-time deliveries at peak gift-giving times. Still, e-commerce now accounts for more than 40% of UPS business, and investors have to be alert to changes afoot at Amazon. But UPS has shown it can be flexible. To execute ""not-at-home"" deliveries, it has created 27,000 worldwide access points where customers can pick up their packages.SEE ALSO:8 Best 'YARP' Stocks for Dividend InvestorsMicrosoftAt Microsoft's last shareholders meeting, in November, CEO Satya Nadella said that by 2025 the world will produce 180 zettabytes of data. (A zettabyte is sextillion bytes, or 10 to the 21st power bytes.) No wonder the world needs the cloud. And Microsoft's mastery of the cloud is a big part of the company's growth story. ""Microsoft's cloud is now competitive with Amazon Web Services,"" says Ramona Persaud, manager of the Fidelity Dividend Growth Fund.At the end of the fiscal year that ended June 30, Microsoft was generating cloud revenue at an annualized rate of more than $12 billion, an increase of slightly more than 50% from the previous year. Nadella says cloud revenue will reach $20 billion by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. As the business expands, profit margins should improve.Other parts of the business are also prospering and offsetting weak sales of operating systems and applications software for the stagnant personal computer market. Sales of the Surface tablet rose by 65% in fiscal 2016, to $3.6 billion; 49 million customers subscribe monthly to Xbox Live; and search engine Bing just became profitable. Analysts also think Microsoft will be able to find new sources of revenue from LinkedIn, the business- and employment-oriented social network that it recently purchased for $26 billion.Analysts and fund managers are effusive in their praise for Nadella, who became CEO in 2014. ""Nadella is very shareholder-friendly,"" says Fidelity's Persaud. And investors may soon realize just how friendly. Microsoft has $137 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet, almost all of it held abroad. If the tax on repatriated earnings is reduced, Microsoft shareholders are likely to see more dividend increases and share buybacks.United TechnologiesIf you screen for companies that are expected to generate superior earnings growth in 2017, you won't find United Technologies. In fact, profits at the industrial conglomerate--which owns, among other things, aircraft-engine maker Pratt & Whitney, Otis Elevator and Carrier, the maker of heating and air-conditioning systems--are likely to be flat to down next year, with revenues climbing only modestly.The culprit, says Don Taylor, manager of the Franklin Rising Dividend Fund, is Pratt & Whitney's investment in its new PurePower Geared Turbofan jet engines, which reduce fuel use and ground noise in jetliners. The revolutionary jet engine burns 16% less fuel than conventional engines and reduces noise by 75%, while also significantly cutting carbon dioxide emissions. The company has invested about $10 billion in the new engines, and sales are just starting to ramp up.United Technologies is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of commercial aviation all over the world. Increased defense spending during a Trump administration would also help. The company projects that Pratt & Whitney sales will rise at an annual rate of 10% or more from 2016 through 2020. And the company is optimistic about its other divisions as well. It sees annual sales gains of 5% to 7% in aerospace systems, 4% to 5% in climate controls and security (in addition to providing heating and cooling systems, the company is a key player in the creation of intelligent, energy-efficient buildings), and 4% to 5% for Otis elevators, escalators and moving walkways. If those growth targets are achieved, United Technologies should deliver double-digit earnings growth and raise its dividend by 8% to 9% a year starting in 2018.United made headlines recently because of the deal its Carrier division struck with President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, still Indiana's governor, to keep some jobs at Carrier's Indiana furnace plant. How this drama will play out for Carrier and the rest of United Technologies once Trump and Pence take office remains uncertain. In the meantime, investors can pick up this blue-chip industrial company, which will benefit from any pickup in global growth, at a reasonable price.SEE ALSO:8 Great Stocks to Own in RetirementJP Morgan ChaseLike other financial stocks, JP Morgan has been on a tear since the election, rising 24%. But it may not be too late to hop aboard. The company should benefit from rising interest rates and less-demanding regulation, as well as faster economic growth, if that materializes. As its business has improved, the banking giant has been adding capital to its balance sheet. Each year, regulators have been allowing the bank to return more cash to shareholders, a trend that should continue, with a positive impact on dividends and stock buybacks.If the corporate tax rate goes down to 20%, JP Morgan's earnings, by one estimate, would rise by about 20%. And if the Federal Reserve does indeed raise short-term interest rates three times in 2017, as it recently suggested it would, that would also boost the bank's earnings and, presumably, its stock price. More good news: CEO Jamie Dimon told the Wall Street Journal recently that JPMorgan's bond-trading business has been much stronger lately. Bond-trading revenues have dropped 35% from their 2009 peak, and Dimon now thinks the company can recover half of that decline.In evaluating JP Morgan, it's important to recognize that European bank regulators have been tougher than their counterparts in the U.S. This has given JP Morgan a big edge over rivals such as Barclays (BCS) and Deutsche Bank (DB). Another positive that hasn't shown up in earnings yet but may someday is the slew of dreadful headlines earned by competitor Wells Fargo (WFC). ""JP Morgan is the best of the big banks,"" says Commerce Value's Franzen.Union PacificLike other railroads, Union Pacific has had a grim 2016, a result of low energy prices. Industrywide, the number of carloads fell 6.9% in the first nine months of 2016 (compared with the first nine months of 2015), with coal and oil shipments leading the decline. Union Pacific stock is 15% off its record high, set in February 2015. Cheap energy prices have been hurting Union Pacific in two ways. Low prices led many power plants to shift to natural gas instead of coal. And low gasoline prices made truckers a more attractive alternative for the shipment of some goods.But with the rise in the price of natural gas and oil, analysts have become more bullish on Union Pacific and, on average, are calling for a 10% earnings gain next year. And that estimate may be low if the economy turns out to be stronger than expected and oil prices rise further or even remain stable.The company handled the downturn wisely, reducing capital expenditures in the face of declining demand. But UP continued to reward shareholders, raising its dividend by 10% and boosting its share repurchase plan. The company has bought back 305 million shares since 2007 at an average price of $59.63, well below the current level. Union Pacific's high tax rate may also make it an attractive investment. Its 2015 tax rate was 37.7%, so it could see a significant earnings pop if corporate tax rates are reduced.New federal regulations on truckers may also help the company. By the end of 2017, the nation's truckers will have to install an electronic logging device that will monitor vehicle speeds and locations. That will make it much harder for a driver to spend more hours on the road in a day than regulations permit.DuPontDuPont is not your grandfather's chemical company. Today, 45% of its revenues come from agriculture, with another 10% from its electronics and communications division.McKinsey & Company projects that crop demand for human consumption and animal feed will at least double by 2050. Given that 20% of what used to be farmland is no longer available for that purpose because of erosion and pollution, according to McKinsey, companies, such as DuPont, that improve agricultural efficiency will become increasingly valuable.DuPont is also profiting from the trend toward healthier eating. It is a major player in nutritional additives, including vitamins. It is also helping dieters. When combined, two of its additives--Supro Soy Protein and Litesse dietary fiber--make consumers feel fuller for longer after a meal, thus reducing their cravings for more food. Meanwhile, the stock is actually cheaper than its P/E of 21 suggests. DuPont is scheduled to complete its merger with Dow Chemical (DOW) in the first quarter of 2017. If the two companies were combined today, they would have a blended P/E of 17 and a combined dividend yield of 2.6%. Moreover, in late 2018 or early 2019, the chemicals behemoth will become three separate public companies: One will focus on agriculture; the second, material sciences (among other things, this unit creates new materials, such as DuPont's Kevlar bulletproof vests); and the third, specialty products in nutrition and electronics.Bill Selesky, a senior analyst at Argus Research, is bullish on DuPont. He thinks the merger will help DuPont and Dow realize $3 billion in cost cuts and at least $1 billion in additional revenues. ""The two companies are talking about raising the dividend,"" he says, ""and some major trends should help them. The world's population will grow from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion by 2050, which should significantly benefit its huge agriculture business.""QUIZ:How Well Do You Know Dividends?"

Will 2017 Be Palo Alto Networks Inc's Worst Year Yet?;12/21/2016;"Shares ofPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) have fallen nearly 30% this year, due to slowing   sales growth, widening GAAP losses, and the threat of rising   competition. By comparison, thePureFunds ISE Cybersecurity ETF(NYSEMKT: HACK) -- which owns a basket of top   cybersecurity-related stocks -- rose 4% during that period.Will Palo Alto fall even further next year? Let's take a   closer look at its tailwinds, headwinds, and valuation to find   out.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Palo Alto's tailwindsThe good news for Palo Alto -- which is bad news for   companies, governments, and other organizations -- is that the   number of data breaches is rising worldwide. That's why the   global security market could grow from $122.45 billion today    to $202.36 billion by 2021, according to Research and   Markets.Palo Alto is widely considered the ""best in breed"" provider of   next-gen firewalls. It serves over 35,000 customers in more than    140 countries, and has added over 1,000 new customers per   quarter for 20 straight quarters. Over 85 of the Fortune 100 and   half of the Global 2000 companies use its services, andGartnerhas ranked it as an enterprise firewall market leader for   the past five years.That growing customer base boosted Palo Alto's revenue by 49%   to $1.4 billion last year, and analysts expect its sales to rise   another 31% this year. Its non-GAAP earnings more than doubled to   $152.6 million last year, and Wall Street expects that figure to   rise another 67% this year.Looking ahead, Palo Alto's Next-Generation Security Platform   -- which bundles together natively integrated technologies,   automated protection solutions, and threat intelligence sharing   solutions in an all-in-one  platform -- could widen its moat   against bigger tech companies likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andSymantec(NASDAQ: SYMC) . Palo Alto is also frequently cited as a   potential takeover target for those larger companies, but its   enterprise value of $11 billion makes it a pretty big buy.Palo Alto's headwindsOn the surface, Palo Alto looks like a great growth play. But   if we dig beneath the headline numbers, the cracks start   appearing. The first issue is its slowing sales growth. Its   revenue rose 34% annually to $398.1 million last quarter, but   that missed estimates by $2.1 million and represented its slowest   growth rate since its IPO in 2012.That slowdown was attributed to slower enterprise spending,   tougher competition in the firewall market, and a market shift   from on-site appliances to automated solutions and   subscription-based software and services. Those headwinds might   be acceptable for a company with a lower valuation, but Palo   Alto's price-to-sales ratio of 8 leaves little room for   disappointment.The second issue is its widening GAAP losses. Last quarter,   Palo Alto's GAAP loss widened from $39.9 million in the prior   year quarter to $61.8 million. That loss was mainly caused by its   stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses, which surged 55%   annually and claimed 29% of its revenues. Unless Palo Alto can   get those costs under control, many investors will likely   question its ability to ever generate a real profit.Lastly, competition in the firewall and perimeter security   market remains fierce. Cisco bundles technologies it gained by   acquiring Sourcefire, ThreatGRID, and  other smaller   security companies into its networking hardware and software.   Symantec dramatically expanded its end-to-end security   capabilities with the acquisitions of Blue Coat and LifeLock, andFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) has bundled additional security services into its   next-gen firewalls. If Palo Alto increases its R&D or sales   and marketing expenses to counter those threats, its SBC expenses   will likely spike and cause its GAAP losses to widen.Why 2017 won't be Palo Alto's worst year yet2017 won't likely be Palo Alto's ""worst"" year ever. That title   will still belong to 2016, which saw the stock's worst full-year   performance since its IPO. But 2017 also probably won't be a   turnaround year for the stock, unless it can either report   accelerating sales growth or narrower GAAP losses.10 stocks we like better than Palo Alto     NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Cisco Systems Could Have a Great 2017;12/20/2016;"Networking hardware giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) has been cautious when talking about its outlook   for the new year. The company is anticipating a revenue decline   during its fiscal second quarter, driven by what the company   calls ""a challenging global business environment."" CEO Chuck   Robbins pointed to macroeconomic uncertainty as well as   uncertainty surrounding the political and regulatory environments   following the election as the main reasons for the weak guidance.   The company is taking a conservative approach and not modeling   any improvement in these areas going forward.Cisco's guidance may be too pessimistic. Analysts from Cowen   & Co. recently surveyed 118 IT executives in the U.S. to   gather clues about how the IT spending environment would evolve   next year. While there was some uncertainty among those surveyed   due to the results of the election, Cowen found that the majority   expect IT budgets to grow next year. Networking infrastructure   was viewed by the executives as a high priority, suggesting that   Cisco may be in better shape than its outlook suggests.makeArticleAd();Image source: Cisco Systems.Good news for CiscoAccording to the survey, 75% of executives expect IT budgets   in 2017 to be higher than in 2016, with average growth of 6%.   Networking is viewed as an area that will grow its share of the   total IT budget, with 58% of executives expecting networking to   eat up a larger portion of IT spending next year. Just 2% are   expecting a decrease.Networking spending may grow substantially faster than overall   IT spending growth. 38% of surveyed executives expect an 11%   increase in networking spending next year, while 59% expect a 6%   increase. Cowen pointed out that these numbers aren't quite as   strong as in its May 2016 survey, but they still point to solid   networking spending growth in 2017.Cisco also came up in the survey questions, and the results   paint a picture that conflicts with the company's gloomy outlook.   Thirty-five percent of executives plan to spend more with Cisco   in 2017, while 36% expect to spend the same amount, and just 3%   expect to spend less. When asked which vendor they currently use   for ""digital initiatives,"" Cisco was the response 62% of the   time.The Cowen analysts summed up the results of the   survey: ""Undercutting what appears to be the widely held   view among investors of the imminent demise of Networking,   responses to our 4Q16 IT Survey indicate a relatively favorable   outlook for the Networking industry in general and for CSCO in   particular.""What to watch in 2017Cisco's switching and routing businesses -- the core of the   company that accounted for 45% of revenue during fiscal 2016 --   have been volatile in recent quarters. Switching revenue was flat   in fiscal 2016, with some up quarters and some down quarters, and   routing revenue slumped 4%.Image source: Cisco Systems.Neither is really a growth business at this point, but the   survey results suggest that both businesses could produce some   growth in 2017. This comes at a good time - two of Cisco's   smaller growth businesses, data center and collaboration, hit a   wall during the first quarter. Both segments suffered a 3%   year-over-year revenue decline, raising some questions about   their ability to drive growth for the company going forward.What Cowen calls ""digital initiatives"" in the survey likely   encompasses many things, but security may be the most important   for Cisco. The company's security business continues to grow at a   double-digit pace, in part driven by acquisitions. With demand   for cybersecurity expected to grow briskly in the coming years,   Cisco is in great position to benefit.While the results of Cowen's survey don't guarantee that Cisco   will have a great 2017, they provide a data point that should   make Cisco investors a little less concerned about the company's   lackluster outlook.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Technology Stock Roundup: Alphabet Spins Off Waymo;12/20/2016;"Last week saw the Fed raising rates and the markets jumping up in response. As far as technology companies are concerned, AlphabetGOOGLspun off its self-driving car business, CiscoCSCOand AristaANETsaw some wins in their long-running patent infringement battles while YahooYHOOannounced the biggest ever hack ever.So here are the top stories-Alphabet's WaymoWaymo, or ""a new way forward in mobility"" is the new name for Alphabet's self-driving car unit, which the company spun out from its X Labs last week. Heavy investments will likely continue, as the separation appears to be for operational flexibility/independence rather than separate financial reporting.The goals are now more clearly-defined at this stage: in the words of CEO John Krafcik, ""We're not in the business of making better cars. We're in the business of making better drivers."" That leaves several options including ""personal vehicles, ridesharing, logistics or solving last mile problems for public transport.""The ride hailing effort in partnership with Fiat Chrysler, is expected to launch by 2017-end. It will be entering a crowded and highly competitive market where Uber, Lyft and several automakers are also looking to enter.Google has reportedly made the greatest progress in developing self-driving technology (the unit has been 8 years in incubation with the technology powering 2 million self-driving miles), but this will be a market where regulatory control will be significant, competition will be stiff and there will be a war over who controls the data thus generated. It's unlikely to have a single clear winner.Read more:Alphabet's Autonomous Car Project Spins into a New CompanyCisco-Arista: Battles Won But The War Is OnCisco and Arista (founded and headed by former Cisco employees) have taken their rivalry to the courtroom. Cisco understandably has a huge number of patents in networking technology and its clinging on for dear life as it attempts to make inroads into the new-age software defined space. Upstart Arista on the other hand has more software defined technology, but there's still reliance on some basic networking technology, which is the reason for their long-running legal battles.Both companies had some wins last week. In Cisco's favor was the ITC ruling, which found that Arista infringed on two out of an alleged six Cisco patents. But there will be a review (to be completed in Apr 2017) and Arista is already developing a workaround for one. The other patent will expire in 2018. The ITC, which can only ban import of infringing products is therefore unlikely to have a huge impact on Arista. Read more:Cisco Wins Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against AristaLater in the week, a federal jury decided that while Arista infringed on other Cisco patents related to command line interface (CLI) technology, it didn't owe Cisco any damages. The case was decided on the doctrine of ""scènes à faire,"" which can be invoked in cases where certain creative works were the result of circumstances rather than creative pursuit, for example, where software needs to be compatible with technical standards or certain hardware.Cisco asked for $335 million in damages for Arista's infringing of over 500 CLI commands. Cisco will appeal the decision and a representative told the press, ""We respectfully disagree with the verdict."" Read more:Cisco Receives Adverse Ruling Against Arista in CaliforniaYahoo HackedYahoo has now announced the second major data breach, this one being the largest to date involving names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers related to a billion customers. Moreover, the company believes that this attack, which took place in 2013, was different from the one announced in September, when data related to 500 million accounts was compromised.People familiar to discussions at Verizon are now saying that the company is looking to renegotiate the purchase price, last fixed at around $4.8 billion. Verizon does have that option: citing the ""material adverse effect"" clause, which has reportedly been used for just this purpose in Delaware, where Yahoo is domiciled. It hasn't ever been used to terminate merger agreements. This can extend the date of closure as the companies determine the total financial impact of the data breaches.So far, there is no indication that Verizon won't go through with the deal.The FBI and senators are also looking into the matter to see if Yahoo's security measures were adequate, or whether there was any negligence involved.Read more:Yahoo!'s Latest Data Breach to Jeopardize Verizon Deal?CompanyLast  WeekLast 6 MonthsYTDAAPL+1.76%+21.64%+10.16%FB+0.16%+5.20%+15.22%GOOGL+0.05%+10.65%+7.00%MSFT+0.53%+24.25%+15.08%INTC+1.58%+12.92%+7.25%CSCO+1.76%+6.07%+16.44%AMZN-1.41%+5.95%+14.09%Other stories -CorporatePorsche Engineer Joins Apple: It was revealed last week that AppleAAPLhad, earlier this year, nabbed the technical director of Porsche's race car program who was instrumental in taking the company back to endurance racing. Alexander Hitzinger helped Volkswagen-owned Porsche develop the 919 hybrid sports car from scratch and took the team from ten to over 150 in the process.Apple in Softbank Tech Fund: Apple has decided to invest up to a billion dollars in Softbank's Vision Fund. The company will be able to use its overseas cash (currently around $200 billion) for the purpose. Around half of the cash raised by the fund (around $50 billion) will be ploughed back in to the U.S. to create manufacturing or other capacity and resulting in jobs growth.Apple Investment in Indonesia: The country became the latest of the emerging markets looking to drive FDI. It has now ruled that starting from Jan 2017, all 4G handsets sold there must have a local content of at least 30% that can be met with hardware, software or an investment commitment. Apple, after committing to spend $44 million in a research and development center in Indonesia over the next three years will be allowed to sell its latest iPhones in the country.Samsung OLED for Apple: JP Morgan's JJ Park, as quoted by Barron's says, ""We expect one of three iPhone models in 2017 to use OLED and the total supply volume to be in the 70M range,followed by a sharp increase in 2018. We think the technology and capacity gap between competitors is high, and our base-case assumption is that Samsung will be a sole supplier until 2018.""Samsung May Spin Out Foundry Business: Business Korea reported that Samsung may spin off its foundry business as a separate unit after Apple took its A10 manufacturing business to Taiwan Semiconductor.More on Facebook Fake News: While voicing a desire to not become arbiters of truth, FacebookFBhas appointed a group of third-party fact checking organizations in Poynter's International Fact Checking Network that conservatives view as left-leaning. Worse, this group has the authority to flag stories as ""disputed"" that Facebook will rank lower. It will also prevent the stories from being promoted or advertised. Sharing by a user will be allowed but the disputed flag will pop up whenever there is an attempt to share.Facebook Occulus Splits: Facebook has split its AR/VR effort into two groups, one focused on the PC side of things and the other, mobile. Brendan Iribe who co-founded Occulus and headed the unit after it was sold to Facebook, will now head the PC focused effort.Microsoft Fund: MicrosoftMSFThas created an AI-focused fund, in which it has invested a billion dollars. The fund will be focused on driving standards in the segment and investing in startups that will help develop the market or the technology.New Technology/ProductsDual-SIM iPhone: Apple may be thinking of launching a dual SIM iPhone for customers in India, China and some other emerging markets where the feature is popular. The advantages of dual SIM include having separate work and personal phone numbers and the ability to take advantage of deals from more than one carrier.Apple ties closely with carriers in North America, Europe, Japan and some other markets, so the dual SIM feature probably won't work there. But since smartphone growth will largely come from emerging markets in the next few years, the move makes sense. The patents for the technology were registered by people in Apple's employ.Apple Airpods: Three months after they were announced, Apple is now ready to take orders for its new wireless headphones. But supply seems limited because delivery times were pushed back four weeks within just a few years. The $159 devices have practically missed the holiday season, which is perhaps the first times this has happened to Apple. Technology websites reported that the wireless headphones are smart (Siri gets activated if you simply tap on them). They are however expensive to replace or repair (Apple will charge $69 a piece if you damage or lose any one).Facebook Wants Original Video Content: Facebook is reportedly looking to acquire both scripted and unscripted programming and sports to boost its video offering. It isn't clear yet whether this is just a start or whether it will get deeper into the content creation business. This would diversify its revenue but hugely increase costs/shrink margins and probably not be worth the effort.Cisco Closes Cloud Unit: Cisco, which had committed to spend a billion dollars on its Intercloud service has now decided to shutter the unit. The company will help its customers transition to other public cloud providers, such as Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure. This wouldn't be the first time that such a thing happened, the two big cloud infrastructure providers and more specifically, Amazon, have been nabbing customers at regular intervals on the strength of their broad offerings and large number of partnerships.Amazon Echo Expansion: Amazon scored a major win at Wynn Las Vegas that will equip all its 4,748 rooms with the AI-powered Echo devices. The voice controlled personal assistant device market is heating up although Amazon is well ahead of the others. Google's Home device still has a long way to go and Microsoft only just announced an agreement with Harman for a Harman-branded Cortana powered device.M&A and CollaborationsGoogle Acquires Wearables Startup: Google has acquired a wearables company called Chronologics, which has developed a smartwatch OS and a device called the CoWatch. The device supports Amazon Alexa and can be instructed through voice commands to do things like ordering food or getting weather reports.Some NumbersPixel Bite from Apple iPhone:Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity reduced his iPhone sales estimates. Accordingly, March quarter estimates have gone from 56 million to 53 million units and June quarter from 46 million to 44 million units. The 7 and 7S will lead to slight growth on a year over year basis through calendar 2017 with iPhone 8 leading to higher growth rates the following year. The analyst says that after the first four weeks of launch, iPhone 7 sales slowed down as some users went back to Android, especially Google's Pixel.Instagram User Base: Instagram has announced that its user base has increased by a 100 million over the past six months to 600 million currently. The company is expected to generate $1.5 billion in advertising revenue this year, according to research firm eMarketer.Where Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Will Have a Breakout Year in 2017;12/20/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was hit with a recent setback that's reminiscent of its choppy   ride in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, federal court   jurors in San Jose, California handed a victory to fierce CSCO   rivalArista Networks Inc(NYSE:ANET). According to a Reuters report, CSCO was seeking $335 million   in damages due to ""copyright infringementof its user interfaces.""However, jurors were not convinced that Cisco's unique user   interface technologies were developed solely as a result   of the company's creativity.Instead, Arista's attorneys successfully defended against CSCO by   deploying the ""scenes a faire"" argument.makeArticleAd();This states that, in certain circumstances, an idea cannot be   expressed unless it incorporates specific elements. These   elements then no longer have the traditional copyright protection   of exclusivity. Not surprisingly, Cisco stock absorbed a small   loss of value following the verdict.More so than the actual impact of the lawsuit is its   implications. As noted by InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli, thebiggest challenge facing Cisco stock is   competition. In the company's primary networking business, the   company faces industry giants such asJuniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) andHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE). Worse yet, the pool of potential CSCO customers   is shrinking asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) are developing their own networking solutions.As to be expected, the big boys have taken their toll   fundamentally on Cisco stock. The technology company took a   sizable blow in its hardware and router business for the most   recent quarter. Switching to other sectors hasn't always resulted   in consistent success, either. Even there, industries such as   network security are dominated by firms likePalo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) andFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT). No matter which way it goes, CSCO stock will face a tough   road.10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for       2017Cisco Stock Has the Right StuffThat said, no company is guaranteed an easy path. Even if a   business is flourishing today, competition is only right around   the corner. Since digital networking isn't exactly a proprietary   function, the next best thing for an investor is to find a   financially sturdy player. There's going to be a lot of tumbles,   as the recent verdict demonstrates, but Cisco stock is one of   those names that's built like a linebacker.This simply means that CSCO stock can take it just as much as   it can dish it. There's a lot to like in thebalance sheet- rising cash levels, controlled inventory, and investments in   physical infrastructure. That tells me that management is serious   about strategy and vision, providing confidence for long-term   holders of Cisco stock. Also, CSCO has excellent free cash   flow, so the administration aspect of the business is about as   close to worry-free as you can get.I'm especially impressed by Cisco's financial discipline.   Profitability margins continue to lead the industry, and are well   in line with historical averages. Too many times in the broader   tech sector we see organizations that are doing relatively well   today, but poorly against prior results. This is not so with   Cisco stock. Because of this discipline, shares are also   undervalued against trailing earnings.Should You Buy CSCO Stock?Based on the fundamentals, CSCO stock looks like an incredible   buy. While the networking icon is having a great 2016 - shares   are up 13% year to date - Wall Street consensus isn't quite so   enthusiastic. Yes, the majority ofcovering analysts are bullishon Cisco stock, but, there's a sizable number with ""hold""   ratings. For the fence-sitters, they view the $30 level as   technical resistance. Indeed, shares only got into trouble this   year after it breached this level.Understandably, that's no confidence boost.However, let's consider a few facts. The average price of Cisco   stock in 1999 - just before it went ballistic in the 2000 tech   bubble - was $27.77.From 2001-2007, the average price dropped to $17.49. This   year, CSCO stock has largely traded above $28. So, bear in mind   that when the issue of ""technical resistance"" comes up it's an   arbitrary comparison. The bigger picture shows that the Cisco   stock rally is serious business.I'm also loving the fact that in the current decade we have   seen three double-digit annual returns for CSCO stock, inclusive   of this year. That achievement matches what we saw in the entire   2000's decade. But, the context is even more important.10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for       2017In the past decade, those monster returns succeeded monster   losses. This time around, none of the double-digit performances   followed negative returns. In other words, this is a sustainable   rally, not a reactionary one.Now we have to set expectations straight - I doubt that Cisco   stock is going to make you rich overnight. It's an industry giant   in a competitive and saturated environment. But, this is exactly   what makes CSCO stock compelling. No one's going to play nice in   tech. If you're gonna be in a gunfight, it's best to have some   armor.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in     any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy for       201710 Losers That Will Be 2017's Best Stocks to       BuyThe postCisco Systems, Inc.

The 3 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors in 2017;12/20/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.The stock market can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming for   beginning investors. There are more than 7,000 different equities   to choose from across a variety of sectors, and each has its own   unique set of risks and catalysts.However, one of the very few constants that's held up over the   long run, and which beginning investors can take comfort in, is   thatdividend   stockstend to outperform non-dividend-paying stocks. Think about it   this way: the only companies that are usually going to share a   percentage of their profits with shareholders are those with   sound business models that have withstood the test of time, as   well as companies that expect to grow, or at least retain their   competitive advantage. In a way, dividend stocks are beacons of   success for beginning investors to follow.makeArticleAd();Of course, that isn't all. Dividends can help to hedge the   impact of the stock market's inevitable corrections, and they can   also be reinvested back into shares of more dividend-paying stock   via Dividend Reinvestment Plans, or DRIPs. This repeating pattern   of buying more stock with your dividend payout and thusly   receiving a larger dividend during the next payout is a trick the   smartest investors on Wall Street use to get rich.So where's a new investor to begin? My suggestion would be to   consider the following threebest dividend   stocksin 2017.Image source: Getty Images.Johnson & JohnsonIt's certainly not going to wow investors with double-digit   growth anymore, but healthcare conglomerateJohnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) has everything you'd look for in a top dividend stock   for a beginning investor.The most attractive component of Johnson & Johnson is its   business diversity. It's composed of more than 250 subsidiaries,   making divestments and acquisitions easier to incorporate without   disrupting the larger business, and it has three primary revenue   channels, each with its own purpose:Consumer health products is a slower-growth segment, but     J&J's brand-name health products are usually inelastic and     maintain strong pricing power. Thus, J&J's health products     segment tends to generate consistent and predictable cash     flow.Medical devices have grown slower of late, likely a result     of increasing competition in the device space. However, an     aging America that's living longer than ever is bound to need     an increasing amount of preventative care via hip, knee, and     spine procedures in the years to come, setting up J&J for     success.Pharmaceuticals are the icing on the cake for J&J as     its branded drugs provide most of its operating margin. Between     2009 and mid-2014, Johnson & Johnson brought 14 novel     medicines to market, half of which have gone on to generate $1     billion-plus in annual sales. Management believes another 10     blockbuster drugs can be brought to market (or at least have     new drug applications filed with the Food and Drug     Administration) by 2019.Johnson & Johnson is currently sitting on nearly $41   billion in cash and cash equivalents, boasts one of just two AAA   credit ratings from Standard & Poor's for all publicly traded   companies (the highest credit rating given by S&P), and has a   54-year streak of increasing its payout, putting it among truly   elite company. J&J's 2.8% yield is nicely above the average   yield for theS&P 500, making it one of the best dividend stocks, and least volatile   investments, for beginning investors.Image source: Pixabay.NextEra EnergyAnother great dividend stock for beginning investors to   consider isNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) in the utility sector.Electric utility stocks are often a great place to start for   both income-seeking investors and beginning investors because   they deal with an inelastic product: electricity. If you own a   home, rent an apartment, or run a business, you need electricity.   With the exception of being unable to control Mother Nature,   electricity usage and regulatory price increases make cash flow   and profitability somewhat predictable -- and trust me, Wall   Street and investors love when there aren't any surprises.However, NextEra Energy doesn't have too much in common with   your standard utility company. Whereas most electric utilities   have only begun to recognize the benefits of alternative   energies, NextEra has been embracing them for more than a decade.   NextEra Energy and its affiliates are the largest provider of   renewable energy from the wind and sun in the world. Not to   mention it also is one of the largest operators of commercial   nuclear power with the capacity to generate more than 6.4 GW of   emissions-free electricity, which is enough to power almost 5   million households.NextEra Energy's focus on going green is critical for a number   of reasons. To begin with, though the expense of focusing on   renewable energy is costly upfront, NextEra's   electricity-generating costs are probably going to be a lot lower   five or 10 years from now than nearly all of its peers which   could be scrambling to install wind and solar platforms.   Secondly, it puts NextEra ahead of the curve when it comes to   reducing its carbon emissions. Should the U.S. Environmental   Protection Agency choose to tighten emissions regulations in the   years or decades to come, NextEra will be prepared. Lastly, its   high usage of wind and solar means lower long-term costs for the   consumer, which probably means a happier customer.NextEra likely has the potential to grow its profits by   between 5% and 9% annually through the end of the decade, which,   when combined with its 2.9% dividend yield, could make it one of   the best dividend stocks for beginning investors to own.Image source: Getty Images.Cisco SystemsOne of the best dividend stocks beginning investors can   consider buying from the technology sector is networking giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) .Like all stocks, Cisco Systems has its imperfections.   Innovation within the technology space moves rapidly, and from   time to time Cisco has had to ramp up its spending to seemingly   catch up with the next innovative wave. We're beginning to see   Cisco's investments really pay off. For instance, in August Cisco   announced that it was going to eliminate 5,500 jobs in its   traditional switching and router division, which it primarily   supplies to enterprise customers and telecom carriers, and it   invest the ""savings"" into faster-growing software segments, such   as security, cloud-computing, and the Internet of Things, all of   which have long-term double-digit growth potential. During the   first quarter of fiscal 2017, security revenue wound up   increasing 11% year over year.However, investors don't have to throw Cisco's legacy   businesses out with the bathwater just yet. Even though it's   making the move into software, it's still a dominant player in   networking equipment (switching and routing), which is nothing to   sneeze at. Asnoted by my Foolish colleague Tim Green, Cisco had north of 60% market share in the switching market,   according to IDC, in 2015. Comparatively, there aren't any other   manufacturers above 9% market share, leaving Cisco as the   brand-name hardware company in the networking space. And it's   still healthfully profitable on these products.But if there's one thing Cisco's dominance brings to the table   every year, it's lots of free cash flow. Earlier this year Cisco   announced a $15 billion share buyback and once again increased   its dividend (by 24% this go-around). Currently yielding 3.4%,   Cisco is in prime position to benefit income-seeking investors   and those beginning investors who are terrified of risk and want   to own brand-name companies.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Should You Buy Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) in 2017?;12/19/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsFor a boring company,Cisco Systems Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) generates a lot of heat among analysts.Over half its analysts currently rate the stocka buy, but JPMorgan says CSCO is ina ""tough spot,""amid below-average growth and rising interest rates.makeArticleAd();Which side is right? Well, both, actually.Like some other tech companies, such asInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), Cisco has been executing a turn this decade from being a   growth stock to a yield play. It initiated a dividend in 2011 at   six cents per share, but that's now up to 26 cents, yielding   3.4%.CSCO shares, while up 71% over the past five years, trail   the 85% gain in the S&P 500 during that period. Buying Cisco   for growth, in short, has become a bad play, but those who bought   it for yield have done well.7 Big Tech Stocks to Buy for Dow 20,000The Open ThreatLikeOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL), which has been disappointing the Street in recent earnings   announcements, Cisco faces a threat from open source. In its   case, the threat comes in the form of the Open Compute Project   (OCP), originally launched byFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) to reduce the cost of building cloud data centers. Hardware is   becoming software, and even specialized pieces of hardware, like   switches, are becoming virtual.Whenever CEO Chuck Robbins addresses the media or analysts, he   is asked about the OCP, and his answer is always the same. It's a   threat on the low end, not on the high end;it's not an either-or but both.While that answer is accurate, it underestimates the long-term   threat. Virtualization is making all sorts of hardware into   software. Custom chips and proprietary software may be necessary   in some markets, but the industry's mega-trend is keeping switch   margins down, even while formal competition is reduced, and that   is not changing.Cisco is slowly losing its niche.Seeking New MarketsAware of the threat, Cisco is seekingleadership in new markets.Since 2012, Cisco has made dozens ofacquisitions in computer securityto develop its ""Security Everywhere"" strategy. Most, likeCloudLock, bought in June, focus on the cloud, where Cisco needs to shore   up margins against the OCP threat, giving switching customers   something to buy while it still has them. Its revenue from   security isrising at double-digit rates, even while total revenue remains stable.Cisco has been continuously developing an Internet of Things   strategy, spending $1.4 billion earlier this year onJasper Technologiesfor its cloud-based IoT platform. Over time, monitoring products   and components will become bigger Internet markets than people,   and this is supposed to keep Cisco growing beyond next year.The problem is that other mainline companies such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing the same thing, and older cybersecurity firms such   asSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) are also going""up the stack""with acquisitions aimed at the cloud and other complex   systems.While Cisco's high-end switches were unique early in this   century, briefly making CSCO the most valuable company in the   world, the world has since changed. Cisco's strategy of building   secure collaboration with subscription-based software   revenueis not unique, and it will have to undergo largelayoffsto keep margins up in its core business.10 ""Best of the Best"" Stocks to Buy for       2017The Bottom LineCisco is neither going to collapse nor break out in 2017. Its   yield is going to look smaller as interest rates rise. While the   dividend remains affordable, usually covered more than twice over   by earnings, and a lower stock price would automatically raise   that yield, that's not much of an argument to buy   CSCO stock.Having Cisco in your portfolio won't burn you, but the company   will not burn up the track, either. If you're looking to   speculate, look elsewhere. If you're looking for yield, buy on a   dip.Dana     Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Cisco Systems;12/19/2016;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the October 2017 expiration for CSCO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $25 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 81 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.2% return against the $25 commitment, or a 3.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSCO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 18.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $24.19 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 81 cents from $25), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.9% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.9% figure actually exceeds the 3.4% annualized dividend paid by Cisco Systems, Inc., based on the current share price of $30.77. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 18.75% to reach the $25 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for CSCO below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.4% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the October 2017 expiration, for shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $32 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.47 bid, annualizes to an additional 5.7% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 9.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $32 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CSCO shares would have to climb 4% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 8.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Cisco Systems, Inc., highlighting in green where the $25 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $32 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the October 2017 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cisco Systems, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading dayCSCO historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $30.77) to be 22%.Top YieldBoost CSCO Calls »"

What Is The Cloud And How Are Companies Making Money With It?;12/19/2016;"In recent years, the “cloud” has emerged as one of the major focus area for technology giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and IBM among other players.“By 2020, a corporate ""no-cloud"" policy will be as rare as a ""no-internet"" policy is today,”accordingto Gartner.Cloud can simply be thought of as the Internet. With cloud, instead of maintaining on-premises data centers with computer hardware and software, companies can access all systems on the cloud platform of the service provider.makeArticleAd();“Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” asexplainedby the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) are the three offerings which can either be on a public, private or hybrid cloud.While cloud computing services have been offered for more than a decade, companies were initially skeptical about such offerings amid concerns of sharing sensitive records and security of company’s data.However, with its advantages such as flexibility, cutting of capital expenditure, easy anytime-anywhere access, disaster recovery, no fear of lost devices and opportunity for smaller enterprises to use infrastructure which cannot be afforded in-house, all started to attract enterprises to the cloud.It isestimatedthat, “The savings created by a flexible infrastructure can be substantial, between 25% and 50% in federal agencies studied by the Brookings Institute.”Gartnerestimatesthat, “the IT spending is steadily shifting from traditional IT offerings to cloud services (cloud shift). The aggregate amount of cloud shift in 2016 is estimated to reach $111 billion, increasing to $216 billion in 2020.” It is further estimated that “more than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years.”Companies And The CloudAmazon(AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the undisputed market leader in cloud computing. Itdominatedthe worldwide public IaaS with a 45% market share while it held about 35% of public PaaS during Q3 FY 2016. It generated $3.2 billion in revenue for AWS during Q3 FY 2016.Microsoft(MSFT) has been highly focused on the cloud since Satya Nadella took over the reins at Microsoft. The company plans to realize $20 billion as commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate by 2018; the same was reported at $12.1 billion during FY 2016.Cloud is an important component ofIBM's(IBM) “strategic imperatives.” DuringQ3 2016, IBM’s cloud revenue (public, private and hybrid) increased 44% to $3.4 billion while its cloud revenue over the trailing 12 months was $12.7 billion.Google(GOOG,GOOGL) ranks among the top five cloud players with a worldwide market share of 4%according to SG Research. In November 2015, Urs Hölzle, Senior Vice President for Technical Infrastructure at Googlesaid, “My goal is for us to talk about Google as a cloud company in 2020 because our revenue is bigger than the ads revenue and it’s a realistic possibility.”Salesforce(CRM) is featured among themost innovative companiesin the world and earns majority of its revenue from cloud computing. It offers cloud services with a focus on CRM – Customer Relationship Management. While Salesforce is a top CRM vendor accounting for 20% market share, its cloud services make up 4% of the overall market share.Adobe(ADBE) Creative Cloud offers innovative tools and services for creating digital media, data-driven marketing and more. During the recentlyreleasedearnings executive vice president and chief financial officer Mark Garrettsaid, “We are uniquely positioned as a cloud provider to deliver both top line and bottom line growth.” Adobe marketing cloud achieved $1.63 billion in annual revenue, 20% year-on-year growth.Oracle(ORCL) offers cloud services across all three service models i.e. SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. As per its earningsreport, “Oracle is the number one player in SaaS cloud applications sales to customers with over 1,000 employees.” During Q2 FY 2017, its total cloud revenue increased 62% to touch $1.1 billion in revenue.Alibaba(BABA) considers cloud computing as its future growth areas. Although its revenue from cloud remains small in absolute terms, it increased 130% year-on-year to $224 million duringQ2 FY 2016.Other companies such as SAP, Rackspace, NTT Communications, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), workday, VMware (VMW), CISCO (CSCO) are also a part of the competitive cloud computing conglomerate .Companies, both big and small have been investing heavily to acquire or establish data centers to cater to the growing demand for cloud in the coming times.In September, IBM opened its 48th global cloud data center. In October, Microsoftannouncedthat it has more than doubled its cloud capacity in Europe in the past year, taking its investments in Europe over $3 billion to date. While during the recent earnings call, Sundar Pichai, CEO, Googlesaid, ""And as we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth.”Alibaba is not far behind, the company hasannouncedfour new data centers -- located in Japan, Germany, the Middle East and Australia, which will bring Alibaba Cloud’s worldwide total to 14.Final WordThere lies immense scope for growth in cloud computing with adoption levels remain low. As per Google’s officialblog, “In fact, only a tiny fraction of the world’s data is currently in the cloud – most businesses and applications aren’t cloud-based yet.” To combat the stiff completion and global increase in demand in times ahead, cloud computing providers are gearing by working on innovative solutions driven by machine learning and artificial intelligence, and enhanced security system on the cloud."

Broadcom Ships World's First 16 nm Knowledge-Based Chips;12/19/2016;"Shares ofBroadcom LimitedAVGOhave underperformed the broader Zacks Electronics- Semiconductors industry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry generated a return of 49.7%, the stock returned 22.9%.The underperformance of the stock could be attributed to a highly competitive environment, along with aggressive price wars, which persistently force the company to reduce prices or increase marketing expenditures. Average selling prices of established products also tend to erode in the semiconductor industry, and Broadcom has to continuously invest in R&D, in order to introduce value-added products that provide a hedge against competition. These, in turn, limit its profitability to a certain extent.However, Broadcom is expected to enjoy synergistic benefits from the merger with Avago, which will boost its profitability. In addition, the company maintains an efficient global supply chain with a variable, low-cost operating model, enabling it to maintain sustainable revenue growth and expand margins. Meanwhile, the company has recently flagged off the shipments of BCM15000 (BCM15K) - its latest line of 16 nm heterogeneous knowledge-based processors (KBPs) - that have been designed keeping in mind the modern network infrastructure, including core, edge, switches and routers, for the data centers.What is Special About BCM15K?The new line of BCM15K 16nm KBPs are capable of integrating SRAM, TCAM and algorithmic search technology, in order to deliver the highest throughput and performance, capable of handling hyperscale data center applications, network security appliances. These are optimized for the next generation of service provider networks.The BCM15K KBPs can deliver internet search speeds of up to 7.2 billion searches per second. These are capable of transferring data at a whopping speed of 1 terabit per second, which is an impressive improvement over the older KBPs.What Does This Mean for Broadcom?Given the fast proliferation of bandwidth-intense applications, like video streaming and cloud computing, global internet traffic is estimated to shoot through the roof in the coming years. As per a CiscoCSCOreport, by the end of this year, global IP traffic is anticipated to cross the threshold level of 1 zettabyte. Moreover, by 2020, a phenomenal 2.3 zettabytes of IP traffic is estimated to become the standard.Hence, the requirement for advanced routers and switches having high performance KBPs, capable of handling such huge amounts of data, is likely to witness strong demand, going ahead.We note that the 16 nm KBPs are the world's first to provide Broadcom an advantage over its peers and augur well for the company over the long run.BROADCOM LTD PriceBROADCOM LTD Price|BROADCOM LTD QuoteZacks Rank and Key PicksAt present, Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other favorably placed stocks in the broader technology space are Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.AAOIand Cirrus Logic, Inc.CRUS, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Boeing, GE Raise Dividends; ExxonMobil Gets New CEO";12/16/2016;"The Dow enjoyed a week of strong gains on rising expectations about the likely industry friendly policies of the Trump administration. Economic data released this week continued to be largely positive in nature. Meanwhile, the Fed raised rates for the first time this year. Though the move was initially met with apprehension by investors, markets slowly warmed to the move. Oil prices continued to be volatile in nature.Last Week's PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.7% after recently beaten down sectors staged an impressive rebound. Gains in sectors like consumer staples and healthcare helped the blue-chip index finish at a record high. Expectations that Donald Trump will adopt new policies including expansionary infrastructure spending, financial deregulation and tax cuts continued to have a positive impact on broader markets.Moreover, shares of Coca-Cola CompanyKOincreased 2.5% after announcing that its CEO Muhtar Kent, will be stepping down after 8 years. He'll be replaced by Coca-Cola's current President, 51-year-old James Quincey.The index posted its fifth straight weeks of gains, increasing by 3.1%. Most of last week's gains came on the back of Trump induced rally and encouraging domestic economic data. Expectations over Trump's economic policies continued to boost markets, while strong service data helped investors offset Italian referendum concerns. Also, investor sentiment bolstered after ECB's announcement about trimming bond-buying volume.The DowThisWeekThe index increased 0.2% ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting's commencement. The Dow extended its winning streak into the sixth straight session even as other benchmarks declined. Investors refrained from making big bets ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting. Both the financial and technology sector, which had registered strong gains over the last few weeks, plunged.During the weekend, some of the key non-OPEC members including Russia decided to reduce their crude production by 558,000 barrels per day. This boostedoil pricesto their highest levels since July 2015.The index increased 0.6% on Tuesday, hitting an all-time record for the seventh straight session. Trump induced rally continued to have a broad-based positive impact on key indexes with the blue-chip index closing less than 100 points short of the desired psychological level of 20,000. At that point, the index had increased 13.6% year-to-date and more than 8% since the results of the presidential election were announced.The index lost 0.6% on Wednesday after the Fed signaled that rates will be increased at a quicker pace next year when the economy is strong enough to sustain it. The Fed now expects three rate increases next year, one higher than the number of rate hikes projected in its September meeting.Separately, oil prices fell on crude oversupply concerns and stronger dollar. The EIA reported that crude stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma increased to its highest level in last six months last week. An increase in interest rates strengthened the dollar which also weighed on oil prices.The index increased 0.3% on Wednesday as the Trump induced rally continued to have a broad-based positive impact on key indexes. Also, investors reassessed Fed's decision to raise key interest rates at a faster pace next year and welcomed a slew of encouraging economic data.CPI rose 0.2% in November. Moreover, CPI rose 1.7% over the past twelve months, its best gain since Oct 2014. Separately, the NY Empire State Index came in at 9 in December, significantly higher than last month's reading of 1.5.ComponentsMovingthe IndexThe Boeing Co.BAhas boosted its quarterly dividend by 30% and authorized a new stock repurchase plan of $14 billion, which replaces the existing share buyback program. Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Boeing will now pay a quarterly dividend of $1.42 per share, up from $1.09 paid earlier, bringing the annual dividend yield to 3.6% from the prior level of 2.8%.This means that each Boeing shareholder will now gain an extra 13.6-18.3% on each common share of the company.

Stay Far, Far Away From Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock in 2017;12/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up 12% year-to-date, after an even more impressive   2015 when AMZN stock more than doubled. Amazon hit its 52-week   high at $847 on Oct. 6, but tumbled after disappointing on   earnings later that month.Source:Atomic Taco Via FlickrmakeArticleAd();After the election of Donald Trump, who had engaged in a war   of words with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, AMZN stock fell further,   closing at $719.07 on Nov. 14.Trump accused Amazon ofviolating antitrust lawand suggested that Jeff Bezos was using theWashington Postforpolitical influenceand tax shelter. Trump warned that Amazon and Bezos are ""going to   have such problems""  once he is elected.For his part, Bezos announced his dream ofsending Trump to outer space.  Since then, Amazon stock has rebounded to around $760   right now, as Trump appeared to have softened on Amazon, holding   asummit with top tech CEOson Wednesday.The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy for 2017Some see the decline in Amazon stock as a temporary pause andbuying opportunity. About that …Don't Buy AMZN Stock!Stocks generally perform better when the market's expectations   are low. If expectations are high, so is the risk of   disappointment. Bye-bye valuation. If the market expects little,   the chance of surprising on the upside is higher.The media and analysts fawn over Amazon stock. With a mean   analyst rating of 1.9 on Yahoo Finance (representing a ""buy""),   opinion seems split between those who view Amazon stock as a   ""buy"" and those who view it as a ""strong buy."" Themean analyst targetfor Amazon stock is $929, implying a 23% upside.When a the market overvalues stocks and expectations are   high, we will see cases of irrational exuberance in the media.   People will write books titledDow 36,000and talk about certain tech companies hitting$1 trillion in market cap(in this case,Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) in 2000, which didpass $500 billionbefore the tech bubble burst).We are seeing such optimism with Amazon now. Ark Invest   CEOCatherine Woodand RBC Capital managing directorMark Mahaneymade such predictions this year. These bullish estimates   still fall short of venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya 's   forecast of Amazon asa $3 trillion company.WhenAmazon Web Services first launchedexpectations were low, and AWS pleasantly surprised analysts.   Amazon would get laughed out of the room. Now, the public feels   that Amazon will conquer the world.Amazon trades at 176 times earnings, and its valuation looks   frothy on other measures as well. Even relative to Amazon's past   experience. The price-book ratio stands at 20.5, above the   13-year median of 14.96 . The price-sales ratio, at 2.85 hovers   above the median of 2.02, and is not too far off the 13-year high   of 3.16 .Bulls might retort that the market has overvalued Amazon stock   for the past 15 years, during which it still managed to soar from   $6 in August 2001 to $840. At any rate, further margin expansion   seems improbable, especially since Amazon is now a $360 billion   company.Investors Will Rediscover ValueHistorically, value stocks generallyoutperform growth stocks. During times of lackluster growth in the real economy, growth   stocks such as Amazon tend to do well. During times of fast   growth,value stocksperform better.This trend reversed in the aftermath of the 2009 recession.   Growth returned, yet value stocks continued to underperform. The   gap between the performance of the market and of value stockswidened since 2007. This may be due to low interest rates reducing the cost of   borrowing.And investors lost their patients with most stocks, where   management plugged profits into buying back shares rather than   investing in future growth. Investors were willing to pay a   premium for growth, since companies that were actually investing   in growth could not be easily found.However,stock buybacks have decreasedin 2016. This should erode the growth premium commanded by stocks   such as Amazon. With high corporate profits and stock prices   relatively overvalued, interest should further shift to value   stocks.Bottom Line on AMZN StockInstead of buying Amazon and paying a premium, investors   should look for conservatively valued stocks. Stocks such as   Cisco andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) will benefit from investors rediscovering value stocks.Cisco trades at 14.5 times earnings, 12 times forward earnings   and 2.4 times book value. Cisco holds $14.12 of cash per share, a   whopping 46.3% of its market capitalization. This suggests that   the market expects little from Cisco, giving it a higher chance   of surprising on the upside.Readers' Choice: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Will       Be 2017's Best StockTech stocks like Cisco also welcome a rise in interest rates   since it will increase interest payments on their cash. So hold   off on buying growth stocks at stretched valuations like   AMZN stock.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of     the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace4 BlackRock ETFs to Buy for Steady Retirement       IncomeThe 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for       2017The postStay Far, Far Away From Amazon.com, Inc.

Cisco Receives Adverse Ruling Against Arista in California;12/16/2016;"Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOrecently received an adverse ruling in a copyright infringement lawsuit against close rival Arista NetworksANET. The jurors at the federal court in San Jose, CA ruled that Arista did not commit any notable infringement on any Cisco patent and consequently, would not pay any damages.makeArticleAd();Per Reuters ""The jury found that Arista infringed some of Cisco's copyrights. However, jurors also said Arista proved that external factors, other than Cisco's creativity, dictated the design of Cisco's content.""Cisco plans to appeal the jury ruling. The company had been seeking nearly $335 million in damages over patent infringement of its command-line interfaces. The lawsuit is one of the two cases the company filed in 2014 that accuses Arista of infringing 14 patents.The ruling is particularly shocking for Cisco given the fact that it recently won a patent ruling against Arista at the U.S International Trade Commission (ITC). The ITC judge found Arista guilty of infringing Cisco's two patents. The ruling is scheduled for a review over the next few months by the ITC. If found guilty, ITC has the authority to place a ban on import of Arista's products in the U.S.CISCO SYSTEMS Price and ConsensusCISCO SYSTEMS Price and Consensus|CISCO SYSTEMS QuoteCisco-Arista Rivalry IntensifiesThe rivalry between Cisco and Arista has intensified in recent years. Although Cisco holds more than 50% of the market share in the switching business, Arista's meteoric rise has affected its top-line growth and profitability.Arista was founded in 2004 by two former Cisco executives. Per Reuter's data, the company's annual revenue jumped 43% since its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2014 to $837 million at the end of 2015. Over the same period, Cisco's total revenue increased 4.3% to $49.25 billion.Notably, Cisco's switching revenues increased 5.3% in fiscal 2015, but remained almost flat in fiscal 2016. Apart from Arista, the company's switching business faces significant competition from the likes of Huawei, Hewlett Packard EnterpriseHPEand Juniper NetworksJNPR.Stock Price OverviewShares of Cisco have underperformed the broader ZacksComputer Networksindustry on a six-month basis. While the stock has returned 5.8%, while the industry gained 6.5%.The underperformance could be attributed to intensifying competition from several smaller players, slowing order growth from service providers and challenges in the emerging markets.Notably, in the trailing six-month period, Arista, Juniper and Hewlett Packard shares have gained 34.4%, 23.2% and 25.3%, respectively.Zacks Rank & Key PickCisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Nokia to Acquire Deepfield to Strengthen IP Network Security;12/16/2016;"Nokia Corp.NOKhas entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Deepfield, a specialist in real-time analytics for IP network performance management and security. The deal is likely to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approval. However, the financial terms of the deal has not been closed yet.The acquisition of Deepfield will significantly enhance Nokia's analytics-driven network and service automation capabilities. Deepfield's most valued product is its Internet Genome technology, which can identify over 30,000 popular cloud applications and services, along with tracking traffic runs to and through networks to reach subscribers, in real time. Nokia aims to integrate Deepfield's big data analytics capabilities with its dynamic control capabilities of open software defined network platforms.Nokia's network infrastructure is primarily centred on telecom operators. Consequently, Nokia Networks acquisition of its rival company Alcatel-Lucent for $17.4 billion last year has transformed it into a formidable player in the global telecom infrastructure market.The buyout of the wireless business of Alcatel-Lucent has significantly strengthened Nokia's foothold in North America.  Leading U.S. telecom operators, namely, AT&T Inc.Tand Verizon Communications Inc.VZare prominent customers of Alcatel-Lucent. Additionally, Alcatel-Lucent has a strong presence in China while Nokia enjoys considerable dominance in Europe and Asia.Importantly, Alcatel-Lucent has lucrative assets to support the enterprise segment, which Nokia intends to capitalize on to get a strong foothold in the sector already dominated by large network infrastructure solution providers like Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOand Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.The merged entity can effectively capitalize on the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform and offer competent triple-play voice, video and data solutions worldwide. The core focus areas will be next-generation 5G wireless technology, IP and software defined networking, cloud-based solutions, big data analytics, and sensors and imaging.Price Performance of NokiaSo far, 2016 has turned out to be a pathetic one for Nokia. Year to date, the stock price of the company plunged a substantial 32.76% underperforming the Zacks categorizedWireless Equipment industry, which has witnessed a decline of 6.30% in the same time frame.Nevertheless, Nokia is restructuring its wireless infrastructure gear making wings to capitalize on upcoming 5G network, IoT and lucrative enterprise solutions business.

(CSCO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;12/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) has been a flop as a long-term investment. For the past decade, the return has been an awful 11%. But lately, the CSCO stock price has been getting some mojo. In fact, the return for this year is the same as for the past 10 years!Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Note that the company's CEO, Chuck Robbins, came on board in the summer of 2015 and has not wasted much time in making some big changes, such as with divesting non-core assets and investing more aggressively in growth markets like cloud computing and mobile. All in all, there are signs that these moves are gaining traction.makeArticleAd();The competitive environment remains intense, however, and Cisco stock is feeling the pressure on the company's main networking business. It's not exactly easy to make the transition from hardware to software.That means Cisco stock could be a value or a risk right now. To see, here's a look at the pros and cons:Cisco Stock ProsTransformation: A key part of the growth strategy has been aggressive buying. It helps that the company has a long history of dealmaking. In other words, the company knows how to spot opportunities as well as integrate diverse cultures. There are also the critical advantages of Cisco's global customer base, strong sales organization and trusted brand, especially when dealing with mission-critical technologies.The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017Yet this does not imply that the core networking business will somehow not be an important driver. If anything, the long-term prospects still look bright. According to Cisco's research, the amount of mobile traffic is forecasted to surge byeight times from 2015 to 2020, representing a 53% compound annual growth rate. Some of the factors include mega-trends like streaming video, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the Internet of Things.Although, Cisco has been adapting to the swift changes in the market. To this end, the company is focusing more on software-based approaches and also subscription business models.Strong Financials: CSCO continues to show discipline with its costs. During the summer, the company announced a7% reductionin the workforce, translating into about 5,500 jobs. So yes, CSCO has continued to be a nice cash generator. For the latestquarter, operating cash flows came to $2.7 billion. In all, there is $71 billion in the bank. Something about this: $61 billion of that amount is in foreign accounts. That is, if Donald Trump passes legislation for lower taxes to repatriate capital - which seems like a pretty good bet - this will certainly be good news for holders of Cisco stock. The company will be able to use the resources for acquisitions, share buybacks and higher dividend payouts.Valuation: Cisco stock looks like a good value. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12. Oh, and when subtracting out the cash, the multiple is a mere 6. By comparison, the forward P/E ratio forMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is 19 andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) sports a multiple of 14 times earnings. Finally, CSCO has a decent dividend yield of 3.4%.Cisco Stock ConsCompetition: Cisco must fight tough rivals in various markets. In the security space alone, there are standout operators likePalo Alto NetworksInc(NYSE:PANW) andFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT). But perhaps the biggest competitive threat is to the core networking business. There are the long-time U.S. companies, such asJuniper Networks, Inc.(NYSE:JNPR) andHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE), as well as next-gen firms likeArista Networks Inc(NYSE:ANET). At the same time, CSCO must fight againstHuaweiand other low-cost Chinese firms.Yet there is another important factor: Cisco's potential customers becoming competitors! To lower costs and improve performance, mega tech companies likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) have been building their own networking technologies.Lumpiness of Revenues:Cisco sells to many large enterprise customers across the world. While this means that purchase orders are generally large and have long terms, there is always the risk of deals falling through or being delayed. Actually, if there are even minor snags, the impact on revenues can be significant. Interestingly enough, this happened during the latestquarter. The company gave a tepid outlook, with a forecast of revenues expected to fall by 2% to 4% in the current quarter. CSCO indicated that, yes, large network service provider customers have been pulling back on orders.Growth: For a company at the scale of CSCO, it is natural for the top line to be fairly moderate. The problem is that - for some time - the growth path has been meager. As noted above, a key factor is that the core networking business is under pressure from the competition. During the latestquarter, the revenues from switching hardware fell 7% and there was a 6% drop in the router segment. But even in the more promising categories there are troublesome issues. In the latest quarter, the cloud-based collaboration business suffered a 3% decline in revenues and even the wireless gear segment was off by 5%.Then again, CSCO management may be having difficulties in managing the complexities of diverse businesses. In other words, it may make sense for the company to think about focusing on a smaller number of operations.Bottom Line on Cisco StockAgain, Cisco faces some tough challenges. But it is important to keep in mind that turnarounds take time. As Robbins noted in theQ1 report: ""You have to look at it over time, and not just quarter to quarter.""Besides, Cisco is betting on the right markets, such as cloud computing and mobile. In fact, there are already indications that the security segment could be a key driver. In the latest quarter, revenues jumped by 11%. Then again, CSCO has been smart to build security features into its networking systems.Why Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Will Win Big With     WaymoFinally, the valuation on Cisco stock is attractive and so is the dividend - and cash flows should remain substantial.So for investors looking for a stable play in the tech sector, the pros outweigh the cons.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you   canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Nokia (NOK) Expands 4.5G Network Infrastructure Portfolio;12/14/2016;"makeZacksArticleAd();Nokia Networks, a division ofNokia Corp.NOKrecently declared that it has signed contract agreements to install 4.5G wireless network infrastructure with 110 wireless carriers globally. The capabilities Nokia is rolling out under the 4.5G and 4.5G Pro labels map to the LTE-Advanced Pro standard that was included in the 3GPP's Release 13 earlier this year. Nokia Networks acquisition of its rival company Alcatel-Lucent for $17.4 billion last year has transformed it into a formidable player in the global telecom infrastructure market.Nokia's network infrastructure is primarily centred on telecom operators. The buyout of the wireless business of Alcatel-Lucent has significantly strengthened Nokia's foothold in North America. Leading U.S. telecom operators, namely Verizon Communications Inc.VZand AT&T Inc.Tare prominent customers of Alcatel-Lucent. Additionally, Alcatel-Lucent has a strong presence in China, while Nokia enjoys considerable dominance in Europe and Asia.Importantly, Alcatel-Lucent has lucrative assets to support the enterprise segment, which Nokia intends to capitalize on, to get a strong foothold in the sector already dominated by large network infrastructure solution providers like Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOand Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.The merged entity can effectively capitalize on the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform and offer competent triple-play voice, video and data solutions worldwide. The core focus areas will be next-generation 5G wireless technology, IP and software, defined networking, cloud-based solutions, big data analytics, and sensors and imaging.The takeover of Alcatel-Lucent by Nokia has created a network solutions behemoth in the industry with a significant global customer base and solid operational efficiencies. Nokia boasts strong technical expertise in professional managed services and customer experience management apart from a rich portfolio of mobile broadband infrastructure and 4G LTE network. On the other hand, Alcatel-Lucent enjoys relative advantage in IP-based products, optical networking, cloud computing/software-defined networking, fixed broadband network and professional services.Price Performance of NokiaSo far, 2016 has turned out to be a pathetic one for Nokia. Year to date, the stock price of the company plunged a substantial 34.05%, underperforming the Zacks categorized Wireless Equipment industry that declined 6.13% in the same time frame. However, Nokia is restructuring its wireless infrastructure gear making wings to capitalize on upcoming 5G network, IoT and lucrative enterprise solutions business.

Tech and Trump: Can They Find Common Ground in New York?;12/13/2016;"Tomorrow, all eyes will be on New York City's Trump Tower as President-Elect Donald Trump sits down with Silicon Valley's top tech leaders. While the meeting's agenda has yet to be disclosed, it is safe to assume themes like job creation, immigration, regulation, and encryption will all be likely discussion topics.It's been well documented that the vast majority of Silicon Valley leaders opposed Trump during the presidential election, with some helping and fund-raising for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during her campaign. The Obama administration has acted largely favorable towards large tech corporations over the years, from its ""net-neutrality"" policy-which requires internet providers to treat all web traffic equally-to its hands-off tactics to the tech industry's growing concentration of power.Joining Trump on his side of the table will be Reince Preibus, his chief of staff, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and key transition team member Peter Thiel, a tech investor who was one of the few Silicon Valley names to support Mr. Trump.Expected tech executives include:AppleAAPLChief Executive Tim CookFacebookFBChief Operating Officer andLean Inauthor Sheryl SandbergMicrosoftMSFTCEO Satya NadellaAmazonAMZNCEO andThe Washington Postowner Jeff BezosTesla MotorsTSLACEO Elon MuskAlphabetGOOGLCEO and Chairman Larry Page and Eric SchmidtIntelINTCCEO Brian KrzanichIBMIBMCEO Ginni RomettyOracleORCLco-CEO Safra CatzCiscoCSCOCEO Chuck RobbinsSurprisingly, TwitterTWTRCEO Jack Dorsey will not be present at the meeting, given how much Mr. Trump prefers the social networking platform over others.Many of these tech companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, saw theirshares slidethe day after the election on worries that a Trump presidency would negatively affect their manufacturing and product distribution methods here in the U.S. and especially abroad.One area of common ground, however, could be tax reform. According to theWall Street Journal, the president-elect is ""expected to promote corporate tax reform, which, depending on the details, could enable U.S. tech companies to bring home hundreds of billions of dollars they currently hold offshore.""The meeting is set for 2:00pm on Wednesday afternoon, and the world will be watching, waiting to learn all the minute details, hoping for, at least, some agreement on key issues, and realizing that the tech industry and Mr. Trump may need more from each other than either is willing to give.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;12/13/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) stock went public this year at $15 on the New York Stock   Exchange on June 23, andsurged 92%on the first day of trading, closing at $28.79 a share. Twilio   stock went as high as $70 in late September before gravity set in   and brought it down to $29 a share.Source:Web Summit Via FlickrmakeArticleAd();You may not have heard of Twilio before.Twilioenables software developers to program voice and text   messaging.When you install WhatsApp orFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) Messenger on your phone, you will get a text with an   authorization code, and this is powered by Twilio. This promises   great value for businesses, helping them stay in contact with   customers in the digital age.Twilio Stock ProsRapid Growth:Those who buy TWLO stock will buy into a fast-growing business.   Twilio is growing customer accounts and revenues at a fast pace.   As of Sept. 30, 2015, Twilio had23,822 accounts. A  year later, TWLO's accounts grew to 34,457, a 44.6%   increase. Twilio grew revenue even faster, at a 75% rate, which   suggests that it's growing its revenue per user.  Growth   should remain steady as the company branches out intoenterpriseservices.High-Gross Margin:Twilio is not profitable as of yet, but it should be in the   future. Twilio's enjoys a high gross margin at 55.6%, which   indicates adurable competitive advantage. Also, while Twilio has not yet managed a profit, the operating   cash flow is positive, with $4.4 million net cash from   operations.The 10 Biggest Stock Market Failures of       2016This indicates that the underlying business is sound.    Twilio is establishing itself as a premium brand with cloud   communications, with a simple and easy to use platform giving   customers global reach. Twilio's support matters for apps such asUber,freeing them up to concentrate on core services. TWLO adds value   to customers, and this could translate into higher margins in the   future.Spread of Cloud Communications:Twilio should benefit from some tailwinds as cloud-based   communication becomes adopted.Appslike Uber need totext their usersfor things such as authentication or notifying them that their   car is ready. The development of apps will increase the need for   services provided by a company like Twilio.Twilio will also benefit as businesses keep in contact with   their customers via their smartphones. Retailers will want to use   text messages to alert their customers to special sales or   promotions. Instead of calling helplines and dealing with   annoying phone trees, millennialsprefer to interact with businesses via text.Twilio Stock ConsCompetition-Real and Potential:Twilio faces a long list ofcompetitors, includingCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO)Tropo, Sinch, Plivo, CallFire,Vonage Holdings Corp.(NYSE:VG) Nexmo, thinQ and Bandwidth.com. Twilio's competitors, such as   Plivo, Sinch, and Nexmo, generallycharge lessfor their services.Also, telecom companies could compete with TWLO by offering   their own cloud API services.AT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) has offered developers anAPI platformsince 2012. Telecom companies will facecost and pricing pressuresin the years to come, and might move toward this. These network   providers, currently are suppliers to Twilio, providing phone   numbers and sending text messages and calls. Things might get   difficult if they decided to compete with Twilio.Tech giantswith deep pockets and huge platforms such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook might decide to compete with Twilio as well.   Facebook Messenger appears to be moving towardbusiness communications, which could threaten TWLO. Amazon began offeringpush notificationsin 2013, a move toward communications.Valuation:Twilio stock's high valuation bakes in a great deal of growth,   and buying TWLO now carries a lot of downside risk. Currently,   Twilio stock trades at 11 times sales and 9 times book value   while operating at a loss. This means that the market has high   expectations for TWLO stock. If Mr. Market is disappointed, those   who buy TWLO stock will suffer.Buying Twilio stock at such expensive prices is a risky   proposition. A s richly valued as Twilio stock may be, however,   it was trading at an even higher multiple of sales in October.   Twilio stock reached its 52-week high at $70.96 on Sept. 28. That   represented a multiple of nearly 25 times sales, a stratospheric   valuation.Lock-Up Period Expiring:When Twilio listed in June, insiders and major shareholders   agreed to a lock-up period during which they would not sell their   shares. This lock-up period will expire onDec. 20, and you can expect some holders to sell TWLO stock, driving   down the price. ABloombergarticle summarized this in June:""For Twilio's biggest shareholder, Bessemer Venture Partners,   the wait is almost over. It is positioned for a major pay day   once the lockup period expires in December, allowing it to sell   some or all of its stake. The firm owns 25% of the company.""When Twilio stock announced a secondary stock offering in   October, sharesplunged 14%, so holders of TWLO stock should expect a dip next week.The TakeawayTwilio does seem to be a promising company with a bright   future. Buying TWLO stock at this stage seems very risky,   however, and might not be suited to all investors.This Metric Could Push Facebook Inc (FB)       Stock to DoubleThe possible return is high, but so is the risk. Most   investors should probably resist the temptation to buy in at such   an early stage.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of     the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous High-Yield Dividend Stocks to       Avoid5 Big Banks Offering the Best Canadian Stocks       to BuyThe postShould You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3   Consappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Reasons Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is a Buy Now;12/13/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTechnology companyCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) has been down in the dumps after its most recent earnings report showed that sales in the second quarter were expected to be down 2% to 4%. This news spooked investors and sent Cisco stock down nearly 5%.Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)While CSCO stock certainly has its share of headwinds to worry about in the coming year, it could make for a good long-term bet.makeArticleAd();Transition Time for Cisco StockOne of the reasons Cisco stock is struggling is that the company is in the midst of a transition period and is therefore experiencing some growing pains. CSCO is moving away from its traditional hardware product lines and toward other parts of its business that will remain relevant in the future. The firm is focusing on subscription-based services, security and data centers.If you look at Cisco's results in those areas, the company looks much more promising. The firm saw deferred product revenue for its subscription-based products rise by 48% to nearly $4 billion.10 Ways to Make Money in the Market in 2017The firm's routing and security segments also turned in promising figures, suggesting that once the company completes its transition, growth will continue.CSCO Shareholders Will Be RewardedAnother reason to add Cisco to your portfolio is the potential income that the stock brings to the table. Not only will investors benefit from long-term growth as its business develops, but CSCO stock has a respectable 3.4% dividend yield that is likely to increase further.Cisco holds more than $60 billion overseas, making it one of the biggest beneficiaries of President-elect Donald Trump's promise to rework the corporate tax regime and make it easier for companies to repatriate their funds. Trump has said that the corporate tax issues are at the top of his list of priorities and that he will address them during his first 100 days in office.While Cisco hasn't made any definite remarks about what the firm will do with the money once it is brought back, some part of it will likely make its way back to shareholders in one way or another.Worries Are OverdoneThe market's panic following CSCO's earnings release has made Cisco stock a much cheaper buy. Of course, investors have reason to question the firm's stability in light of the weaker-than-expected second-quarter guidance, but those fears are overdone. Not only is the company in a period of transition, but the firm's business as a whole has proven to be relatively stable.Cisco CEO Chuck Robinssaidthat shareholders ""have too much focus on individual quarters, especially when you look at a service provider, which is dominated by incredibly large accounts."" He believes that ""you have to look at it over time, and not just quarter to quarter."" And he's absolutely right. Cisco may not have a stellar second quarter, but the firm's improvement in key transition areas is a signal that business isn't bad.Cisco stock isn't without its challenges - the company will struggle if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate and customers are less willing to spend on new systems.Should I Buy Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock? 3     Pros, 3 ConsAnother big concern is that the firm's shift toward services puts it in direct competition withAmazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services.The Bottom LineDespite those headwinds, Cisco stock appears ready for a rally and makes for a good buy for long-term investors. Those who are able to wait out a few rough patches will be rewarded when the firm makes its full transition, and the company's dividend payments and the promise of repatriation make the wait that much more bearable.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Best Investments for 20175 Stocks to Buy for DecemberThe post3 Reasons Why Cisco Systems, Inc.

2 Must-Know Investing Tips From Clayton Christensen;12/13/2016;"Motley Fool Explorer advisor Simon Erickson recently spoke with Clayton Christensen, who is the world's pioneer and foremost thinker in the theory of disruptive innovation. (You can listen to their conversation above, or scroll down below for the full transcript.)makeArticleAd();Christensen was the first to coin the term ""disruption"" in his 1997 book,The Innovator's Dilemma. Disruption refers to how smaller, nimbler organizations can introduce new products and services that overthrow larger, more established competitors. The theory of disruption has influenced many in the business world and inspired several Motley Fool recommendations, such asSplunk(NASDAQ: SPLK)  andVeeva Systems(NYSE: VEEV) .Christensen's academic theories are incredibly powerful. But perhaps even more impressive is that he's used them to achieve significant investing returns. He claims his personally managedRose Park Advisorshas returned an average of 36% annuallysince its founding in 2007. How has he managed to achieve these great returns? He shared two of the key qualities he looks for in his investments.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESBe disruptiveWall Street underestimates disruptive companies' ability to move upmarket to increase their sales and profits over time. Be on the lookout for companies whose products are initially inferior to those of the incumbents but are winning customers by introducing different forms of value. ThinkSouthwest Airlines(NYSE: LUV) offering lower-cost regional flights, orNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) offering DVDs by mail.Focus on jobs to be doneCompanies that maximize customers' experience are difficult to displace, which becomes the true source of a competitive advantage. Watch for companies that nail a nagging customer problem with an incredibly effective solution. That can eventually lead to their brands becoming synonymous with the solution. Examples include Ikea's easy-to-assemble furniture,Intuit's(NASDAQ: INTU)  TurboTax product, andStarbucks'(NASDAQ: SBUX)  coffee.Christensen elaborated on each of these during a recent interview. Hear him share his thoughts about the following topics:An overview ofCompeting Against Luck(0:00-2:27 minutes in)Industries undergoing disruption (2:28-5:54)How to build a competitive advantage (5:55-11:30)How companies should define their market (11:31-18:15)How we should think about big data (18:16-21:09)Two specific things to look for in investing (21:10-23:16)To conclude our discussion, he played ""Buy, Sell, or Hold"" (23:17), making calls on several disruptive concepts, includingUberand Bitcoin.Want a few more disruptive investment ideas?

For those who haven't read it, yet, why did you write this book and what was the overview that you're getting at with it?Christensen:Well, it's something that I have seen in my life, and especially as I've tried to help people be better managers. Every time we put a new [product] into the market, we think that our product will be successful. We've done a lot of study of the market and figured out what the competitors are and everything else. So every time we put a product into the market, we think it will be successful.But the reality is that nearly 80% of those products that we think will be successful fail financially in the market, so I [wondered] if innovation is intrinsically unpredictable. [That] you have to roll the dice many times in order to get a few wins, but you can't predict which number will come up on top. Or [whether there is] some other explanation for the unpredictability that we see.And what we decided is the way people like me teach our students [at business schools] how to think of the structure of markets [means] we've created the problem ourselves, and we concluded that unpredictability is not inherent to innovation. We can actually be successful much more frequently than we thought.So that was where the question came from, originally, and the reason why we gave it this title,Competing Against Luck. That most of us think that innovation entails competing against luck, but we don't think that that necessarily is the case.Erickson:Clay, in the book you said it's a book you've been writing for the past 20 years, just in thinking about the business world. We know that you've spent a career molding the theory of disruption. I wanted to ask how your thoughts about disruptive innovation [have] changed over the past two decades.Christensen:Well, they've changed a lot, and I'm glad that they did. You know, never has a good theory just emerged in a perfect state from the person who developed it at the beginning. It's almost always [that] a theory at the beginning [is] half-baked and incomplete. The way a theory gets to have power is that people who read and use it have to find anomalies or things that the theory can't explain. And the only way the theory gets better is if the people who are the authors of the theory are willing to accept the anomalies as an opportunity to improve it.So that's what we did. Some of the anomalies [were] pointed out to us by other academics like us; but by far the most useful ones have been from our MBA students here at HBS. I teach a course that's broadly regarded, and I [tell] the students [the following], as they prepare for a case (because we do it all by the case method).I say, ""You've got three assignments to prepare for every case. The first one is there's a theory that we use in every session of every class, and these are theories about management that emerge from our work or the work of others.""And then the second is, ""You have a case, and I want you to put the theory on like a set of lenses and examine today's case. The question is can you explain why and how this company got in the situation that it's in through the lens of that theory? And then, given that, what does the theory say the management ought to do to resolve the problem?""Then the third one is, ""I want you to come to class prepared to tell Clay Christensen what's wrong with this theory.""And so that way, year after year, day after day, more than 100 students [turn] their brains around to show Clay what it can't explain. And I'm really grateful to them that they took it seriously, and they really were trying to find out what the theory can't explain. So as a consequence, the theory of disruption and the theory of jobs to be done, and a few others, really are much better as a result of [having gone] through this crucible.Erickson:Are there certain things, Clay, which keep coming up? You said that students were always [asking] what's wrong, or how can the initial theory of disruption [be changed]. Are there certain themes that continually came up in your class?Christensen:Yes. Very often they would come up with an example of an industry that didn't get disrupted. Has not ever been disrupted. And maybe the question is [whether] the theory only [applies] to a few situations. For example, hotels for many years have just never been disrupted. Holiday Inn comes up in the 1950s at the low end of every market, but 40 years later, the Holiday Inn has not moved upmarket. The corporation bought Crowne Plaza and part of other businesses at different points in the constellation of hotels, but the Holiday Inn, itself, still is at the bottom of the market. And in a similar way, higher education hasn't been disrupted and we just couldn't explain it.And then as we worked with a couple of our students for their paper, we realized that in describing the theory of disruption, I had always assumed that the trajectory of performance improvement that innovating companies provide [means] they keep introducing better and better products. I assumed that it always had the same trajectory or slope. And it turns out that every market has a different trajectory of improvement [and so I did some studies].The first study about disruption [centered on] the disk drive market and boy, technology moved at a rapid rate in that market. So a company would come in at the bottom of the market and in about eight years they're in the top. I described that market as a place where [00:09:39]. Their whole life was measured in a few years.But then I [reviewed] our study of the steel industry, where the mini-mills came in at the bottom of the market. It took about 50 years for the industry to get turned upside down. And so the rate of technological change has a big impact on how long an industry will go without being disrupted.Then we realized that in hotels and higher education, the trajectory of technological improvement has been zero. There just weren't any new business models that have occurred. And then we realized that oh, my gosh, but wait a minute. Airbnb in hotels is an innovator and a new business model, and they very rapidly have disrupted a significant chunk of hotels. And online learning, in a similar way, is a new business model [and] in just a few years it's turned upside down higher education in many ways.So we realized that when we see disruption not occurring in an industry, the result of that is the impact of technological change differs industry by industry, and it isn't the case that it happens in some industries and not in others; but rather, it occurs when [the pace of] technological progress changes.Erickson:I'll follow that up, perhaps, with a question about competition, because you say that the pace of change differs in different industries, but the investing community has typically looked at the incumbents (the companies that have the highest margins or the strongest cash flows) as a sign of a competitive advantage against others.But then from a lot of your research, we've seen several of these companies are the same ones that get disrupted, whether [it's Eastman Kodak, Cisco, [or] whoever it might be, because of those market shifts and then competition coming in. How can we tell if a competitive advantage is actually sustainable?Christensen:There are two ways, and the most important is that the theory of disruption predicts that if you have an incumbent leader and an entrant company wants to attack them, if that entrant company tries to attack them head-on by winning the best customers of the established leaders, the theory says that the incumbents are going to turn around and try to beat off the entrants and use its resources in powerful ways to beat the entrants.And the theory says that in almost every case, the incumbent wins when an entrant tries to win through what we call sustaining innovations, and sustaining innovations make good products better. And if somebody comes in at the bottom of the market with a product that is so much more affordable and accessible that a whole different population of people can now have access to and use a product that historically was beyond their reach, almost always the incumbent leaders fail.And it has nothing to do with the power of the incumbent or with a lack of power of the entrant; but rather the incumbent leaders don't want to go after it. That's the essence of disruption. And so your question is answered by disruption.Erickson:Yes, it does. It sounds like the competitive advantage of an incumbent for sustaining innovation can't really be understood against a disruptive company that's playing at the lower end [using a] different value in the industry, right?Christensen:That's right, and it is very predictable. And what's interesting, in the question that you asked, is why do investors not get it?Erickson:Right.Christensen:And it's a very interesting question. My son Matthew and I founded an investment company called Rose Park Advisors. It's been operating for about 12 years, now, where we invest in just publicly traded companies. But the policy is if it's disruptive, we buy their stock, and if they are the incumbent and an entrant goes after them, we'll short them occasionally. The greater return on that portfolio for 12 years, now, is 36% on a compounded annual rate of return, and without any shorting or hedging (occasionally we short), but it's not hedged or leveraged. But 36% compounded annual rate of return.Erickson:That's incredible.Christensen:And the ability to do that is known. We publish everything. But investors seem to be a little bit arrogant, I think, and not humble to listen to an academic theory in practice.Erickson:I think it's very interesting when you think about the concept of competitive moats like Warren Buffett has described for decades, versus Jeff Bezos saying your margin is my opportunity. Most of the companies that are capturing all that value are the ones that are destined to be in the sights of disruptive competitors, right?Christensen:No, that's right. And I mentioned there's another type of innovation in which the incumbent can succeed, and that is when the company follows [the jobs to be done in this new book that we published]. And when the incumbent leader has organized himself around developing products to get a job done for customers, it's very hard for incumbents to win that game; because in many ways it makes disruption impossible to accomplish. So that's why we wrote the book. It took us, as you mentioned, 20 years, but we finally were confident that what we were saying was true.Erickson:I wanted to highlight that a little bit - the jobs to be done - because that's one of the real themes of competing against luck in your book. Customers are hiring those companies to perform jobs that lead to progress for them. Another thing the investment community has typically done is categorized companies, whether it's based on industry, or selling products that are of a similar function. But based on this jobs to be done theory, and the research you've done, do you think there's a more effective way for companies to really define their own market and then also their competitor's?Christensen:Oh, absolutely. I think that the way you describe it is exactly right - that the way managers and investors think of the structure of markets is the world is structured by product, category, or customer category. Except that that's not the way that [the world] appears to a customer.Rather what happens - the way the world appears to a customer - is every day, darn it, stuff happens to them. Some jobs that arise in our lives are just little, incremental jobs that happen to us every day, and others are dramatic, breakthrough innovations. But when a job arrives in our lives, it forces us to go out and find something, or buy something, or use something to get the job done. And understanding the job is what's critical.So it's a silly example. Here I am talking to you. I'm 64 years old, unfortunately, and I'm 6'8"" tall, unfortunately. I married a wonderful wife, fortunately. The youngest of our five children, Katy, went to Columbia, unfortunately. And I have all other characteristics and attributes about myself.But none of my characteristics or attributes have yet caused me to pick upThe New York Timestoday. Now, there might be a correlation between my characteristics and the propensity that I would have to buyThe New York Times. Those characteristics don't cause me to do that, nor do our characteristics and attributes cause us to buy any product or service.But rather what causes us to buy something is we have jobs to do, and when we have a job, we've got to find a product that gets the job done. And it's understanding [what the job is] that allows you to harness the causal mechanism behind that choice. That's why we decided predictability was so important to focus on, because if you harness the causal mechanism around a choice, you can predict the future quite well. Do you want me to give you an example?Erickson:Sure.Christensen:The third of our five children, Michael, unfortunately went to Stanford to get a Ph.D. a few years ago, and after he had been there for about a week, he called us up and said, ""Mom and Dad, I found my apartment and I need to furnish my apartment tomorrow."" And what had happened for Michael is he realized he has a job to do, and that is he needs to furnish [his] apartment tomorrow.So I'll ask you, Simon. When I described for you this job that Michael had to do (that he furnish the apartment tomorrow), is there a place where you could go to buy what they're selling to get that job done?Erickson:Sure.Christensen:Where would you go to get the job done?Erickson:Oh, I would try to find whoever has got the best posters of the college I'm going to, if I'm at Stanford, something right by the university that's close and that has everything that you need, as quickly as possible.Christensen:And what company would that be?Erickson:Oh, I believe that you referred toIkeaa couple of times as that company, right?Christensen:Sure, because it's organized around that particular job to be done. And the reason I refer to it is because anybody who's thoughtful about their lives realizes that that name pops into their mind and they have never been disrupted. In fact Ikea has been rolling its business model out around the world for 50 years, and nobody has disrupted them.And it's not that they have any secrets, and it's not that there's no money in it. Their owner is the third richest guy in the world, and yet they have no competition. And the reason is that everybody else that sells furniture is organized around types of furniture. And if I want to compete against those guys, I just have to make better products than they do.But Ikea is organized around the job to be done, and if you do it in that way, then you can describe all of the experiences - in purchase, in use - that Ikea provides in order to nail that job perfectly. And because they organized themselves in a very unique and complicated way, it's very hard for competitors to compete with them. So that's just an example of my thinking about the market in terms of the jobs to be done rather than products as a useful distinction.Erickson:And Clay, you refer to a lot of those companies as purpose brands, correct? The companies that become just synonymous with those jobs. Whether it's Ikea, or TurboTax, or Starbucks, it's the company that immediately when I think of it, I think of why I would go to that company, and it's immediately apparent in my head, right?Christensen:Absolutely right. Absolutely right. V8 Juice.Disney(NYSE: DIS) . There are really important ones all around you, when you look at it.Erickson:Back to the mention you had of correlation versus causality. We're kind of in the buzzword age of big data and artificial intelligence, right now...Christensen:Yes...Erickson:...where you've got tech that can quantitatively search through a ton of data. It's trying to find correlation between those input factors, but it seems like it misses the qualitative aspects that you've described of what the job is to be done, or what it is a customer wants to hire me to do. Is there some way that we could be using big data more effectively?Christensen:That's a great question, and as you probably know, it bothers me a lot that people can think that they can dispense with thinking and simply have somebody else develop an algorithm that will provide the answer. I think a much better way is to put data aside for a minute and try to figure out what causality is. And you can't look at causality - you can't observe causality - when you've got 200,000 points of data in a database.And [in] the case [of] physical sciences, biological sciences, and management science, to observe things you have to look at an N of 1. And if you can explain what happens in that N of 1, then you can try to explain what happens when the N is two and grow it that way. And data can be very valuable if you use it to validate or show anomalies to a theory.But the data doesn't yield the theory itself. The development of a theory comes from an N of 1, and then the validation of the theory, or identifying anomalies to the theory is where data occurs that can be useful. And so big data, to me, [has] nothing big about it. That's the wrong categorization scheme.Erickson:It sounds like we have the wrong buzzword for big data. It should be go back to small data.Christensen:Yes, I think that's exactly right.Erickson:Clay, one of the other things you talk about in the book is organizational structure. You pointed out a study done by, I believe, Bain Consulting, [which showed that] two-thirds of corporate reorganizations are actually destroying value and not accomplishing what they intended to do.Christensen:Uh-huh.Erickson:Why is it that businesses are so bad at reorging?Christensen:Boy, that's a great question. To me, the answer is there's a difference between interdependent and modularity in the architecture of systems. Some architectures are interdependent; that is, if you change one thing, it affects the way all of the other elements of the system have to change, as well. You have to do everything in order to do anything. And if you change one thing, you have to change everything, so you have to understand the whole system.And a modular system is one which each component interfaces with the other components in standardized ways. And when you have a modular system, it's real easy to map that architecture onto an org chart that you can stick up on a wall, because somebody has to be responsible for [every component]: for making it, and designing it, and manufacturing it, and testing it, and replenishing it, and so on. So the organizational chart on the wall reflects the architecture of the product or service. And when you change the org chart, you have to develop a different modular architecture so that people can snap the pieces together in a different way.In a product that is interdependent, then an org chart almost always creates more problems than they resolve, because if you change one thing, you have to change everything. And I think the key reason for your question (why [organizational] changes eliminate more value than [they create]) is managers don't take the time to understand the nature of the interdependencies of what they're trying to implement. It's a complicated problem.Erickson:[Is a fair summary of that], then, that markets and products change perhaps faster than organizational structure does?Christensen:Yes, that's a great way to frame it. That's a great way to frame it.Erickson:Yes, a great point. And the last question before I'd like to get in a game of Buy, Sell and Hold with you, Clay. The last question before that, though, is our audience at The Motley Fool is primarily individual investors. You mentioned a bit about your investing, and I wondered if there were specific things that you look for when you're buying stocks or you invest in companies. Are there certain attributes that you personally are looking for as an investor?Christensen:The answer is yes. Number one, are they disruptive?Erickson:I'm not surprised by that.Christensen:Because if you invest in disruptive companies, they move up upmarket in very predictable ways. The analysts don't understand that, and so a disruptive company surprises the investors over and over again - that there is more growth in the product or that company than they thought.Because what the analysts see at the bottom of the market is products, and they don't realize there's a trajectory of improvement over time that surprises the investors over and over again. And so, that's the way you define what is disruptive. It starts at the bottom [and] they move up. And the analysts are too arrogant. They don't understand the theory, and so they're surprised over and over again.And in a similar way, if you focus on [investing in] companies that are organized around a job to be done, they can be the incumbents in an industry, but they can't be disrupted because they're providing all the experiences that customers need to have. They can't be disrupted. So those are two rules that we follow when we make investments.Erickson:OK. Clay, before we let you go, we have to have a little bit of fun. We wanted to spot you up with game of Buy, Sell, or Hold.Christensen:All right.Erickson:Not talking specific companies, but I'm going to throw you a couple of concepts in a lightning round kind of format where you can conceptually buy, sell, or hold them based on your level of conviction in their future relevance. So larger role in the future is a buy, less of a role is a sell, and more data (you don't really know) is a hold. Are you ready?Christensen:Tell me those rules again.Erickson:So a buy would be you are very bullish on this concept in the future.Christensen:Buy, sell, hold. OK.Erickson:Are you ready?Christensen:Yup.Erickson:Topic one. Buy, sell, or hold in the big data era companies continuing to use small focus groups for market research?Christensen:Buy.Erickson:Why is that?Christensen:Because I already gave the answer to that question.Erickson:Yes, fair enough on that. Topic two. Buy, sell, or hold accountable care organizations and just organizations that focus more on outcomes rather than procedural reimbursements as a part of the US healthcare system?Christensen:I'd say hold. I'm not sure I could answer your question because the way you frame it, I think is not consistent with itself. Accountable care organizations, overall, I would sell, because I don't think that they are organized in a way that help companies solve problems for customers. Sometimes an accountable care organization collectively develops enough clout that the bigger players can be bigger. But as a solution to healthcare problems, I'd pretty strongly give it a sell.Erickson:Next up, Clay. Buy, sell, or hold the future of traditional four-year universities?Christensen:That's a sell.Erickson:Why is that?Christensen:Including the Harvard Business School.Erickson:The reason for that? [Are you thinking] more online learning? What's the direction you're taking?Christensen:That's right. We have not spent any energy at all trying to control the costs of higher education, and tuition has increased at a faster rate than the cost of healthcare, for example. It is so expensive that it is very hard for a graduating student to get a job in an operating company anymore, because operating companies can't pay the salary that our graduating students need in order to pay off their student loans. So our students have to take a job with venture capitalists, or private equity shops, or consulting firms. But operating companies can't hire people with a Harvard MBA. That's why it's a sell.Erickson:Fair enough. The next one is buy, sell, or hold Uber?Christensen:Hold. Their model has been a wonderful model, and it's been [disruptive in the past], in that its business model is hard for a taxi to put their arms around. But I think that model is understood, now, and it's not clear how many other industries can be Uberized. There might be some, but there are lot of interdependencies that I [still] need to think it through.Erickson:Well, I'll be looking for ""uberize"" in the dictionary, because I'm pretty sure that's going to be a verb that's going to get a lot of attention.Christensen:No kidding.Erickson:Last one for you, Clay. Buy, sell, or hold the future of digital currencies such as bitcoin?Christensen:That's a buy in a different way than many people think. The problem is that there is so much money around the world. The graduates of our business schools become leaders of large corporations and they spend their energy on what we call efficiency innovation; that is, squeezing more and more free cash flow out of the companies that they run. And as a result of that, there is just money everywhere, and the cost of money is essentially zero. So the essence of what a bank historically has been becomes obviated, now, when the cost of capital is zero.So the very concept of data - the different definition of capital needs to change. And I don't know what that is, but the bitcoin is a concept that I think is something I would invest in.Erickson:Clayton Christensen is the Kim B. Clark Professor at Harvard Business School. He's twice been named the world's most influential business thinker in a biennial ranking conducted by Thinkers50 and he is the author of the recent bookCompeting Against Luck. Clay, this was a lot of fun. Thanks for being with us this afternoon.Christensen:Oh, it's been fun to do it. Call me again. I like to keep buying and selling things.Erickson:That is the most fun we always have, is with the game Buy, Sell, and Hold at the end.Christensen:All right. Congratulations.Erickson:I really enjoyed it. Thanks very much, Clay.Christensen:You're welcome.[End]Simon Ericksonowns shares of Netflix, Splunk, Starbucks, Veeva Systems, and Walt Disney.

How To YieldBoost Cisco Systems To 5.9% Using Options;12/12/2016;"Shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.5% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $35 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.54 bid, which annualizes to an additional 2.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost), for a total of 5.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $35 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CSCO shares would have to climb 16.1% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 21.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for CSCO below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.5% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing CSCO's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 covered call at the $35 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $35. (Do most options expire worthless? This and six other common options myths debunked). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cisco Systems, Inc.

Our 3 Favorite Stocks to Invest in the Internet of Things;12/12/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the growing network of   connected sensors and devices, and the increasing connectivity is   already having significant impacts at the consumer, enterprise,   and public levels. Research firmGartnerexpects the number of IoT devices to grow from 6.4 billion in   2016 to nearly 21 billion in 2020, and estimates that more than   half of new business systems and processes will utilize the   Internet of Things by the end of that period. Growth in device   connectivity and machine-to-machine communication is creating an   explosion of new data, and this information is being sorted and   analyzed to produce insights that can improve efficiency and   drive substantial economic value.makeArticleAd();With the Internet of Things triggering big shifts in commerce   and industry, some of the companies leading the push are poised   to be major beneficiaries. In order to help investors ride   the trend, we've asked three Motley Fool writers to pick their   top Internet of Things stock. Read on to learn whyAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Verizon(NYSE: VZ) , andCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) made the list.Buy the network, not the device makersBrian Feroldi(Verizon):There's no doubt that the Internet of Things trend offers   tremendous growth opportunities for all kinds of tech companies.   However, I personally do not think that buying an electronic   hardware manufacturer is the right way to play the trend. The   reason? Huge growth potential will attract a lot of   competition. Over time, that competition will erode away profit   margins, leaving investors with poor returns.For that reason, I think it is a far smarter idea to buy   shares of a cellular network provider like Verizon Communications   instead. After all, those billions of devices that are expected   to come online will need access to a mobile network in order to   work. That provides Verizon with a great new avenue for growth in   the years ahead.You might not be aware of it, but Verizon is already   benefiting from the IoT trend. Last quarter, Verizon's IoT   revenue grew by 24% to $217 million, making it one of the   company's fastest-growing divisions. Sure, that's still just a   drop in the bucket when compared with the company's wireless and   wireline revenue, but over time IoT revenue holds promise to grow   like wildfire. That could help propel the company's   long-term revenue and profit growth.Verizon certainly believes that the IoT represents a huge   opportunity, which is why it is investing accordingly. Earlier   this year, Verizon bought Telogis and Sensity Systems, both of   which will add to the company's IoT product offering. Over time I   think investors should expect even more bolt-on acquisitions to   ensure that it maintains a strong foothold in this important and   growing market. Throw in a dividend yield that tops 4.6% and I   think Verizon is a great way for conservative investors to get   their IoT exposure.An unlikely leaderChris Neiger(Amazon.com):The e-commerce giant probably isn't the first company you   think about when talking about the Internet of Things, but I   think it has a few key advantages in the space.First, Amazon is already a leader in the consumer IoT space.   Its Echo speaker is paired with its robust virtual assistant,   Alexa, to power everything from turning on the sprinklers to   ordering an Uber. This may not seem earth-shattering right now,   but Amazon continues to open up Alexa to developers to connect   the virtual assistant to even more devices and tasks. As it does   that, I think it'll continue to lead in the house-automation   space.The second advantage is the company's Dash Replenishment   Service (DRS). This built-in software allows home electronics   like washing machines to automatically order more detergent from   Amazon's website when they notice that they're running low.   Automation is a key ingredient in the IoT, and Amazon is making   this a reality and already hasGeneral Electric,Samsung, andWhirlpoolon board. DRS may take a while to take off, but as it does   you'll see Amazon lock customers -- and device makers -- even   further into its retail ecosystem.And last but not least, Amazon's true IoT opportunity comes   from its cloud server business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's   no secret that Amazon's AWS business is booming, bringing in $3.2   billion in the third quarter of this year, and $11 billion over   the past four quarters. And the company is leveraging that   success for the IoT as well, by pushing its AWS IoT platform. AWS   IoT allows developers to interact with connected devices and   helps them collect and analyze data. With so many companies and   developers already using AWS for their hosting needs, I think   it'll be natural for them to migrate to AWS IoT as more devices   come online.Amazon's lead in the cloud-computing space, along with its own   IoT platform, means that the company is poised to benefit from   the nearly 50 billion IoT devices that will be online by 2020.   Even if Amazon fails in the consumer IoT space, its AWS offerings   in the IoT space will benefit the company for years to come.Own the company that owns the networkKeith Noonan(Cisco):Overcoming security and standardization issues that arise from   moving data between disparate devices and networks is one of the   main obstacles to the evolution of connectivity, and no company   is better suited to deal with it than Cisco. The company's   Internet of Things and Applications Group vice president, Rowan   Trollope, recently said that the company can deliver many of the   connectivity and security needs brought on by IoT because ""it   owns the network."" There's some simplification involved in that   statement, but Cisco's leading position in networking means that   the company is going to have a formative impact on the   progression of IoT.The company is in the process of giving device makers tools   and applications-programming interfaces to help with   standardization and to cut down on security threats that could   limit the progression of the tech. Cisco is taking these steps to   get the big players on board with its network and certification   process in order to facilitate its transition to a more   subscription-based business model. This year, the company   purchased Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion in order to   bolster its service offerings and fast-track its position in IoT   connectivity and analytics platforms.The big connectivity push also presents opportunities that   could lift Cisco's hardware businesses. The networking giant has   partnered withEricsson,Intel, and Verizon for the development of a 5G mobile router, and   could benefit from demand for routers and switches that are   tailored for customers' IoT needs.Priced at just 12.5 times forward earnings estimates, with   roughly $40 billion in cash and short-term investments on the   books, and a 3.5% dividend yield,Cisco stockoffers an inexpensive valuation, hefty returned income, and a   forefront position in the Internet of Things.10 stocks we like better than Verizon     CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Bull of the Day: Acacia Communications (ACIA);12/12/2016;"CouldAcacia Communications(ACIA), the hottest IPO of 2016, still offer significant upside in 2017?makeZacksArticleAd();Many investment banks believe so. And I think the odds are pretty good too. That's why I'm accumulating shares of Acacia over 45% off of its all-time highs above $125.This maker of optical interconnect products for cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers -- think customers like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Verizon (VZ) and Germany's ADVA -- delivered its second earnings report as a public company in early November and the analysts welcomed the outlook.The consensus for 2017 EPS shot up over 22% from $2.34 to $2.87, making it a Zacks #1 Rank Strong Buy again.For a newly public company like this, the analysts will be slow to raise expectations too high until they get to know management and the company's execution history. Since 2016 saw nearly 100% sales growth for Acacia, many doubt this can be repeated and so the consensus projection right now is for 33% revenue growth.But at forward EPS of $2.87, the stock is trading at under 25X. For 33% top line growth, that's growth at a very reasonable price.And my sense is that sales will grow faster because Acacia's optical networking products will be in high demand as the cloud buildout demands more 100G speed. The 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol is designed to deliver data at 100 gigabits per second.Here's a chart of Acacia's rise to investing stardom since the May IPO around $30 and the subsequent 62% fall back to reality...The Acacia OpportunityThe stock has pulled back quite a bit, but the growth story is still intact. Let's look at five ""technical"" facts first as they tell their own story of what the institutions think of the fundamentals:1. Stock down over 25% since secondary of 4.5 million shares that was priced at $100 -- when it was trading $90! That was BOLD!2. 180-day lockup expiration was Nov 9 and shares have held $65-67 area, even after Nov 4 lows of $61.80.3. Earnings were Nov 10 and they certainly helped support stock above that $65-67 support area.4. Shares tested 62% retracement of $27 all-time lows (since May IPO) to the $128 all-time highs over the summer. I don't get precise with Fibs and the market wasn't either, with the 62% RT in the mid-$60s and the recent low, during the early November market swoon, at $61.80.5. Shares ran to $79 in late Nov, then retested $65 in early Dec for a nice bounceThe bottom line: A lot of big players probably got hurt on the summer run-up above $100 and into the secondary offering. The stock had been trading above $100 from mid-August through September when the secondary came.But my sense is that if anybody was still itching to sell before or after the lockup expiration, they already did. There is one more caveat on that front coming up. Meanwhile take a look at the sales and earnings estimates...The Analysts Before and After EarningsSeveral research analysts were busy upgrading the company before the secondary and they haven't changed their tune since.Bank of America restated a Buy rating and bumped their PT from $88 to $130 in a research report on September 5.Deutsche Bank raised their price target on Acacia from $90 to $125 and gave the stock a Buy rating in a research report on September 9. They reiterated their stance on Nov 30.Needham & Company raised their price target from $100 to $125 and gave the stock a Buy rating in a research report on October 11, right before the secondary. They reiterated their stance on Nov 26.Goldman Sachs restated a Neutral rating on shares of Acacia on October 12, the day the secondary was announced.Cowen & Co. reiterated their Outperform rating on Nov 10 and raised their PT from $90 to $99.Finally, William Blair analysts raised their 2018 revenue expectations and took a more bullish view of Acacia's revenue opportunities and operating model post-earnings. ""We are maintaining our expectations for 30% revenue growth in 2017 while moving 2018 growth to 20% from 17%."" They reiterated their Outperform rating.The CaveatThere is another lock-up expiration on Jan 5 where early investors will be eligible to sell as much as 24.6 million shares. While I am accumulating shares under $70, we don't know what kind of selling we'll see by the big guys and gals in early January. It could bring lower prices, or it may not as they decide to hold on for the growth story and bigger gains.Maybe even a revisit of the old highs above $125 in 2017. That's my bet.Want to see all of today's Strong Buys?Today's Bull of the Day is just one of 220 Zacks Rank #1 stocks. Right now the full, up-to-the-minute list is available to you free of charge.

Cisco (CSCO) Wins Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against Arista;12/12/2016;"makeZacksArticleAd();Per aReutersreport on Friday,Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOwon another patent ruling against Arista NetworksANETregarding the use of Cisco's network device technology in Arista's Ethernet switches without the former's permission.As per Mary Joan McNamara, the judge who presided over the case at the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), two of Cisco's patents were infringed by Arista. Although the ruling is scheduled for a review over the next few months by the commission, if found guilty, it could lead to a ban on Arista's products being imported in the U.S.Cisco had filed the case in Dec 2014 alleging that Arista used Cisco's patented technologies in its switches to enhance performance and speed of networked devices and computers.CISCO SYSTEMS PriceCISCO SYSTEMS Price|CISCO SYSTEMS QuoteWhat does this Win Mean for Cisco?Currently, Cisco is the largest manufacturer of switching systems that connect servers within data centers as well as the ones used to connect to the Internet. However, competition in the switching business is intense given the presence of major players such as Huawei, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CompanyHPE, Juniper Networks, Inc.JNPRand Arista.Notably, Arista, which was founded in 2004 by two former Cisco executives, has been slowly gaining traction in the switching space, which is a major concern for Cisco.As per an IDC report, the worldwide Ethernet switching market generated total revenue of $6.29 billion in the third quarter of 2016, up 2% on a year-over-year basis. On the other hand, total revenue for worldwide enterprise and service provider router market was $3.56 billion, which grew 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.While Cisco's combined revenues out of its service provider and enterprise routers declined 4.8% on a year-over-year basis, Arista's Ethernet switching revenues grew 31.5% on a year- over-year basis.Although Cisco rules 53.3% of the market share in the switching business, the company is reluctant to lose business to a competitor such as Arista, which is emulating the moves of the switching giant.Stock Price OverviewShares of Cisco have performed in-line with the broader Zacks Computer Networks industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock has returned 10.7%, the industry generated a return of 10.2%.The not-so-impressive behavior of the stock could be primarily due to intensifying competition from several smaller players, slowing order growth from service providers and challenges in the emerging markets.Zacks RankAt present, Cisco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Juniper, sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant Cisco;12/9/2016;"Without its stellar group of ""cloud titan"" customers, network   gear makerArista Networks'(ANET) rise in the data center switching market vs. goliathCisco Systems(CSCO) might never have happened.Now it's poised to make an even stronger move in the market,   provided it can hang on to those customers, the likes of which   includeMicrosoft(MSFT),Facebook(FB),Netflix(NFLX),Apple(AAPL), Alphabet'sGoogle(GOOGL),eBay(EBAY)  andYahoo(YHOO).These tech behemoths all buy speedy network switches and   software for use in data centers that provide cloud computing   services from Arista, even though industry leader Cisco now holds   nearly 60% of the data center-switching market. Many of those   companies will rely on Arista more as they crave faster network   speeds to whisk content and apps to mobile devices or, in   Netflix's case, stream high-quality video.makeArticleAd();While some of Arista's blue-chip clients are now developing   their own switching hardware, a development that has some   analysts worried, others say Arista's software expertise gives it   an edge as the market evolves.""Arista is gaining share by focusing on the needs of a very   demanding set of data center customers. They have a big presence   with (web) hyperscalers, the cloud titans,"" said Brad   Casemore, an analyst at research firm IDC.Arista had about 8.4% of the market in slower Ethernet   switching in 2015, but its share is double that in higher-speed   40- and 100-gigabit sectors. Consequently, Arista's share of the   overall market is close to 10%, Casemore estimates. IDC   expects demand for 40- and 100-gigabit switches to boom through   2020 and for Arista to grow along with that.It's all helped Arista see its revenue jump 35% in the first   nine months of 2016 to $801 million. Its stock has nearly doubled   since reaching a low in early February. But shares dipped 1.4% to   93.14 Monday after a judge ruled that the company had infringed   on patents held by Cisco.Moving To The CloudWhen it was founded in 2004, Arista first went after banks   that needed high-speed switching for equities trading. Four years   later, it began focusing on cloud data centers, says   Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal.""When we spotted the cloud opportunity we were almost too   early for it,"" Ullal told IBD in an interview. ""What we saw was   the rise of cloud companies, the proliferation of mobile devices   and new cloud applications that were very different than   enterprise applications, very distributed, and that required a   network that could aggregate information in a real-time   fashion.""Arista's Ethernet switches speed up communications between   computer servers packed into the data centers, and interconnect   racks of servers in different buildings so they behave like one   data center. While Arista has feasted on cloud networking, some   of its internet customers - notably Facebook - have been   developing their own data center technology.Facebook and Google have pioneered open-source software   concepts in data centers. They lowered data center costs by   running software on so-called ""white-box"" servers, built by   lesser-known suppliers from Asia.One worry is that cloud builders may use contract   manufacturers to make their own network switches - basically   servers with built-in, high-speed communications functions - at   the expense of Arista, Cisco and other suppliers. Ullal says   Arista isn't worried about the white box trend.[ibdchart symbol=""ANET"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter""   position=""rightchart"" ]""We're a software company,"" she said. ""We   could run on anybody's white box if customers wanted it. We don't   view what Facebook or other companies do as a threat, we see it   as an opportunity and as collaboration.""Facebook's ThreatSome analysts aren't so sure. When Facebook, Arista's   second-biggest customer behind Microsoft, in November announced   ""Backpack,"" its first 100-gigabit switch, it set off alarm   bells among industry watchers at Goldman Sachs.""Facebook believes it now has a full road-map to building a   data center,"" a report from the investment bank said. ""We view   these developments as a long-term negative for data center   switching vendors Arista, Cisco, andJuniper (Networks)(JNPR).""IDC says original design manufacturer, or ODM, switch makers -   contract manufacturers of white-box switches - had 12.3% of the   100-gigabit data center market in 2015, third in market share   behind Cisco and Arista. Players in that market include   Cumulus, Pluribus Networks, and Big Switch.Peter Christy, an analyst at 451 Research, says it's a ""fact   of life"" that Google,Amazon.com(AMZN) and Facebook design and engineer their own massive data   centers. Microsoft is less focused on white-box switch   replacement, analysts say.""They have unique networks,"" Christy told IBD. ""It's a real   problem for the switching industry that the highest growth   segment is increasingly being (sourced) internally.""Worries Overblown?But Mark Moskowitz, analyst at Barclays, says worries over   Facebook's switching venture and those of others may be   overblown.""While cloud service providers from time-to-time experiment   with homegrown switching applications, such initiatives are not   to fully displace the merchant suppliers,"" Moskowitz said in a   report. ""In certain cases, these homegrown efforts are designed   to influence the technology road maps of the merchant   suppliers.""Citigroup analyst Stanley Kovler said in a report that   Arista's risk of market share loss due to the white-box trend is   ""negligible as Arista's products are primarily in the core,   complex part of the data center.""IBD'S TAKE:Arista shares broke out above 90 in late November and have     reached new all-time highs in several sessions since then. The     company is at the top of the class among networking companies     in performance. For a stock checkup on Arista, checkhere.IDC's Casemore says the white box trend as well as competition   from China-based Huawei in switching are reasons why Arista is   pushing into the $13 billion network router market, taking on   Cisco and Juniper. Routers whisk data from data centers across   the internet. Arista is using a new Broadcom chip called   ""Jericho"" in router products, now in trials.Arista, which has over 4,000 switching customers, aims to have   over 100 routing customers by mid-2017. Morgan Stanley, in a   report, estimates that Arista could garner $200 million to $300   million in revenue from router products by 2020.""Network design is changing. It's getting more difficult to   distinguish switching from routing,"" Ullal said. ""This is a   natural opportunity for us, but it's not going to happen   overnight.""$1 Billion In SalesArista, which raised $226 million in its 2014 initial public   offering, now is on track to easily top $1 billion in 2016 sales.   Barclay's Moskowitz says it could hit $2 billion by 2020 based on   share gains in the data center switching market alone.Aside from its push into the routing market, Arista aims to   target the corporate market through a new alliance withHewlett-Packard Enterprise(HPE). And, it aims to grow revenue from government customers as   well.Family trusts formed by co-founders Andy Bechtolsheim and   David Cheriton hold about 27% of outstanding shares, while   Arista's top 10 shareholders own nearly 67% of the company's   float, says Thomson Reuters.To keep its edge, Arista Networks has been spending 20% to 22%   of sales on research and development.""Networking has been written off as being mature, but Arista   is redefining networking for our customers,"" Ullal said. ""The   company was really built by engineers for engineers."""

The company remains well positioned for growth on the back of its solid market position, ongoing expansion and digital initiatives and significant opportunities from the secular shift towards electronic payments. Notably, the company has filed for four Blockchain patents as it tries to integrate blockchain-based transactions in its own systems. The proposed acquisition of a major stake in VocaLink will strengthen its electronic payment capabilities. Further, the latest dividend hike & share buyback program reaffirmed MasterCard's commitment to enhance shareholders' value. However, escalating costs, a challenging forex environment and legal issues remain concerns. (You canread the full research report on MasterCard     here>>)Merckshares have gained more than 14% year-to-date on the back of strong momentum in its product pipeline. The company's better than expected Q3 results and positive guidance also added to the momentum as well. The analyst likes Merck's new products, especially Keytruda, which should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line. The latest FDA approval of Keytruda for the first line treatment of metastatic lung cancer should sharply improve the drug's sales. Merck has also made significant progress with its pipeline and is working on bringing new products to the market. However, generic competition and pricing pressure will continue to pressurize the top line.

Top Research Reports for Cisco, Merck & MasterCard;12/7/2016;"makeZacksArticleAd();Wednesday, December 7 2016Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including MasterCard (MA), Merck (MRK) and Cisco (CSCO).Buy ratedMasterCardshares have struggled this year, but they have performed relatively better compared to Visa (V) and its broacer peer group. The company remains well positioned for growth on the back of its solid market position, ongoing expansion and digital initiatives and significant opportunities from the secular shift towards electronic payments. Notably, the company has filed for four Blockchain patents as it tries to integrate blockchain-based transactions in its own systems. The proposed acquisition of a major stake in VocaLink will strengthen its electronic payment capabilities.  Further, the latest dividend hike & share buyback program reaffirmed MasterCard's commitment to enhance shareholders' value. However, escalating costs, a challenging forex environment and legal issues remain concerns. (You canread the full research report on MasterCard here>>)Merckshares have gained more than 14% year-to-date on the back of strong momentum in its product pipeline. The company's better than expected Q3 results and positive guidance also added to the momentum as well. The analyst likes Merck's new products, especially Keytruda, which should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line. The latest FDA approval of Keytruda for the first line treatment of metastatic lung cancer should sharply improve the drug's sales. Merck has also made significant progress with its pipeline and is working on bringing new products to the market. However, generic competition and pricing pressure will continue to pressurize the top line.

In the updated research report issued today, the Zacks analyst covering the stock highlights Cisco's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Pure Storage, salesforce.com and IBM will help Cisco to gain significant traction in the data center, cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) market in the long haul.

Juniper Networks Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know;12/7/2016;"2016 has been a year of disappointments for investors inJuniper Networks(NYSE: JNPR) . After beginning the year with a stock price of $27   and change, Juniper stock now looks set to end the year right   back where it began.And yet, if you ask the analysts at Credit Suisse, 2016's   miserable performance sets up Juniper stock to outperform in   2017. This morning, the investment banker announced it is   upgrading Juniper Networks stock to outperform. What's more,   after crunching the numbers on likely revenue and profit margin   growth, Credit Suisse says it's upping its price target on the   stock as well -- to $31 a share.makeArticleAd();Here are three things you need to know about that.Credit Suisse thinks it's time to plug into Juniper Networks   stock -- but is it right? Image source: Getty Images.1. Sales are on the upswingQuoted onStreetInsider.comthis morning, Credit Suisse argues that despite what its stock   price might suggest to you, ""Juniper is transitioning through the   IT disruption and volatile service provider market successfully.""   The company boasts ""a strong product portfolio,"" and   ""increasingly diversified product offerings"" that, says Credit   Suisse, will enable Juniper to grow its revenue at about 3.7% to   3.8% over the next couple of years.2. Profits are growing, tooGranted, though sub-4% sales growth might not sound   impressive, it would at least be an improvement over the   performance Juniper turned in this year. According to data fromS&P   Global Market Intelligence, the most Juniper stock has managed to produce so far this year   is sales growth of 1.9% over 2015 levels. Thus, a move to 3.8%   sales growth, for example, would actually be twice as fast as   Juniperhasbeen growing. And Credit Suisse believes these greater sales will   ""drive operating leverage"" at Juniper, resulting in at least   ""gradual EPS growth.""According to the analyst, Juniper is likely to earn $2.29 per   share in fiscal 2017, and then $2.40 per share in FY2018. Both   those numbers would be a nice improvement over the $1.59 in   per-share earnings that Juniper produced last year, and even   compared to the $2.07 per share that analysts are   forecasting for 2017.3. What's driving the growth?Credit Suisse believes Juniper is gaining on rivals such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) ,Hewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) , and Huawei in the battle for market share in   ethernet switches -- but here's where the analyst's argument   begins to fall apart. In Q2 2016, market researcherIDC notedthat Juniper suffered a 4.3% decline in revenues at its switching   business, despite 3% overall growth in the ethernet switching   market worldwide. This indicated a shrinking market share, and   according toIDC data, this trend continued into Q3.As worldwide switcher sales grew 2%, Juniper's sales declined   3.5% to just $222 million last quarter. And while that was a   better performance than Juniper showed in Q2, and showed   sequential growth, it still indicated continued market share   slippage year over year.Granted, Juniper rivals Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Cisco   fared poorly last quarter as well, with switching revenue   declining 4.3% and 5.4% respectively. But the market share gains   that we're seeing clearly aren't accruing to Juniper Networks,   but rather to its rival Huawei -- whose revenue surged 91.6% year   over year.The most important thing: ValuationFinding this flaw in Credit Suisse's buy thesis, must we now   reject Credit Suisse's argument entirely? Sadly, I believe the   answer to this question is ""yes.""With $602 million in trailing net income, Juniper stock sells   for 16.7 times earnings (net of cash and debt). That may not   sound overly expensive, but most analysts who follow the stock   agree that Juniper is unlikely to grow its profits at more than   11% annually over the next five years. Credit Suisse's forecast   of $2.29 per share in profits next year, up 11% from this year's   projected $2.07, doesn't hold out much promise of this growth   rate improving anytime soon.When you consider, further, that Credit Suisse's projection is   based on Juniper Networks enjoying gains in ethernet switching   market share -- gains that IDC's data entirely fail to confirm --   it follows that Juniper's business isn't nearly as strong as   Credit Suisse seems to think it is. To the contrary, of the top   five players in this particular segment of the internet equipment   market, Juniper remains the weakest.I think Credit Suisse is wrong to recommend it.10 stocks we like better than Juniper NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Risky Is FireEye Inc Stock?;12/7/2016;"Cybersecurity firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) lost nearly 40% of its market value this year due   to sluggish sales growth, cash burn concerns, and major executive   departures. But now that FireEye trades at a 35% discount to its   IPO price of $20, is the stock still too risky to touch? Let's   examine its headwinds, tailwinds, cash flows, and valuations to   find out.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The headwindsFireEye's revenue rose 13% annually to  $186.4 million   last quarter, representing its slowest year-over-year growth rate   since its 2013 IPO. The company expects to finish fiscal 2016   with 15%-16% sales growth and 4%-6% billings growth -- which is a   big  drop from its 46% sales growth and 35% billings growth   in 2015.FireEye blamed that slowdown on its ongoing shift from on-site   security appliances to subscription-based services like FireEye   as a Service (Faas). Competition also remains fierce --Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) bundles threat prevention solutions with its   networking hardware and software, andPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) andFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) have integrated threat prevention features into   their next-gen firewalls.FireEye also lost several key executives over the past two   years. CFO Michael Sheridan resigned last year, CEO David DeWalt   stepped down this June, and  founder Ashar Aziz resigned   from the board of directors in September.The tailwindsFireEye's current CEO is Kevin Mandia, who joined the company   after FireEye acquired his company Mandiant in 2014. Mandia is   trying to boost FireEye's margins with hundreds of layoffs and   widening its moat with  Helix, an all-in-one platform that   bundles together many of FireEye's services with a single user   interface. If it can successfully pivot away from appliances and   toward FaaS, Helix, and its other subscription-based services,   FireEye's revenue growthmightaccelerate again.Mandia is not actively trying to sell FireEye, but the company   is still frequently cited as a takeover target for companies like   Cisco. Its Mandiant and iSight threat detection technologies are   still considered ""best in breed"" solutions, and it serves over   5,000 customers across  67 countries -- including nearly   half the Forbes Global 2000.The cash flowsUnder DeWalt, FireEye repeatedly struggled to generate   positive cash flows. FireEye relied on secondary stock and   convertible debt offerings to generate more cash, but those moves   diluted existing shares and undermined investor confidence.FireEye's big stock-based compensation expenses, which gobbled   up 32% of its revenues during the first nine months of 2016, also   prevented it from becoming profitable on a GAAP-adjusted basis.   Mandia's decision to reduce its workforce and implement other   cost-cutting measures is clearly aimed at getting those costs   under control.Between the third quarters of 2015 and 2016, FireEye's gross   margin rose from 73% to 74%, its operating margin improved from   -32% to -14%, and its operating cash flow rose from negative $8.3   million to $14.1 million. Thanks to those bottom line   improvements, FireEye expects to generate positive free cash   flows for all of 2017. That would mark the first time that   FireEye haseverreported positive free cash flow since its IPO.Source:YChartsThe valuationsFireEye's enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 2.7 is lower than   Palo Alto and Fortinet's respective EV/Sales ratios of 7.3 and   3.4, and its enterprise value of $2 billion is a fairly   affordable target for bigger tech players. However, FireEye's   EV/FCF ratio (an oft-used metric to measure high-growth   companies) comparesverypoorly to Palo Alto, Fortinet, and many other cybersecurity   players due to its negative free cash flow.Source:YChartsIf FireEye's FCF rises to positive territory next year, its   valuation would look much safer for investors and potential   acquirers, and its stock could rebound. However, Mandia's plan to   downsize FireEye in the face of rising competition could also   backfire if its sales and marketing teams get outgunned by teams   from larger rivals like Cisco, Palo Alto, and Fortinet.So how risky is FireEye?FireEye has certainly taken steps in the right direction, but   it's still averyrisky stock. Its plan to pivot from appliances to services while   downsizing sounds reasonable on paper, but it could be tough to   pull off amid unpredictable enterprise spending and tough   competition.Therefore, my overall impression of FireEye has improved, but   I think conservative investors would be better off sticking with   Cisco orSymantec, while investors who can stomach more volatility should take a   closer look at the profitable niche playerCyberArkinstead.10 stocks we like better than FireEyeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Ericsson Plagued with Headwinds: Should You Sell the Stock?;12/7/2016;"makeZacksArticleAd();Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ)ERIChas been grappling with numerous headwinds in recent times and its share price trend reflects the same. Year to date, the company's shares have plunged 43.2%, significantly underperforming the Zacks categorized Telecommunications Equipment industry average negative return of 2%.Further, the company's earnings estimates also moved south over the past couple of months. Ericsson has seen five downward estimate revisions compared with none upward, in the past 60 days. This has led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings to go from 57 cents to 34 cents during the same time period, which indicates decidedly bearish analyst sentiment for the stock.Declining mobile broadband demand, persistent softness in emerging markets and slow progress of cost-cutting efforts have been plaguing Ericsson's results. Further, softness in broader macroeconomic conditions and slow MBB spending have cast further pressure on its operations.The impact of these issues can be clearly seen in the company's recent quarterly results. Ericsson has had a dismal earnings track record in recent times, characterized by three consecutive earnings misses in the four trailing quarters, for an average earnings miss of 23%.However, 2017 could be a turnaround year for Ericsson, as its cost-savings program turn meaningfully productive and end-market demand rebounds. We believe that Ericsson's recent partnership with Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOwill boost its product line up and drive sales growth.The company is also steadily fortifying its 5G foothold to benefit from the commercial launch of the technology and foresees bright prospects in the IoT domain with 5G commercialization in 2020.In fact, Ericsson expects Virtual Reality (""VR"") and Artificial Intelligence (""AI"") applications to flourish in the times to come. A recent survey report (the sixth edition of Ericsson's annual trend report: The 10 Hot Consumer Trends for 2017 and beyond) hints at similar trends.The report suggests that virtual reality will be indistinguishable from physical reality in only three years and consumers see AI playing a much more prominent role than before in both society and at work. Further, consumers are increasingly using automated applications, encouraging IoT adoption. Consumer demand also seems to imply that demand for battery-friendly, instant and fast connectivity is set to grow rapidly. In that sense, it indicates a robust need for 5G networks.Ericsson has been focusing on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors. Meanwhile, the impending deployment of 5G networks in 2020 is expected to boost the adoption of IoT devices, with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence. Ericsson, being one of the premier telecom services providers, is well set to capitalize on the demand as operators expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity.However, Ericsson is, at present, struggling with slumping demand in Russia and Brazil, and accelerating negative industry trends have further compounded its problems. The company's mobile broadband sales continue to take a grave beating from adverse industry trends as well as sluggish growth in countries like Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. Further, the company is facing stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co. and Nokia Corp.NOK.ERICSSON LM ADR Price and ConsensusERICSSON LM ADR Price and Consensus|ERICSSON LM ADR QuoteWhether the recent growth and cost-streamlining efforts of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company will help it beat industry-wide demand blues, remains to be seen.Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the same space is Harris CorporationHRS, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

5 Reasons Palo Alto Networks Inc Stock Could Fall;12/6/2016;"Next-gen firewall vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) shed nearly 30% of its value over the past year due   to ongoing concerns about its slowing sales growth, widening   losses, and rising competition. But as Palo Alto hovers near its   52-week low, investors might be tempted to start a position in   this high-growth stock. However, I believe that the stock could   still fall further for five main reasons.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();1. Its high valuationPalo Alto currently trades at 8 times trailing sales. That's a   high P/S ratio compared to many of its cybersecurity peers --Fortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) trades at 4 times sales,FireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) trades at 3 times sales, andSymantechas a P/S ratio of 4.With the market hovering near all-time highs and big investors   rotating out of the tech sector toward energy and financials,   tech stocks with high valuations and zero GAAP profits or   dividends (like Palo Alto) could be highly exposed to big   sell-offs.2. Slowing sales growthPalo Alto posted 34% year-over-year sales growth last quarter,   but that represented its slowest growth rate since its 2012 IPO.   Analysts expect the company to  post 31% sales growth this   year, compared to 49% growth last  year. That slowdown has   been attributed to slower enterprise spending, competition in the   perimeter security space, and a market shift from on-site   appliances to automated solutions and subscription-based software   and services.3. The rise of bundled platformsTo stay competitive in that market, Palo Alto launched its   Next-Generation Security Platform to bundle together natively   integrated technologies, automated protection solutions, and   threat intelligence sharing solutions on  a scalable   platform for businesses.However, rivals like Fortinet and FireEye are also expanding   with similar bundled plays. Fortinet offers an integrated   security platform which bundles additional security services with   its firewall, and FireEye recently unveiled Helix, which bundles   its  threat prevention services together under a single user   interface.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) also bundles next-gen firewalls and other security   tools with its networking hardware and software -- making it   tough for stand-alone players like Palo Alto and FireEye to stay   competitive.4. Widening GAAP lossesPalo Alto's bottom line  growth initially looks solid --   its non-GAAP net income rose 66% annually to $51.2 million last   quarter. But on a GAAP basis, its net loss widened from $39.9   million to $61.8 million. That disparity was mainly caused by its   stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses, which rose 55% annually   last quarter and gobbled up 29% of its revenues.High SBC expenses are common in the competitive Silicon Valley   job market, but that puts Palo Alto at a clear disadvantage   against non-Silicon Valley rivals like Israeli firewall vendorCheck Point Software(NASDAQ: CHKP) -- which spent a mere 5% of its revenue on    SBC expenses last quarter. But if Palo Alto cuts jobs and   SBC expenses, as FireEye is currently doing, it could eventually   be outgunned by its rivals' better-funded R&D and sales   teams.5. Insiders still hate the stockIf Palo Alto shares were considered undervalued, we should see   lots of insider buying. However, insiders actually sold nearly   900,000 shares over  the past six months without buying a   single share on the open market. Many major executives, including   CEO Mark McLaughlin, sold large positions when the stock hit the   $140s earlier this year.Insiders have plenty of reasons to sell their shares, but   those sales seemingly contradict the two-year $500 million   buyback plan the company announced in late August. But as I noted   in aprevious article, that buyback plan is likely aimed at offsetting the share   dilution from its big stock bonuses instead of tightening up its   earnings per share.The key takeawayPalo Alto Networks mightlooklike a great growth stock, but its sales growth is slowing down   and analysts' rosy projections for 32% annual earnings growth   over the next five years are based on its non-GAAP earnings.Palo Alto is still a ""best in breed"" player in the crowded   cybersecurity market, but its stock could keep falling if it   doesn't counter its competitors in the security platform market   and get its costs under control. Therefore, I'd suggest that   investors interested in the cybersecurity market take a closer   look at conservative plays like Cisco or profitable niche players   likeCyberArkinstead.10 stocks we like better than Palo Alto     NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cisco Systems Inc. Is Running out of Room to Grow...What's Next?;12/6/2016;"Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) is a ""mature"" tech stock which many investors likely own for income instead of price appreciation. The networking giant's revenue rose just 3% last year  and is expected to decline  about 2% this year due to sluggish enterprise spending and the commoditization of its core businesses of routers and switches.makeArticleAd();Image source: Cisco.Therefore, investors might be wondering if Cisco can ever grow its business to generate fresh sales growth again. The answer lies in three key markets -- software defined networking, cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things.Software defined networkingSoftware defined networking (SDN) platforms consist of cloud-based networking solutions which depend more on software than hardware. As cloud-based services do the heavy lifting, the need for on-site routers and switches declines and hurts Cisco's core business. Last year, Guggenheim analyst Ryan Hutchinson warned that  Cisco's outlook was clouded by ""uncertainty around future network architectures as more workloads migrate to the cloud.""Cisco's major rival in this space isArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) , which sells data center switches and routers optimized for  SDN platforms. Arista believes that the combination of its Jericho switches and FlexRoute software can replace on-site routers as cheaper SDN solutions. Cisco repeatedly sued  Arista over patent violation claims, but those lawsuits aren't slowing Arista down -- the company is still expected to post  34% sales growth this year.The real way to counter Arista is with better support for SDN platforms. Cisco's hardware is already compatible with OpenFlow, the same open-source protocol used by Arista and  OpFlex, a newer protocol it introduced in 2014. It's unclear if those efforts will work, but Cisco clearly needs to pivot its aging networking hardware devices toward SDN-optimized ones to stay ahead of the tech curve.CybersecurityCisco's fastest growing business is its cybersecurity division, which protects its networking hardware and software from external attacks. The unit was built upon its acquisitions of companies like ThreatGRID, Sourcefire, OpenDNS, and Lancope, and competes directly against perimeter security players like firewall vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) and threat prevention firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) .By bundling its cybersecurity solutions with its networking hardware and software, Cisco gains the advantages of pricing power and scale against these stand-alone competitors. As a result, Cisco's cybersecurity business has become its fastest growing division -- sales rose  13% to $1.97 billion last year and accounted for 4% of its top line. Last quarter, the unit posted 11% sales growth.Image source: Getty Images.During last quarter's conference call , Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins noted that the unit's ""integrated architecture approach and best-in-breed portfolio"" was well-received by customers, and noted that it was driving more recurring subscription-based revenue. Its advanced threat security revenue rose 100%, web security solutions revenue rose 60%, and total deferred revenue -- a key indicator of future demand -- rose 39% annually.Looking ahead, Cisco will likely acquire additional security companies to beef up that portfolio. It acquired cloud security firm CloudLock and containerization company ContainerX last quarter, andrumors suggestthat it could be interested in acquiring FireEye or web application security companyImperva.The Internet of ThingsCisco estimates that the number of connected devices worldwide will double from 25 billion in 2015 to  50 billion in 2020. That so-called Internet of Things (IoT) market includes mobile devices, wearables, home automation appliances, connected cars, drones, and other gadgets.As one of the world's top networking equipment companies, Cisco views the IoT as a natural extension of its networks. That's why the company acquired IoT service platform Jasper Technologies (now known as its IoT Cloud Business Unit) for $1.4 billion earlier this year. Cisco is bundling those IoT services with its routers, switches, and UCS (Unified Computing Systems) servers, which helps it counter competitors in each market.MicrosoftandIBMalready use Jasper's platform to link their cloud customers to  IoT devices.Cisco is also investing heavily in the connected car market. Earlier this year, itpartnered withHyundaito develop in-vehicle network tech for  high-speed data transfers. The companies believe that the platform can bridge the gap between today's connected cars and driverless cars in the near future. Cisco also provides end-to-end security for vehicles, delivers remote diagnostics and services, and lets drivers access third-party cloud services.The key takeawayThe SDN, cybersecurity, and IoT markets all represent great long-term growth opportunities for Cisco, but investors shouldn't expect the company to post double-digit sales growth anytime soon. Its core switches and routers businesses remain under pressure from cheaper rivals likeHuawei, and it's struggling to counter nimbler rivals like Arista.Those challenges won't fade away anytime soon, but I believe that Cisco's forward dividend yield of 3.6%, low payout ratio of 47%, and its P/E of 14 (which is lower than the industry average of 25) still make it a solid income play at current prices.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,just click here.Leo Sunowns shares of Cisco Systems.

Why Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Believers Need to Act Now;12/6/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo sayTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) shareholders have been jostled a bit this year would be a significant understatement. The TWTR stock price started 2016 at $23, fell to a low of $14 by the middle of the year, soared to $25 by early October on rumors that an acquisition was coming, and since then have peeled back to $18 when none of the suggested suitors actually pulled the trigger.makeArticleAd();Source:Freestocks via UnsplashAs the old saying goes, ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" Most owners of Twitter stock, having been burned, aren't apt to get their hopes up again that a buyout is looming.The irony? Now that most investors aren't expecting it, they should probably be expecting it.TWTR Stock: Timing Is EverythingWere the business of buyouts not like junior-high romances, it might be easier to digest the notion that Twitter is still a prime acquisition target. In other words, whispers, rumors, other potential hookups and worries about what everyone else will say can often upset would-be eighth-grade relationships. Ditto for buyouts.And like middle-school love, suitors are kind of funny about getting back together with an ""ex"" whenthings go sour as quickly as they didbetween TWTR andWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), Twitter andSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) and even Twitter andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). TWTR stock wasn't ready to be acquired then, and with conclusions drawn, it could be a while before the company is seen as buyable.5 Tech Stocks That Should Top Your 2016 Christmas Wish ListThe frustrating part: Twitter is still a very ownable company, particularly in the hands of an organization that has dealt with consumers before. In early October though, that simply wasn't the case.Plus, there was the not-so-small matter of a sky-high Twitter stock price that made any deal too rich for most potential buyers by the time any of them could have made an offer.What a Difference Two Months MakesTo be clear, TWTR hasn't successfully completed a turnaround since early October. A turnaround, however, has become much more plausible during that time.For one thing, the power of using Twitter as a means of merging video and social networking has been validated in the meantime. TWTR had served as the venue foronly a second NFL gameby the point when the buyout rumors first surfaced, but there's no denying it was still little more than an experiment at the time. If Walt Disney was looking for decisive evidence that it could revive its struggling ESPN division by melding it with the Twitter platform, it certainly didn't have it at the time.Now, however, that partnership with the NFL is turning heads. The remainder of the ten games Twitter had contracted are airing, andthe league is pleased. In the meantime, Twitter has secured an actual sponsor for two NBA-related livestream programs that will air in the Philippines.It's not just the advent of sports and related television programming that reposition TWTR stock in a fruitful way, however (although its sports partnerships go miles to answering the question ""why should I go to the Twitter page?"") The company is cleaning up its platform, in multiple ways.Had it only been cited by Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff as one of the key reasons he couldn't justify doing a deal, it may have been dismissed. But, it wasn't just Benioff. Most observers agree that Twitter has a bullying problem.It may not matter much right away, but in the middle of November, the company finally started to get serious about dealing with the hateful rhetoric that makes the microblogging platform a liability.Point being, much-needed changes are underway.Bottom Line for Twitter StockIt's never a good idea to own a stock simply because the company is a rumored acquisition target. TWTR stock is no exception. But, when a much-needed turnaround is underway for that company, decent odds of a buyout certainly don't hurt the bullish argument.And yes, there's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for Twitter stock, on its own, or with a partner/buyer.Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Will Pay Off in the Long-TermTWTR still has a lot of problems to solve, to be clear. To that end, the fact that not one single company nibbled two months ago was a wakeup call for Jack Dorsey - changes have to be made. In the meantime, they've started to be made.The catch: Anyone who thinks they can wait to profitably step into Twitter stock on hopes of a buyout right before that news becomes public knowledge is fooling themselves. To avoid the very price run up that turned a bunch of buyers off two months ago, any deal is likely going to be done before any non-insider has any clue an agreement has been made.If you want to make a worthy trade on any buyout potential, you have to own TWTR stock now, when there's no real certainty it's going to happen.But, you could do a lot worse.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Ways to Make Money in the Market in 2017The 10 Biggest Stock Market Successes of 2016The postWhy Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Believers Need to Act Nowappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Will Pay Off in the Long-Term;12/6/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile most stocks remain in the midst of the post-Trump rally, not every name has remained on that bullish train.Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) is one of those few exceptions. Although CSCO stock got November started on a bullish foot, once the company unveiled its fiscal Q1 numbers on Nov. 17, the selling has been brisk. Cisco stock fell 5% that day, and since then, it has continued to lose ground.makeArticleAd();Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)It wasn't exactly the first quarter results, however, that did the bulk of the deed. It was the company's lackluster Q2 outlook (and beyond) that was the concern for owners of CSCO stock. In short, the maker of networking hardware is facing a top-line and bottom-line headwind.Yet, as CiscoCEO Chuck Robbins commentedin the aftermath of the Q1 report, ""You have to look at it over time, and not just quarter to quarter.""He's got a valid point. The question is, what's Cisco going to look like in time, once it completes its paradigm shift? Perhaps more important, what might send CSCO lower should the transition not flow well?CSCO Changing Business ModelCSCO is well established as a networking equipment name. Indeed, the company's moniker became synonymous with networking in the late 90s, and although it has been dinged up a bit, Cisco stock has held onto that crown ever since. Outright sales of hardware was its business model.10 Ways to Make Money in the Market in 2017As technology has changed though (and as competition caught up), CSCO is being forced to adapt. Hardware means less, and software means more.This shift is readily evident in last quarter's revenue mix. Product revenue was down 1%, while service revenue grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. Switching revenue - the company's bread and butter - was off 7%. Conversely, deferred product revenue related to recurring and subscription-based business grew 48%.That's largely by design. As Robbins said of the prior quarter's numbers,""We've continued to have very good core execution in whatever the environment is, and also to shift to more of a software and subscription model. We had another quarter with deferred growing nicely, it was up 48%, at almost $4 billion. And we continue to see fantastic growth in the security business … We are pleased with the continued transition to a software recurring model. For example, the Cisco One business was a point-and-a-half of growth, and that moved into a ratable model last quarter, which would have previously been a one-time sale. And then there's the strength in security, and our collaboration and next-gen data center businesses.""One of the side effects of a recurring revenue model is reliable revenue, which in turn allows for a reliable dividend.And, the companyhasstarted to respect the appeal of payouts. The Cisco dividend has grown from six cents per share per quarter in 2011 to 26 cents per share of CSCO stock now. That translates into a healthy dividend yield of 3.5%, which is on par with stocks more commonly categorized as ""value"" names …an idea yours truly posed in the middle of November.Potential Pitfalls for CiscoWhile it's a necessary step in the right direction as virtualization and software becomes a better, cheaper alternative to hardware, this transition won't necessarily be an easy one.The biggest stumbling block for Cisco stock is the simple fact that the company doesn't have as firm of a hold on the new market that it did on the old one.Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:BRCD) is one of those names that has positioned itself well in the modern era of networking. Its 5600 vRouter is the gold standard in software-based routers.Meanwhile, though Robbins cheered the growth of the company's security services, and that's an even more crowded field.Palo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW),Fortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT) andFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) are just a handful of the companies already in the security business, and with a significant head start on CSCO.Can Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Spend Its Way to Gains?Still, with $71 billion in the bank, it's tough to think Cisco can't buy its way out of any problem it may find itself facing in the foreseeable future.Bottom Line for Cisco StockAlthough it's likely to be a long, frustrating adjustment, it is an adjustment CSCO stock is equipped to handle. The question is, are owners of Cisco stock equipped to handle the adjustment? It could take a long while for CSCO to become the recurring revenue machine it's aiming to be.It may also require something of an adjustment in the valuation-perception of Cisco stock.The good news is that CSCO stock is presently valued at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1 and a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 11.8. That's in line with the market's typical multiple for a value stock. The bad news is, the market may not be ready to view Cisco stock in that way, punishing it for slowing growth … despite the growing stream of reliable revenue.Still, for the true long-termer and fan of income, CSCO could end up being a pleasant surprise.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Tech Stocks That Should Top Your 2016 Christmas Wish ListThe 10 Biggest Stock Market Successes of 2016The postWhy Cisco Systems, Inc.

4 Biggest Losers for the Dow in November;12/1/2016;"makeZacksArticleAd();The Dow ended the month on a winning note, rising during six of the last seven sessions. Setting multiple records over the month, the blue-chip index gained 5.4% over the last thirty days. To a large extent, these gains were largely attributable to Donald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S. presidential elections. Bullish economic data, favorable news from overseas and expectations that GDP growth will continue were the other major reasons for gains made during the month.Most of the index's components notched up significant gains over this period with only a few ending in the red. While some felt the brunt of Trump's proposed policies, others were affected by company specific factors. Overall, the absence of any major downsides helped markets surge over the month.November's PerformanceThe index created eight records over November and breached the 19,000 mark for the first time ever on Nov 22. Markets surged after Donald Trump's election on Nov 8, marking the beginning of a fierce rally for U.S. markets. Bonds fell out of favor as investors rushed to pick stocks which had been out of favor for some time now.Financials were the toast of the month with easier regulations for the sector around the corner.  The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETFXLUslumped over the same period, losing 3.5% as safe havens fell out of favor.Trump Pushes Stocks HigherAfter an initial hiccup, investor warmed to the prospect of a Trump presidency and the Dow breached the 19,000 barrier for the first time in its history on Nov 22. The index has been on a bull run since the presidential election, registering the third consecutive week of gains as investors anticipate lower corporate taxation and regulations, along with higher infrastructure spending under a Trump administration.The Dow has gained 9.8% year-to-date and is likely to end 2016 nearly 9.9% higher, marking its best since 2013. Last week, the index shot up nearly 300 points, highlighting an 800-point rise since the election. (Read:4 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy as Trump Rally Rages On)Bullish Domestic DataData released over the month suggests that the economy has strengthened and is likely to pick up pace during the last quarter. According to the Commerce Department's second estimate, GDP increased by 3.2% in the third quarter. This is the fastest pace recorded in two years and the strongest year-over-year increase in nearly four.Among other notable releases this month, construction spending rebounded, the ISM manufacturing and services indexes moved higher. Retail sales surpassed expectations to increase by 0.8%. Industrial production rebounded while durable orders notched up record gains. Housing starts and home sales depicting that the housing market is in fine fettle. Finally, Fed Chair Janet Yellen indicated that chances of a near term rate hike have increased significantly.OPEC Seals Output Cut Deal, Third Quarter Earnings EncouragingConcluding months of discussions and related speculation, OPEC sealed its first ever crude production deal on Nov 30. The group of oil producing countries agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day. The move aims to trim output to 32.5 million barrels per day. The likes of ExxonMobil Corp.XOM, Chevron Corp.CVXwere the biggest gainers from this announcement. Both stocks have gained in excess of 4% over November asoil pricesmoved higher on expectations that the production bloc would finally agree on production controls.Banks were the biggest gainers from the third quarter earnings season with earnings rising nearly 13% on a yearly basis. Total earnings of 476 S&P 500 members reported in the third quarter, are up 4% from the same period last year on 2.6% higher revenues, with 73.1% beating EPS estimates and 55.5% coming ahead of revenue estimates.

The stock suffered steady losses between Nov 9and Nov 14. It has made sporadic recoveries since then, but its last spurt of gains petered out on Nov 25 and it has steadily declined since then.It is uncertain as to why the payment processor has been suffering. Revenues are garnered from transaction fees with card issuers such as JPMorganJPM, which has gained more than 16% over the month. The Zacks Financial Services Transaction Market sector has also inched upward over the month. Possibly, Visa has been hit by stock specific factors such as a litigation overhang and high client incentives. However, the stock could soon recover since its projections for 2017 are encouraging.

Forget Baker Hughes, General Electric Company (GE) Stock’s Best Buy-Outs Were a LOT Smaller;11/29/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe news dominating theGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) is undoubtedly its proposed tied-up with oil services firmBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI). Certainly, that deal is transformative and deserve plenty of attention. In the end, that will make GE a very different company - or two after it splits.Source:Anthony Quintano via FlickrIt very much warrants coverage.makeArticleAd();But while the investment world fawns over GE and BHI tying the knot, General Electric was busy making other deals - much smaller deals outside of the world of industrial manufacturing.GE is quickly becoming one of the strongest and biggest technology stocks out there. Dubbed the industrial internet or smart factories, the company is rapidly becoming one of the biggest players in the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) market.In the end, the concept of smart factories, appliances and other industrial products is really what's going to drive growth across throughout GE's future. And that includes anything that happens with Baker Hughes.GE Creates the Factory of the FutureThe last few years have been about transformation at GE. After shedding billions of dollars' worth of GE Capital and other financial assets, General Electric has gone back to its roots as major industrial manufacturer. Except, there's a hefty dose of code and programming going along with that focus on industrial manufacturing.The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the WorldDuring this whole shuffling of businesses lines, asset sales and transformation, General Electric quietly launched GE Digital. Taking tools that it used during its own internal processes, General Electric created the blueprints for the smart factory of the future. Using its newPredix platform,GE stocknow offers a whole suite of products built to combine machines and technology in one hand.Initially, the suite of products used complex sensor across various pieces of machinery - say a jet engine or conveyor belt - and then software to analyze the billions of bytes worth of data. Looking at all the data generated, it was done to help with maintenance time, operational efficiencies and other cost-saving strategies.But GE hasn't stopped there. It has a gone on an IoT buying spree designed to make PredixTHEone-stop shop for the industrial internet.While the market was focused on the BHI merger, it quietly addedShipXpressand asset performance management software firmMeridium. It also purchasedArcamandConcept Laser. It took outBit Stew- which handles efficient data integration.Wise.ioand its machine leaning AI ""natural selection"" software is now part of the GE Digital family. Industrial cyber security firmWurldtechwas added.The latest was a $915 million buyout ofServiceMax. The addition to GE Digital will allow field workers access to data, contracts and other information from anywhere on any device. It brings software as a service (SaaS) into the Predix cloud suite.None of these acquisitions were big in terms of dollar amounts, but all allow GE to really utilize everything that Predix potentially could offer. Machines and factories, thinking and learning while running more efficiently.A Monster Opportunity for General Electric StockThe real opportunity for GE comes down to making money hand over fist with Predix. Despite only being a few years old, GE is already generating plenty of revenues from the software infrastructure suite. This year,General Electric estimatesthat sales of Predix will hit $7 billion. That's a billion more than what it earned on the IoT software program during 2015.The gains are coming from major companies as well. GE just signed mega-utilityExelon Corporation(NYSE:EXC) and India'sReliance Industries Limited- which wants to use it across its energy, fertilizer, power, healthcare and telecom businesses.Longer term, Predix should grow to more than $15 billion in annual sales by the time the calendar rolls over to 2020.And there's plenty of potential for cross selling and additional revenue drivers. Just bought a new jet engine from GE Aviation? How about buying it already loaded with sensors and year's trial to our Predix software suite?That kind of cross-selling and sales pitch will even work with the various oil service products that GE will sell after it snags Baker Hughes.General Electric estimatesthat a small 1% increase in efficiency could save the oil and gas industry more than $90 billion over a 15 year period.The fact that it makes the industrial products and sells the software gives it an upper hand against other industrial IoT rivals likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO).""Techy"" GE Stock Is a Big BuyIn the end, GE is quickly becoming the industrial internet leader with its smart and small buy-outs. The Brilliant Factory and connectivity among machines and industrial processes will be a huge trend in the upcoming decades. General Electric is building on its history for the next industrial revolution, one that will be driven by coding rather than steam and coal.Betting Against PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL)     Stock Is a BIG MistakeFor investors, the sideways drift of GE stock makes it an incredible buy as its moves with gusto in the next stage of its transformation.Ultimately, GE Digital will continue to see higher revenues and the high profit margins at the unit will only serve to strengthen GE overall.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy in     2017The 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend     Stocks to Buy NowThe postForget Baker Hughes, General Electric Company (GE) Stock's Best Buy-Outs Were a LOT Smallerappeared first onInvestorPlace."

12 Facts About the Internet of Things Every Investor Should Know;11/29/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.The Internet of Things is one of those buzzwords you hear   everywhere, but nobody ever bothers to explain what it is. The   concept is expected to fuel a staggering $3 trillion market by   2020, just four short years from now.makeArticleAd();So I'm here to help. You should know these 12 facts about the   Internet of Things right now:The Internet of Things (IoT) may seem new and unfamiliar,     but it already exists and you use it all the time.ATMs started networking in an IoT-like way long before the     public internet was a thing. In the 1970s, Carnegie Mellon     University followed up with the world's firstsoda machineequipped with remote inventory monitoring. These were important     baby steps in the direction of what we now think of as the     Internet of Things.Current examples popular with consumers includewearable fitness bands, smartwatches, smart TV sets,connected cars, and remote health monitors. Whenever your gadgets are sending     data to a central processing hub, you're taking part in the     IoT.In the industrial sector, you'll find IoT systems at work     in controlling manufacturing equipment,managing energy use and production, andmonitoring airplane engine performance. Sensors collect data, while remote systems process the     massive information flows. Companies use the resulting analysis     to drive business decisions, flag equipment for maintenance,     and much more.The IoT sector is consolidating quickly. In 2014,NXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) made a massive bet on automotive computing and     the IoT with the $11.8 billion acquisition of rival Freescale     Semiconductor. Less than a year later, NXP became the target in     an even larger IoT deal, as industry giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)launched a $47 billion bidfor the Netherlands-based chipmaker.When used correctly, IoT systems can open up new business     opportunities and enhance existing processes. Some of the magic     lies in collecting the right data, and the rest springs from     running the numbers through intelligent analysis tools.The IoT requires strict security policies and powerful     shields from malicious hacking attempts. This was always     obvious, but the need for even more protection is a lesson     still being learned the hard way. In October, an automated     network attack based on insecure IoT cameras, network routers,     and digital video recorders brought down some of the biggest     online household names for several hours. IoT security is a     serious sub-market of its own with the potential to support     many billion-dollar specialists.The IoT is actually not terribly well-known yet. According     to a recent Harris Interactivepoll, only 13% of consumers in the U.K. would call themselves very     familiar with the IoT, and 48% were at least aware of the     concept. That leaves a lot of ground left to cover before the     IoT becomes as recognizable as refrigerators and bicycles.However, nuggets from the industry have made it into the     mainstream, even though they aren't always seen as examples of     the IoT. Harris found that 99% of its poll respondents were     aware of smart devices, which is pretty much the same thing     under a different name. Fitness trackers fall in this     category.Proof that it's high time everyone learned what the concept     is all about: There have been more IoT devices than people in     the world since 2008, according to global networking reports byCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) .Even so, the vast majority of connectable things are still     not properly integrated into IoT. In a whitepaper published in     2011, Cisco said that only 0.06% of all connectable devices     were networked, leaving 99.94% of devices on the sidelines.     Later Cisco reports have lifted the proportion of IoT-active     devices to roughly 0.5%, which still leaves room for a     2,000-fold explosion of smart, connected gadgets.Lucky break or inevitable progress? You be the judge: The     IoT explosion dovetails neatly with the evolution of 4G and 5G     wireless networking standards, enabling far more connected     devices than the old 2G and 3G platforms. Moreover, the IoT     eruption would not be possible withoutthe IPv6 network address standard, which in theory provides enough addresses to connect every     atom on our planet. We have officially been out of addresses     under the previous IPv4 standard since 2011, making do with     workarounds and recycled addresses.We're already on our way toward the Internet of Things   revolution, but there is a lot of growth and development left to   be done. Researchers and businesses are still figuring out how to   run this tantalizing megasystem, so stay tuned for improvements   and new investing angles.10 stocks we like better than NXP     SemiconductorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

10 Key Metrics From Cisco Systems' First Quarter;11/28/2016;"Networking giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) managed to beat revenue and earnings estimates   when it reported its fiscal first-quarter results on Nov. 16, but   the stock sank regardless. Cisco's core switching business was   weak, some of its most important growth businesses didn't grow at   all, and its guidance for the second quarter left a lot to be   desired. Here are 10 key metrics from Cisco's earnings report   that sum up the company's results.Image source: Cisco Systems.makeArticleAd();1%:Cisco's total revenue declined by 2.6% year over year during the   first quarter, but this number doesn't take into account an   important divestiture. Cisco sold its set-top box business in   2015, with the transaction closing in late November. Excluding   revenue from that business, Cisco's total revenue increased by 1%   during the first quarter.1,326:Cisco announced a significant restructuring effort in August,   with the aim of cutting costs in low-growth areas and shifting   resources into the company's major growth initiatives. Cisco   planned to eliminate 5,500 positions beginning in the first   quarter, about 7% of its global workforce, with essentially all   of the cost savings slated for reinvestment. Cisco's headcount   dropped by 1,326 during the first quarter as part of this   restructuring plan, with layoffs being partially offset by new   hires in growth businesses.-7%:Switching is Cisco's largest business, responsible for 30% of   total revenue during the first quarter. It was also the weakest   segment for Cisco, posting a 7% year-over-year revenue decline.   Cisco's switching business depends on its customers' willingness   to invest in their infrastructure, which in turn depends on the   general economic outlook. When economic uncertainty rears its   ugly head, Cisco's customers tend to slow down. CFO Kelly Kramer   pointed to campus switching as the major driver of the company's   weak results:I'd say for campus switching, which is 2/3, roughly, of our     entire switching business, which is our biggest business unit,     I'd say most of that is macro, right? It is the one area, and I     think we've talked about before. It's the one area that people     can put off doing a refresh if there are any macro concerns.     That's what we typically see any time you see any economic     pause or macro event.11%:One of the areas where Cisco is investing the cost savings from   its restructuring is security. The security business generated   $540 million of revenue during the first quarter -- up 11% year   over year -- making it the fastest-growing segment for the   company. Acquisitions are driving some of this growth, with Cisco   aiming tooffer integrated solutionsthat stand out in a fragmented security industry.48%:Security is one area of Cisco's business that's shifting toward   software -- particularly subscription software. This shift is   spreading out revenue that would have previously been recognized   upfront, hurting Cisco's headline numbers in the short run.   Kramer estimates that this transition reduced Cisco's revenue by   as much as two percentage points during the first quarter.Deferred revenue, which is revenue that has not yet been   recognized, is one way to measure the progress of Cisco's   subscription businesses. Total deferred revenue grew by 12% year   over year in the first quarter to $17 billion, with the portion   of product deferred revenue related to recurring and subscription   businesses surging 48%.-3%:The data center segment, which includes Cisco's UCS servers,   suffered a 3% year-over-year revenue decline during the first   quarter. Data center was growing at a double-digit pace not too   long ago, making this result particularly disappointing. Cisco   pointed to a market shift from blade to rack servers as well as   general macro-economic uncertainty as the main drivers behind the   decline.$3.1 billion:Despite a weak quarter in many of Cisco's key segments, the   company remained wildly profitable. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1   billion, with a gross margin of 65.2% and an operating margin of   31.6%.-2% to -4%:One reason shares of Cisco fell following the company's earnings   report was weak guidance. Excluding the divested set-top   business, Cisco expects second-quarter revenue to decline by   between 2% and 4%. The company isn't modeling any improvement in   capital expenditures from its service provider customers,   although CEO Chuck Robbins is hopeful that some headwinds will   turn into tailwinds once President-elect Trump takes office.$36.2 billion:Cisco is one of many large companies currently hoarding billions   of dollars overseas, with $36.2 billion of net cash on its   balance sheet. As it stands today, profits from international   operations can't be brought into the U.S. without that cash being   taxed at 35%. With President-elect Trump promising to enact a   repatriation tax holiday,reducing that rate to 10%, Cisco's mountain of overseas cash could finally be put to use.   The company is considering increased share buybacks, a higher   dividend payment, debt reduction, acquisitions, and strategic   investments as options if it's able to repatriate its overseas   cash.$14.4 billion:Even without using its overseas cash, Cisco has been able to buy   back a tremendous number of shares, in part by taking on debt.   The company spent $1 billion on share buybacks during the first   quarter, and it's spent a total of $97.6 billion since it began   its share buyback program. $14.4 billion remains authorized for   further share buybacks, although this number could rise if a   repatriation holiday becomes a reality.Cisco's first-quarter results may have beaten expectations,   but its core switching business is suffering from weak demand,   and its data center business has stopped growing altogether. The   shift to subscription software and macro-economic uncertainty are   teaming up to cause all sorts of problems for the company -- at   least as far as the headline numbers are concerned. Investors   will need to wait and see if the situation begins to improve in   2017.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Pure Storage and Cisco have a number of collaborations for various technologies.While the FlashArray product line addresses structured workloads, FlashBlade has been designed to tackle unstructured workloads. Such collaborations augur well for both the companies but are likely to have a minimal impact on the to-be-reported quarter's earnings.The company has also announced the availability of petabyte-scale storage utilized for mission-critical cloud IT, the next-generation of FlashArray//m. This will give its customers a wider range of products to choose from and will enhance the company's sales.The data storage industry is touted as one of the hi-tech industries to watch out for in the coming years and is reportedly on the cusp of a revolutionary change. Storage systems, based entirely on flash chips similar to the ones used in smartphones, are expected to ultimately replace high-performance disk drive systems. With cutting-edge flash storage technology that is comparatively less expensive, Pure Storage is rapidly gaining traction and is likely to record healthy top-and bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company focuses on research and development, primarily upgrading its existing products, while also developing new ones. These upgradations and innovations, however, come at a high cost. Such costs can be a drag on the company's income in the to-be-reported quarter.PURE STORAGE Price and EPS SurprisePURE STORAGE Price and EPS Surprise|PURE STORAGE QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Pure Storage will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at 0.00%.Zacks Rank:Pure Storage has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Golar LNG Ltd.GLNGhas an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and Zacks Rank #3.PVH Corp.PVHhas an Earnings ESP of +0.42% and Zacks Rank #2.

How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Should Shell Out Its Cash;11/28/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf all the news to come out the victory of President-Elect Donald J. Trump, none will be greeted more warmly than a possible tax law change forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). That's because the much-vaunted cash hoard that most praise when speaking about the tech giant might finally be dumped (at least in part) onApple stockholders.Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrCorporate taxation rates in the U.S. remain at 35%, the highest in the world. As a result, many corporations that have earned money overseas leave their profits overseas, as well. Thus, those profits do not get taxed at U.S. rates.makeArticleAd();In the case of Apple stock, that cash hoard has now reached $216 billion. Think about the sheer size of that cash pile, and what could be done with it - because right now, that cash pile is essentially worthless to AAPL.Well, maybe notworthless.Maybe not even close to that.But it does hamstring Apple from being as efficient with its capital deployment as it could.Apple Stock and the Wonders of CashI've postulated that if the tax code isn't changed, Apple would start making large acquisitions overseas. That way it could add to its top and bottom line, even if the profits would still reside overseas. It would have to make acquisitions anyway, because Tim Cook is not demonstrating that he has any vision for Apple - at least as a company - and is just a game manager.7 Stocks to Buy for the Santa Claus RallySo, let's assume there is a repatriation of some kind, either through an exemption or permanent change in the tax code. First, let's look at where Apple stock would be presently valued.The prevailing wisdom is that repatriated cash will probably be subject to a 10% to 15% tax rate, which means up to $33 billion would be taxed on AAPL, leaving net proceeds of $183 billion. Add in the $21 billion of cash here in the U.S., and Apple stock has a total of $204 billion, or about $40 per share in cash.At the current price of $111, Apple stock is thus trading at $71 per share. So the market says the business itself is worth $376 billion. On trailing 12-month net income of $45.6 billion, Apple stock is thus trading at 8.3 times net income.Normally, we'd look at a company's earnings growth rate and make a judgment if the stock is fairly valued based on whether it is trading at a reasonable multiple compared to its growth rate. There's a small problem with that, though.Apple's net income fell in fiscal 2016 by about 16%. Analysts project the five-year EPS to increase at 8% annually. However, that's earnings per share, not net income. And EPS growth is being juiced because of stock buybacks, even if not by much.As long as Apple continues to be driven by iPhone sales, which account for some two-thirds of revenue, and Tim Cook doesn't show us what his vision of the company is going forward, I'm not inclined to offer AAPL stock the kind of premium it used to command.Still, at 8.3 times net income, Apple stock isn't expensive, either.I think the repatriation of that money is what tips the scales to a buy for me.How Apple Should Spend That CashMost people think that Apple would increase its stock buyback. I'm not so sure about that. It wouldcontinueto buy back shares, but probably do so at a reasonable pace, and certainly not all at once.Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Showing Signs     of HopeI think AAPL would be wise to prudently raise its dividend, as well. Right now, Apple stock only yields 2.1%. Given how much cash it has, how much cash flow it generates, and that it would like to remain competitive with bonds, Apple could increase the dividend into the 4% range without breaking a sweat. That would only require an additional $10 billion per year, and Apple stock suddenly would have the (price) support of the income crowd.Also, I think it's clear that Apple needs to make some acquisitions to build itself out. If that seems obvious, I agree. But remember: AAPL is not nearly as acquisition-happy as others in the tech space, such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO). It should purchase companies that are obviously synergistic with its current form, and also branch into new areas that are capable of extending the Apple experience.Finally, I believe Apple should set up a $10 billion content studio. Yes,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and others are more entrenched. But the dividends of content in this era will be paid for a long time to come.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the   forthcomingLiberty   Portfolio stock newsletter.

Verizon Retail Index Sees High eCommerce Holiday Traffic;11/28/2016;"According to a recent report by U.S. telecom behemothVerizon Communications Inc.VZEnterprise Solutions' third annual Verizon Retail Index, the average daily eCommerce traffic volumes to U.S.-based retailers on Black Friday were up 9% year over year while peak ecommerce volumes were 39% higher than 2015 levels, indicating increased consumer engagement through digital platforms. Moreover, Thanksgiving (Nov 24) drove eCommerce traffic by 10% year over year while peak eCommerce volumes were 22% higher than 2015 levels.Verizon is known for its diversified business model, which covers varied fields like communications, technology, wireless industry, Internet of Things (IoT) along with the media video and digital platform. Toward this end, the telco recently reported heavy eCommerce (Electronic commerce) and mCommerce (Mobilecommerce) traffic on Black Friday (Nov 25), courtesy of the promotional offers.The weekend before Thanksgiving also witnessed a moderate 15% hike in daily eCommerce traffic volumes to U.S.-based retailers compared to 2015 levels. Peak eCommerce volumes showed a 35% year-over-year rise, implying encouraging response by consumers to the deals offered by retailers. However, mCommerce traffic was down 2% year over year while peak mCommerce volumes were up 2% from a year ago.The Verizon Retail Index specializes in consumer ecommerce traffic during the holiday shopping season. The index also tracks eCommerce traffic across Verizon's broadband networks. The index also monitors network traffic throughout the holiday shopping season, including events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.The next edition of the Verizon Retail Index will reveal digital shopping activity figures for the Nov 26-27 weekend and is scheduled to be released today. The escalation in eCommerce and mCommerce traffic on Black Friday implies that the telco's efforts to expand and strengthen its digital-video network have paid off. Verizon has also been engaged in a number of digital ventures.Recent EventsThis September, Verizon entered into a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc.QCOM, to develop its IoT platform, ThingSpace. Meanwhile, Verizon's rival AT&T Inc.Tpartnered with Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOto launch an all-in-one IoT Starter Kit. Notably, these telecom companies are looking for alternative sources of revenue to offset the decline in their legacy businesses like fixed-line services.VERIZON COMM PriceVERIZON COMM Price|VERIZON COMM QuoteVerizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Down to Strong Sell on Weak Q1;11/25/2016;"On Nov 24, 2016, Zacks Investment Research downgraded network security solutions provider,Palo Alto Networks Inc.PANWto a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Why the Downgrade?Palo Alto Networks' stock has been on a downtrend ever since it reported dismal first-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Shares slipped 13.3% since the announcement. In fact, the company's stock price has been declining for a while now, as is evident from its year-to-date plunge of 20.7%.Coming to the first-quarter results, the company's adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, was 58 cents. The figure was significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents and the loss of 36 cents in the year-ago quarter.Though Palo Alto Networks' revenues of $398.1 million surged 34% year over year, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $400 million.The company also reported an adjusted operating loss of $38.7 million, which increased from a loss of $21.8 million suffered a year ago. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 38.7% year over year) impacted operating results.The company also provided a tepid second-quarter revenue guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $426 million to $432 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $432 million.We believe that all the aforementioned factors led to downward revisions in Palo Alto Networks' estimates. Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 increased from a loss of $1.10 per share to loss of $1.12.Also, Palo Alto Networks has been witnessing an increase in operating expenses due to stepped-up investments in research and development, and marketing strategies, which have been offsetting the benefit of higher revenues.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Apple, Cisco, Intel, NVIDIA and Facebook;11/23/2016;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - November 23, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeApple(Nasdaq:AAPL-Free Report),Cisco(Nasdaq:CSCO-Free Report),Intel(Nasdaq:INTC-Free Report),NVIDIA(Nasdaq:NVDA-Free Report) andFacebook(Nasdaq:FB-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Tech Stock Roundup: iPhones, A.I., Self-Driving Cars and     MoreLast week was an exciting one with some rumors about Apple's (Nasdaq:AAPL-Free Report) iPhone manufacturing in the U.S., Cisco's (Nasdaq:CSCO-Free Report) earnings report, Intel's (Nasdaq:INTC-Free Report) first AI Day plus lots more.iPhone Manufacturing In The U.S.In June this year, Apple requested its iPhone assemblers Pegatron and Foxconn to evaluate the feasibility of making the devices in the U.S. While Pegatron refused outright on cost considerations, Foxconn has decided to do the job. The study is likely to show that the cost increase, skill mismatch and supply chain problems (the supply chain is largely in Asia) would make this cost prohibitive.This would raise iPhone prices for consumers/squeeze Apple's margins. But the study will help Apple negotiate with the government, which might agree to fund skill development and/or subsidize U.S.-made phones. If not, Apple could introduce a luxury line of iPhones manufactured in the U.S. and try to set off the super normal profits on those with the increased cost of phones carrying the government import duty.Note that Apple is not the only smartphone maker saddled with the problem. So if all smartphones get more expensive, Apple's market share may not be affected.Cisco Earnings ReportCisco's first quarter 2017 resultstopped the Zacks Consensus Estimateon both the top and bottom lines but the guidance disappointed. Switching remains a sore point for Cisco in a market increasingly favoring SDN networks and leveraging the cloud. So it's not surprising that this segment declined 7%. The company had greater success in security where both advanced threat (up 100%) and web security (up 60%) were strong.Intel A.I. DayAt its first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Day in San Francisco last week, Intel announced bold plans to target the deep learning segment that is currently dominated by NVIDIA (Nasdaq:NVDA-Free Report) GPUs. Intel silicon is also in the mix, but it doesn't take part in the real training work. Artificial intelligence comprises two main operations: training and inference with training being the more compute intensive. Inference can be handled by Intel CPUs, Xilinx/Altera FPGAs, NVIDIA GPUs, ASICs like Google TPU and in some cases, DSPs. Now Intel is planning to enter the training side very aggressively and hopefully it can stick with the timeline it has set.Based on its acquisition of startup Nervana last year, Intel is building a new Xeon processor with Nervana integration. FPGAs are generally used as accelerators and we don't know yet if Intel will be using the FPGA technology it got through Nervana or Altera, which it also picked up recently. At any rate, Intel promises to deliver 100X the training speed current GPUs offer within three years, which industry expert Patrick Moorhead says is aggressive. Intel expects the chips to start testing in mid-2017 and ship by year end.Fake News DramaFacebook (Nasdaq:FB-Free Report) and Google are being pressured by mainstream media (MSM) for influencing the public in favor of Trump. As ridiculous as this sounds, there is a lot of print devoted to trying to prove them guilty.Google recently started employing artificial intelligence to support its search results that have until now been solely algorithm-based. But as luck would have it, there was a brief period during which time 70news.wordpress.com took the top position, fielding incorrect data on the number of votes earned by Clinton and Trump and claiming to have obtained the information from Twitter.The information was reportedly correct elsewhere on Google but this was enough to earn Google accusations for making money out of ""fake news."" So Google has said in a statement, ""Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property."" It is hoped that the inability to generate revenue from fake news will make it harder to produce it.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said that 99% of the news sites posting on Facebook were authentic and that it didn't want to get into the position of arbiter of truth. ""We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,"" said the Facebook statement (the company has now added the fake news part to pacify parties). Facebook also gave an assurance that it would continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Ericsson (ERIC) to Provide Media Delivery Services for SBS;11/23/2016;"Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ)ERICinked an exclusive contract to provide media delivery services for Australian public service broadcaster, Special Broadcasting Service (""SBS""), fortifying its position as a leading provider of broadcast and media services in Australia and globally.Per the contract, Ericsson will leverage its broadcast and media services hub in London to cumulate, prepare and deliver content from multiple content owners and distributors globally. This content will be format ready for transmission and will be delivered directly to SBS's headquarters in Sydney.Further, Ericsson will also provide Quality Control and deliver full technical metadata, in accordance with SBS's technical and editorial specifications.This deal will enable SBS to transition from a manual delivery process to a digitised practice, thus making its content aggregation process more efficient and streamlined. It will also lend SBS the flexibility and agility required to cater to the dynamic demands of managing media assets.As a leading global provider of broadcast and media services, Ericsson has worked with world's most famous broadcasters, platforms and content producers, including BBC, HBO, 20th Century Fox, Liberty Global, Sky, Bonnier Group, TV5 Monde and France 24.In April this year, Ericsson signed a multi-year access services contract with SBS to provide both live and file-based captions for SBS TV. Ericsson is one of the leading providers of closed captioning services in the world, and boasts a strong presence in Australia, the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.S.ERICSSON LM ADR Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseERICSSON LM ADR Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|ERICSSON LM ADR QuoteWe believe that the new contract will not only help strengthen Ericsson's live captioning business in Australia, but also boost its brand value in the global wireless equipment market.Of late, Ericsson has been grappling with slumping demand in Russia and Brazil, and accelerating negative industry trends have further compounded its problems. Further, the company is also facing stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co. and Nokia Corp.NOK. To combat such critical industry concerns, Ericsson recently struck a partnership with Cisco Systems Inc.CSCO, to boost its product line up and sell more complete networks. The company expects that the deal would generate $1 billion or more in annual sales for each company by 2018.Whether the growth and cost-streamlining efforts of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company will help it beat industry-wide demand blues, remains to be seen.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the same space is Harris CorporationHRS, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Tech Stock Roundup: iPhones, A.I., Self-Driving Cars and More;11/22/2016;"Last week was an exciting one with some rumors about Apple'sAAPLiPhone manufacturing in the U.S., Cisco'sCSCOearnings report, Intel'sINTCfirst AI Day plus lots more.iPhone Manufacturing In The U.S.In June this year, Apple requested its iPhone assemblers Pegatron and Foxconn to evaluate the feasibility of making the devices in the U.S. While Pegatron refused outright on cost considerations, Foxconn has decided to do the job. The study is likely to show that the cost increase, skill mismatch and supply chain problems (the supply chain is largely in Asia) would make this cost prohibitive.This would raise iPhone prices for consumers/squeeze Apple's margins. But the study will help Apple negotiate with the government, which might agree to fund skill development and/or subsidize U.S.-made phones. If not, Apple could introduce a luxury line of iPhones manufactured in the U.S. and try to set off the super normal profits on those with the increased cost of phones carrying the government import duty.Note that Apple is not the only smartphone maker saddled with the problem. So if all smartphones get more expensive, Apple's market share may not be affected.Cisco Earnings ReportCisco's first quarter 2017 resultstopped the Zacks Consensus Estimateon both the top and bottom lines but the guidance disappointed. Switching remains a sore point for Cisco in a market increasingly favoring SDN networks and leveraging the cloud. So it's not surprising that this segment declined 7%. The company had greater success in security where both advanced threat (up 100%) and web security (up 60%) were strong.Intel A.I. DayAt its first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Day in San Francisco last week, Intel announced bold plans to target the deep learning segment that is currently dominated by NVIDIANVDAGPUs. Intel silicon is also in the mix, but it doesn't take part in the real training work. Artificial intelligence comprises two main operations: training and inference with training being the more compute intensive. Inference can be handled by Intel CPUs, Xilinx/Altera FPGAs, NVIDIA GPUs, ASICs like Google TPU and in some cases, DSPs. Now Intel is planning to enter the training side very aggressively and hopefully it can stick with the timeline it has set.Based on its acquisition of startup Nervana last year, Intel is building a new Xeon processor with Nervana integration. FPGAs are generally used as accelerators and we don't know yet if Intel will be using the FPGA technology it got through Nervana or Altera, which it also picked up recently. At any rate, Intel promises to deliver 100X the training speed current GPUs offer within three years, which industry expert Patrick Moorhead says is aggressive. Intel expects the chips to start testing in mid-2017 and ship by year end.Fake News DramaFacebookFBand Google are being pressured by mainstream media (MSM) for influencing the public in favor of Trump. As ridiculous as this sounds, there is a lot of print devoted to trying to prove them guilty.Google recently started employing artificial intelligence to support its search results that have until now been solely algorithm-based. But as luck would have it, there was a brief period during which time 70news.wordpress.com took the top position, fielding incorrect data on the number of votes earned by Clinton and Trump and claiming to have obtained the information from Twitter.The information was reportedly correct elsewhere on Google but this was enough to earn Google accusations for making money out of ""fake news."" So Google has said in a statement, ""Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property."" It is hoped that the inability to generate revenue from fake news will make it harder to produce it.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said that 99% of the news sites posting on Facebook were authentic and that it didn't want to get into the position of arbiter of truth. ""We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,"" said the Facebook statement (the company has now added the fake news part to pacify parties). Facebook also gave an assurance that it would continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.CompanyLast  1 MonthYTDAAPL+1.48%+16.83%FB-1.68%-2.33%GOOGL+0.49%+7.00%MSFT+2.25%+18.14%INTC+0.98%+16.85%CSCO-3.85%+13.64%AMZN+2.85%+7.08%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateIntel-Disney Drone Show: Intel, in collaboration with Walt Disney Imagineering, will be putting up a light show for guests at Disney Springs - the shopping, dining and entertainment district of Walt Disney World Resort. The show will feature 300 Intel Shooting Star drones for the first time in the U.S. These are tiny drones made of styrofoam and plastics, weighing 280 grams and bearing LED lights that can create over 4 billion color combinations and easily be programmed for any animation from a single computer. At the show, the drones will operate with holiday music.Microsoft and the Wind: MicrosoftMSFThas agreed to buy 237 megawatts of capacity from Allianz Risk Transfer AG's Bloom Wind Project in Kansas and Black Hills Corp.'s Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. Microsoft expects that its data centers will get about 44% of their electricity from wind, solar and hydropower sources this year and 50% in two years. The company already has deals for 20 megawatts of solar power and 285 megawatts of wind, according to the blog post.Goldman Sachs Upgrades Microsoft: GS analysts Heather Bellini and Heath Terry have upgraded Microsoft to Buy based on its current and prospective growth in cloud computing. The analysts believe that Microsoft with its increased focus on the cloud will benefit from the growth in public cloud spending, which they estimate will go from $32 billion this year to $137 billion in 2020.Pixel Resellers Taken to Task: Google showed how much a technology company providing basic digital services controls our digital existence. Last week, some people that had bought Pixel phones online for resale by a New Hampshire dealer at a markup had their accounts frozen for violation of terms of service. Since no one really reads these terms of service, the measures came as such a shocker. Google, which attempts to make the devices available to everyone at the same price, has since restored the services (Gmail, online photos and other) with a warning.Alibaba-backed Logistics Firm's U.S. IPO: Best Logistics, in which AlibabaBABAowns a 22% stake, is reportedly looking for a U.S. IPO early next year. The company is valued at $3 billion based on its latest funding round, in which Alibaba, Fosun International Ltd., SoftBank China Venture Capital, Alibaba's own logistics unit, Cainiao Network, and the World Bank's private-sector investment arm, International Finance Corp participated.Legal/RegulatoryRussians Fear Apple Call Logs: Russian provider of iPhone hacking tools, Elcomsoft says that Apple maintains a call log of users' phone calls and other details in its iCloud for up to four months. Apple likely does this to help sync calls across devices, but the storage of private information without explicit consent is problematic.Moreover, in its data access guide for law enforcement, Apple says that available iCloud information includes email logs and content, text messages, photos, documents, contacts, calendars, bookmarks and iOS device backups but doesn't mention call logs. While all iCloud data is encrypted once it's on the server and in transit, Apple keeps the keys for iCloud accounts in its U.S. data centers.Amazon Sues Counterfeit Sellers: Following repeated complaints from different parties including Apple, Amazon is taking action against companies acting as counterfeiters. Last week, Amazon filed a couple of cases against sellers of training equipment (originally developed and patented by Fitness Anywhere and sold by third-parties) and against infringers of patented technology for forklift equipment.These actions aren't easy because first, the patent holder has to be established, second, new counterfeiters crop up all the time and third, Amazon, given its size has millions of sellers, so it's hard to track any one seller. So these actions are encouraging. Amazon's Chinese rival Alibaba also faces the same problem resulting in the alienation of some brands.New Technology/ProductsApple Considering AR Device: Bloomberg reports that Apple may be experimenting with a Google's Glass-like AR (augmented reality) device, for which it has spoken to suppliers and ordered a small quantity of related components. But while Google, Samsung, Facebook and others have focused more on VR (virtual reality), Apple, like Microsoft with its Hololens, seems to be more interested in AR. In any event, the device is not expected to launch until 2018 at the earliest.WhatsApp Video Calling: Facebook has launched fully-encrypted free video calling for all WhatsApp users across the world. While this obviously sweetens personal communications, it also makes the app more attractive for business users. The recently-talked about job posting feature does the same thing. Facebook had promised to look at monetizing the app once the user base reached critical mass and the company seems to be doing just that.Amazon Family Plan: Similar to Apple, Spotify and others, Amazon has launched a family plan that charges $14.99 a month for up to six users. Prime members aren't getting a concession on this one, although they do have the option of choosing an annual family membership for $149, which then brings down the monthly cost to $12.42.While other music services offer unique experiences, feature sets, personalized playlists and recommendations, etc, Amazon's service comes with Alexa so you can just ask her to do your bidding in choosing tracks albums, genres, or whatever else you may be in the mood for.Amazon Expands Home Services: Amazon nearly doubled its home services areas with 20 new additions last week. The company offers more than 1200 services such as lawn care, plumbing, electric work, home cleaning and more through this offering. Services are also offered when a customer buys some item from Amazon and needs someone to install it. TV wall-mounting, house cleaning and furniture assembly are reportedly the most popular services at present.M&A and CollaborationsIntel Invests in Self-Driving Cars: At the Los Angeles Auto Show last Tuesday, Intel said that it is putting in $250 million to support the development of self driving and other technology (connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, artificial intelligence, safety and security) for cars all over the world. Intel has said that it is currently involved in 30 vehicle programs, but that number would swell to 49 by 2020. Its order book is already pretty huge at a billion dollars, but this is just the beginning.Intel and Google Get Closer: Google and Intel are deepening their relationship with the goal of pushing their respective technologies in the cloud. While Google needs to wrest share versus Amazon and Microsoft, Intel would like to make inroads into the deep learning segment that NVIDIA dominates. The two companies have now decided to go for both product integration and joint marketing to push these efforts, especially among big cloud customers. They have announced that the collaboration will include container management, machine learning, IoT and security.Microsoft-NVIDIA Tie for A.I.: The companies have announced a collaborative effort to promote Microsoft's A.I. solution through its Azure cloud computing platform. The Microsoft solution is based on GPUs from NVIDIA, the leading provider in the machine learning space. Indicating the considerable prospects, the companies say that A.I. has application across a broad number of industries including healthcare, life sciences, energy, financial services and automotive.Microsoft Ties with Elon Musk A.I. Company: Tesla's Elon Musk has agreed to use Microsoft's Azure to develop AI technology for its self driving cars. The Musk-backed startup OpenAI will use NVIDIA-powered Azure N-Series Virtual Machines, which will be available from December. OpenAI was formed in December last year by Musk and Y-Combinator President Sam Altman and others with the goal of ascertaining that self-driving technology remains open and free for all, possibly also as a reaction to Google's dominance in smartphones.Amazon-Hyundai: Hyundai's connected car Blue Link technology is now getting Alexa integration, so users can get their cars warmed up and ready before they step into them. Or they can ask Alexa to lock the doors as they carry heavy grocery bags into the house.Google AMD: Google is one company that keeps all its options open. So on the one hand, it uses GPUs from NVIDIA, the current market leader (by far), on the other, it is now using NVIDIA rival AMD's GPUs. And if that isn't enough, it's also into deepening its relationship with Intel for its Nervana-based, non GPU technology, which is yet to make it into the market. So come 2017, training deep neural networks is going to be a very interesting business indeed.Confidential: Zacks' Best Investment IdeasWould you like to see a hand-picked ""all-star"" selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks' trading and investing services?

"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Q1 Loss Widens; Revenues Miss";11/22/2016;"makeZacksArticleAd();Palo Alto Networks Inc.PANWreported lower-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results.Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted loss per share (excluding amortization and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), on a proportionate tax basis, of 58 cents. The figure was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents. The company had suffered a loss of 36 cents in the year-ago quarter.Quarter DetailsThough Palo Alto Networks' revenues of $398.1 million surged 34% year over year, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $400 million. The year-over-year improvement in revenues was primarily backed by strength in the network security market, a strong product lineup and deal wins.Product revenues jumped 11% to $163.8 million. The company saw a 57% surge in subscription and support revenues ($234.3 million). SaaS-based subscription revenues climbed 65% from the year-ago period. Support revenues increased 49% year over year.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 33% and represented 70% of total revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) also went up 32%, accounting for 18% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 47% and brought in the balance.Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base supported quarterly revenues. Moreover, billings jumped 33% year over year to $516.9 million during the quarter.Palo Alto Networks' gross margin increased 120 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 74.6%, primarily backed by growth in both product recurring subscription and support gross margins.The company reported an adjusted operating loss of $38.7 million, which increased from a loss of $21.8 million suffered a year ago. GAAP operating loss during the quarter came in at $49.9 million compared with a loss of $32 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Higher operating expenses (up approximately 38.7% year over year) also impacted operating results.The company's adjusted net loss was $51.9 million, wider than a loss of $31.6 million reported last year. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $61.8 million compared with a loss of $39.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Palo Alto Networks exited the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.390 billion compared with $1.285 billion in the previous quarter.Receivables were $346.5 million compared with $348.7 million in the last quarter. Palo Alto Networks' balance sheet does not have any long-term debt. The company reported cash flow from operations of $203.3 million during the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $182.4 million during the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 340k shares worth $50 million.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Palo Alto Networks expects revenues in the range of $426 million to $432 million, up 27% to 29% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $438 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share within 61 cents to 63 cents (excluding stock-based compensation expenses).The company continues to expect fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.80. Revenues for the same period are expected to grow in the range of 30% to 31%.PALO ALTO NETWK Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePALO ALTO NETWK Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|PALO ALTO NETWK QuoteOur TakePalo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided a tepid forthcoming revenue guidance.Nonetheless, revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base are the other positives. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward.The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure. Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOand Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.CHKPremain concerns.Currently, Palo Alto Networks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Why Marathon Petroleum, Arista Networks, and Headwaters Jumped Today;11/21/2016;"The stock market climbed to new record highs on Monday,   spurred by big gains in the oil patch and ongoing optimism about   the financial industry. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all   reached new all-time high levels, along with the small-cap   Russell 2000 and mid-cap S&P Midcap 400 indexes. Some stocks   did even better, andMarathon Petroleum(NYSE: MPC) ,Arista Networks(NYSE: ANET) , andHeadwaters(NYSE: HW) were some of the best performers today. Below, we'll   look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so   well.Image source: Marathon Petroleum.Marathon gets some activist attentionMarathon Petroleum jumped 9% after activist investor Paul   Singer and his Elliott Management private equity company asked   the energy company to break itself into three different pieces.   Elliott Management, which has about a 4% stake in Marathon   Petroleum, sent a letter to the board of directors suggesting   that a strategic review might lead the company to split out its   retailing business into one entity, its refinery assets into   another, and its pipeline and storage assets into a third   separately traded investment vehicle. Marathon Petroleum issued a   statement responding to the letter, saying that it has already   taken action along the same lines that Singer's company has   suggested but remains open to engaging with shareholders. Elliott   has a history of successfully persuading companies to take   actions to boost their share prices, and investors are hopeful   that its efforts can lead to strong returns for Marathon as   well.makeArticleAd();Arista gets some trade reliefArista Networks finished up more than 7% after the networking   equipment company got a vote of approval from U.S. customs   authorities. Arista has been working to find ways around an order   from the International Trade Commission, which prevented it from   importing products that rivalCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) had argued infringed on its intellectual property.   However, Arista always believed that it could offer alternative   designs that accomplished the same purpose while avoiding any   infringement issues, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection   apparently agree that the design changes effectively limit the   scope of the import ban. Further litigation is possible, but for   now, investors are pleased that the solution appears to be taking   shape.Headwaters agrees to a mergerFinally, Headwaters jumped 17%. The building products company   said Sunday that Australian peerBoralhad agreed to buy Headwaters in a cash deal worth about $2.6   billion, with investors in Headwaters receiving $24.25 per share   in cash. Boral believes that the deal will be completed around   mid-2017, and Boral CEO Mike Kane said that Headwaters'   businesses ""are highly complementary with Boral's existing U.S.   operations."" Some question whether an expected commercial   building boom in the U.S. will actually come to pass, but   shareholders in Headwaters are benefiting from the current   optimism.10 stocks we like better than Marathon     PetroleumWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Now;11/21/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe odds of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December are only going up, but even if the central bank pulls the trigger,dividend stockswill always remain in style.Source:401(K) 2012 via Flickr (Modified)True, they could come under price pressure because they compete with bonds for investor dollars, but they typically don't stay down for long. It's not like we're looking at anything but the most minimal raise anyway.makeArticleAd();So while interest rates will go up, they'll still be pitifully low. That's where superior dividend stocks come in. Names with solid track records of stable and in some rising dividends are under consideration for an equity income portfolio. If they can deliver above-average price appreciation too, so much the better.Combine the two, and you've got a market-beating total return engine.We searched theS&P 500to find these types of stocks. Mind you, the benchmark index has a subpar dividend of its own, at just 2.2%. It's easy to find stocks with higher yields, but then, a high yield can be a warning sign for a dividend payer. The highest-paying names in the S&P 500 all have issues that the market is rightly worried about.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017So we looked for the happy middle ground, and that's how we arrived at the following list of dividend stocks to buy now. They're blue-chip picks with strong income streams, good (but not dangerously great) yields and market-beating price potential.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #10: Wells Fargo (WFC)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)WFC Dividend Yield:2.9%If there's a downside to the big price surge inWells Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC) stock since the presidential election, it's that the dividend has fallen below 3% for new money. Just don't forget that if a new administration removes a number of financial regulations, WFC will have more room to hike its payout.Either way, WFC's share price has recovered a good chunk of the selloff following its phony accounts scandal. Moreover, despite its issues, Wells Fargo remains a high-quality stock with heavy exposure to the U.S. economy. It's the nation's largest mortgage lender, after all.That also means Wells is not dependent on Wall Street activities like investment banking and trading. That helps tamp down volatility in earnings.Shares are closing in on breakeven for the year-to-date. Even withnew restrictions placed on the bank, overwhelmingly positive sentiment on the financial sector should allow WFC to turn positive for 2016 soon.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #9: Merck (MRK)Source:Ryan via Wikimedia (Modified)MRK Dividend Yield:3%Merck & Co., Inc.(NYSE:MRK) is on fire this year - at least for a stodgy ol' pharmaceutical giant.MRK shares are up 18% for the year-to-date even after cooling off from all-time highs. Add in the dividend, and the total return easily tops 20%.The price surge has tamped down the yield for new money, but MRK stock still looks to offer a market-beating combination of price appreciation and payouts.The pharma outfit is facing some patent losses, but new drugs and acquisitions should make up for them. Lung-cancer drug Keytruda is a burgeoning blockbuster. Moreover, Merck has five drugs that currently are being reviewed by regulatory agencies, as well as 25 late-stage and 11 mid-stage programs.10 Pharma Stocks to Buy Under President     TrumpIf that's not enough to give investors confidence, Morningstar notes that Merck holds a strong position in immuno-oncology, a diverse portfolio and the ability to further cut costs.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #8: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)CSCO Dividend Yield:3.4%Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) is a blue-chip dividend machine, but it offers more than just a steady stream of payouts. CSCO has reconfigured its business to cloud-based services, an area that promises tremendous growth.True, it's a long, painful and slow transition to cloud-based services and away from hardware. The arrow hasn't always been pointed up, but Cisco has been regularly topping Wall Street's earnings and revenue targets. And, as always, the market loves cost cuts, which CSCO continues to deliver.Cisco has been a total-return machine so far this year, with price appreciation of nearly 11% on top of the healthy dividend.Shares tumbled with the rest of the tech sector after the presidential election, andlousy guidancein its most recent earnings report hasn't helped, either. But as a result, CSCO's yield has swollen, and shares have reached a better entry point.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #7: International Paper (IP)Source:Billy Hathorn via Wikimedia (Modified)IP Dividend Yield:3.8%It's as old-line economy as you can get, but paper products have a bright future in our increasingly digital economy. As the largest containerboard maker in the world,International Paper Co(NYSE:IP) is poised to benefit.You can thank e-commerce for that. IP supplies 50% ofAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) need for cardboard boxes. Between AMZN and the rest of the e-commerce industry, the need for such products is in a secular uptrend.The Top 10 Mutual Funds to Buy for 2017Shares have shrugged off the pressures of slowing demand in China and a strong dollar to put up a year-to-date gain of 28%. And even then, IP stock still fetches only 12 times forward earnings. That's not out of line for a company with a projected long-term compound annual growth rate of 7% and a dividend yield near 4%.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #6: Altria (MO)Source:Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)MO Dividend Yield:3.8%Say what you will about tobacco companies, but they're an attractive place to be if you're looking for equity income.An active one likeAltria Group Inc(NYSE:MO) is even more so.MO doubled down on its sin-stock status after buying a big stake inAnheuser-Busch InBev SA NV (ADR)(NYSE:BUD), but it's the juiced-up buyback program that makes MO look good for the foreseeable future.BUD's merger withSABMiller plc(OTCMKTS:SBMRF) gave MO a 9.6% stake in that company - and more than $5 billion in cash. That allowed MO to raise its share repurchase commitment to $3 billion from $1 billion through the second quarter of 2018.A generous and dependable dividend combined with this financial engineering makes for a powerful total-return combination.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #5: Chevron (CVX)Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)CVX Dividend Yield:3.9%Like most of the rest of the energy sector,Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) has been hit by lowoil prices. Naturally, investors are nervous about cash flows and the stability of dividend payments.They needn't worry. Oil prices appear to have stabilized. CVX delivered Street-beating quarterly results last time around, driven by cost cuts that have more room to run. Capital spending and operating and administrative expenses have been reduced by more than $10 billion from the first nine months of 2015.Besides, as an integrated energy major, Chevron's downstream business offers a bit of a hedge against weakness in crude oil. Oil prices are cyclical - even if the cycles can take a painfully long time to turn.7 Top Energy Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThat's fine. Dividend stocks work best over the long haul anyway.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #4: General Motors (GM)Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)GM Dividend Yield:4.6%The market is rightly worried aboutGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) hitting the peak of the latest car-buying cycle, but it's overdoing its concerns.For one thing, even if U.S. car sales flatten out they're going to do so at historically high levels.And yet GM stock has been discounted for disaster. It really comes down to valuation with this name. General Motors has a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 5.8. As oneInvestorPlacecommenter recently noted of GM stock, a P/E that low bakes in a lot of stupid.As noted above, even if we are at a cyclical peak, no one expects demand to drive off a cliff. If U.S. sales cool off, they will be doing so from record levels. Perhaps that's why analysts still expect GM to have a compound annual growth rate of more than 10%.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #3: Verizon (VZ)Source:Via FlickrVZ Dividend Yield:4.8%The utilities and telecommunications sectors are bastions of dividend stocks, but utilities look a bit pricey these days. Telcos, while getting stretched, are less so. That's why No. 1 wireless carrierVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is worth a closer look.As much as traditional telecommunications is a poky business, VZ is making some interesting moves. Most famously it recently acquired the core properties ofYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) to drive new revenue streams and position itself for the future. And a little further back, Verizon acquiredAOL.You might scoff at Verizon picking up has-been Internet properties, but they actually provide VZ with potential growth in digital content and advertising technology.9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in     the Long RunSure, Verizon is boring, but it's supposed to be. And it's actually being pretty aggressive when it comes to digital media. So not only do you enjoy nearly 5% in yield, but you have the potential for decent price appreciation going forward.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #2: Ford (F)Source:Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)F Dividend Yield:5.1%The basic investment thesis onFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) is the same as it is for GM. The market is bearing down too hard on share price for an imminent deceleration in vehicle demand.That makes Ford a cheap stock. Even better, it just got cheaper for a stupid reason.Investors fled the name for fear that it made an enemy in President-elect Donald Trump. (Note to sellers: There was no feud to begin with.)F stock is having a dismal year - it's down more than 16% - but that only highlights the value proposition and raises the dividend yield for new investors.At just 7 times forward earnings, Ford stock would appear to have baked in a lot of bad news already. As long as the dividend is safe - and there's reason to believe it is - a patient investor will enjoy a generous dividend stream now and price appreciation later.Top S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy #1: AT&T (T)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrT Dividend Yield:5.2%If you're looking at the telecom sector for dividend stocks to buy now, you've got to go withAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T). It's the king of blue-chip dividend payers. You can't find another mega-cap that throws off dividends like AT&T.Like its No. 1 competitor, T is dealing with the telco growth conundrum by branching out. That's why it acquiredDirecTV. And now, AT&T is going back to the M&A well.Yes, T struck a deal to buyTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). If federal regulators block the deal, they might be doing shareholders a favor. They probably won't, though, which means you have to have a little faith in T's digital mobile strategy. At least it's not standing pat while VZ chugs ahead.7 Fantastic Stocks That No One Talks AboutEither way, with gushers of free cash flow, the dividend is safe. Price appreciation has been adequate too as long as you think of this name as kind of like a bond in drag.As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.The postThe 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Nowappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Things Barrick Gold Corporation Wants You to Know About Its Strategic Goals;11/21/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Barrick Gold(NYSE: ABX) is in the midst of a major transformation. The gold   miner is moving away from a focus on growing gold production to   become a company that grows value. As part of that shift, the   company set three strategic goals to pursue over the next five   years. With three-quarters of this year in the books, here's   what President Kelvin Dushnisky had to say about its progress   during the company's recent quarterly conference call.makeArticleAd();Building new partnershipsBarrick Gold's first strategic goal is:[To have a] profound understanding of and commitment to the     idea that in the twenty-first century, our core business is     building partnerships of real depth and trust with host     governments, local communities, NGOs, indigenous people, and     others.The company took an interesting step toward that goal in the   third quarter with Dushnisky noting that it announced a   ""strategic collaboration withCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO)  ... for the digital reinvention of our   business."" He said that the first step of this collaboration   would be ""a flagship digital operation at Cortez."" This   partnership will entail embedding digital technology throughout   the mine so that the company, for example, can get real-time   operational data to enhance decision making. In addition to that,   the company plans to automate equipment to increase productivity,   which when combined with predictive algorithms can improve   precision and speed.Barrick will also work with Cisco to transform its entire   mining business in the future, with a focus on bringing digital   technology to all of its mines. This partnership will help the   company unlock value, which will grow its free cash flow per   share while at the same time reducing its environmental impact,   allowing it to be more transparent with its local partners. In   essence, this is the first step of many as the company works to   not only take its business into the 21st century, but build   new partnerships to create value for all stakeholders.Improving marginsBarrick's second goal is:[T]o produce industry-leading margins by operating in a way     that is gold-price agnostic. Whatever the gold price, we are     constantly pushing ourselves to reduce our costs by being the     first for productivity and efficiency.The company needs to take a series of smaller steps to become   gold-price agnostic. For 2016, that meant setting a target ""to be   free cash flow breakeven at a gold price of $1,000 per ounce   after paying a dividend,"" according to Dushnisky. However, on the   call, he noted that the company was ""on track to achieve that   goal with free cash flow breakeven of less than $1,000 per ounce""   as of the end of the quarter. Because it was ahead of schedule,   the company took full advantage of highergold pricesduring the third quarter and generated $674 million in free cash   flow, which allowed it to repay nearly $500 million of debt.Image source: Getty Images.Strengthening the portfolioBarrick's final goal is:Superior portfolio management. We measure our production in     quality, not quantity. While we produce fewer ounces than we     have in recent years, we generate significantly more free cash     flow per share; indeed, in 2015 we produced free cash flow for     the first time in four years. We will prioritize growing free     cash flow over growing ounces. And we will always assess     existing and new opportunities, both internal and external,     with that goal in mind.To meet that aim in the near term, Dushnisky noted that the   company ""further strengthened our capital allocation process, and   we continue to maintain a 15% hurdle rate for new investments   using a $1,200 an ounce gold price."" This high bar means Barrick   will only invest in its best opportunities going forward. It also   suggests that the company will spend less capital since it will   no longer sanction projects that don't meet the higher hurdle   rate, which will allow it to generate more free cash flow. That   gives the company more flexibility to push toward its   philosophical goal of being debt free while also returning more   capital to shareholders.Investor takeawayBarrick Gold's management team is transitioning the company to   a new way of thinking. That means using technology to reduce   costs, which will improve its margins and cash flow. Furthermore,   the company no longer wants to be the biggest gold company by   volume but instead become the most profitable producer. Barrick   believes that this aim will enable it to create value for all   stakeholders in the years to come.10 stocks we like better than Barrick GoldWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

In the updated research report issued today, the Zacks analyst covering the stock highlights Cisco's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market.

Is Cisco Stock Worth Holding Through Its Transition?;11/21/2016;"Image source: Cisco.Cisco Systems Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) is certainly facing new hurdles, including   intensified pressure from competitors, among which is the company   that often stokes fear in shareholders of rival companies:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . However, after reporting mixed fiscal 2017   first-quarter earnings,Cisco stockstill looks like it could be a strong contender for a spot in a   long-term oriented portfolio, even in the face of its challenging   transition.Why the stock is down nowCisco reported fiscal 2017 Q1 earnings for the period ended   Oct. 29 on Nov. 16, including sales of $12.4 billion (excluding   certain product categories that were sold in 2015), up 1% year   over year. GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 were 4% lower than a   year ago, but in line with expectations.makeArticleAd();While the sales growth was modest, the company performed   reasonably well in the quarter compared to expectations. What led   to the 5% sell-off after earnings were released seems to be the   weaker-than-expected guidance for Q2. Because of weak orders from   service providers, which Cisco management blames on uncertainty   in the economy and other macro-level trends, revenue (excluding   the same segments as above) is expected to be 2% to 4% lower than   a year ago, with EPS (GAAP) expected to be in the range of   $0.42 to $0.47, which would be a 32% to 24% decline year over   year.Cisco's transformation in focusCisco Kelly Kramer said in the release:We executed well in Q1, delivering profitable growth, and     saw strong adoption of our subscription-based and software     offerings as we transition our business to a more recurring     revenue model. We will invest in key growth areas and continue     to focus on delivering shareholder value.Cisco seeks to become less reliant on hardware. Image     source: Cisco.The transition Kramer is speaking to is Cisco's attempt to   break out of the hardware and other traditional product   categories such as Switching and Data Center, two segments   that had declining sales in the quarter. Instead, Cisco believes   other areas of the business will lead future growth.There were highlights in Cisco's earnings, such as NGN   routing, Cisco's second largest segment, which grew 6%; security,   which increased 11%; and deferred revenue, which accounts for   subscription products and grew 12% year over year. Gross   margin expanded healthily during the quarter, up 190 basis points   to 64.7%, thanks mostly to improved productivity.Profit margin still fell because of heavier costs, part of   which is due to recent acquisitions. To help further its   transformation, Cisco has been busy buying up software and   cloud-computing companies in the last quarter, including:CloudLock:Provides protection from the cloud to the network to the     endpoint, enhances Cisco's security portfolio and ""Security     Everywhere"" strategy, and will help deliver more     cloud-based subscription services.ContainerX:Focuses on developing enterprise-class container     management technology that works across a range of     platforms.Heroik Labs:Does business under the name Worklife, provides software     to improve meeting productivity.Is Cisco stock worth holding?There's one very large elephant in the room that Cisco   shareholders (and those of any business, really) need to watch   out for: Amazon's next moves. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has   made incredible gains in the cloud-computing services   market in a very short period. Bearish Cisco analysts   believe Amazon can offer equal or better cloud service for a   lower cost, and that the hardware used to build Amazon's   infrastructure is brand-name, so there's little chance for Cisco   to gain on the hardware side.Still, Cisco's numbers are already providing encouragement   that some of its newer growth segments, such as security, could   become bigger parts of the company and provide a way for Cisco to   remain very relevant in a market focused on cloud computing and   the Internet of Things (IoT). These segments are still a   relatively small part of the company's total sales, but the   transition focus does seem to be paying off in those areas.Cisco also has an incredibly large cash stockpile that could   soon be put to use in new product development, more acquisitions,   and increased share buybacks and dividends. Similar toApple, which has made headlines for what it might do with its more   than $200 billion, most of Cisco's massive $71 billion in cash is   outside of the United States while the company waits for more   favorable tax conditions to repatriate it into the U.S.   President-elect Donald Trump has signaled for lower corporate tax   rates and possibly a tax holiday to get these companies to bring   their funds to the U.S., which we could see happen as early as   2017.Cisco shares are currently trading at just 13 times   estimated 2017 earnings estimates, and that also includes an   attractive 3.5% yield that Cisco management has signaled is   likely to grow. For all of those reasons, it appears worthwhile   to hold on to Cisco stock and see how this transition turns out.Forget the 2016 election: 10 stocks we like better than   Cisco SystemsDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Wal-Mart, Cisco, Home Depot Beat on Earnings, Disney Disappoints;11/18/2016;"The Dow racked up major gains over the week following increasingly positive sentiment over a Trump presidency. Financials strengthened as chances of a rate in December increased substantially. Meanwhile, tech stocks trended downward for some time before returning to their winning ways.Oil prices, and subsequently the sector's stocks, continued to be guided on inventories data and chances of an output cut. Fed Chair Yellen indicated that a rate hike was around the corner.Last Week's PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.2% last Friday as investors continued to cheer Donald Trump's win in the Presidential election. The Dow registered gains for the fifth consecutive session and finished at an all-time record high for the second straight day. Investors continued to speculate that the Trump Presidency will boost economic growth and inflation through new policies including higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts.Such expectations raised chances of rate hike in the near-term. Separately, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer also indicated that the central bank has started to believe that inflation rate in the U.S. is on the verge of picking up significantly, which may result in a rate hike. This had a positive impact on financial stocks.The index gained around 5.4% over last week. This was the Dow's best weekly performance since Dec 2011. A surprise election result led investors to speculate that a Trump Presidency may boost the U.S. economy. Most of last week's gains came on the back of a rally in healthcare and financial stocks. While Clinton's defeat played the main role in boosting healthcare stocks, rising expectations of a rate hike helped financial stocks surge.The DowThisWeekThe index gained 0.1% on Monday. The Dow's winning streak extended to a sixth consecutive session to finish and the index finished at another all-time record high.  Shares of Apple Inc.AAPLdeclined 2.5%. Shares of FANG stocks also declined. These losses dragged the technology sector down, which eventually had a negative impact on the benchmarks.However, markets managed to offset most of the losses from tech stocks on the back of a continuing rally in financials. Expectations that inflation will rise in the near future have heightened, which in turn has raised chances of a rate hike next month. These factors continued to have a positive impact on financials.The index increased 0.3% on Tuesday with the Dow hitting an all time high for the fourth straight session on the back of strong rebound in energy and technology stocks. Renewed investor focus on investing in tech stocks offset concerns that Trump's policies may have a negative impact on the sector. Apple Inc. and the FANG stocks increased significantly. Moreover, speculations resurfaced that OPEC members may come up with a fruitful solution to the output glut in their upcoming meeting, scheduled for Nov 30.This had a positive impact onoil prices, which eventually boosted energy sector. Retail sales jumped 0.8% in October following a revised 1% increase in previous month, also higher than the consensus estimate of 0.6% rise. These were the best two-month gains registered in more than two yearsThe Dow slipped on Wednesday, losing 0.3%, as financial stocks failed to hold on to their winning streak. Overvaluation concerns may be one of the factors behind yesterday's decline. In addition to retreat in financial stocks, decline in energy stocks weighed on the major benchmarks and led the Dow to end in the red for the first time in the last eight sessions.The energy sector finished in negative territory after jump in the U.S. crude inventories offset rising speculations of an output cut. Alexander Novak, Russia's Energy Minister hinted that major oil producers may enter into an agreement to reduce oil production at the Nov 30 meeting. However, oil prices ended in the red despite rising output cut chances after the EIA reported that crude stockpiles increased 5.3 million barrels for the week ending Nov 11.The index rebounded on Thursday, gaining 0.2% to finish at a new record high. Most of the day's gains came on the back of encouraging domestic economic data and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's testimony, which indicated that a rate hike after next month's policy meeting is definitely on the table. She also added that inflation is gradually progressing towards the Fed's 2% target and ""near-term risks to the outlook were roughly balanced.""Separately, CPI rose at a pace of 0.4% last month, its highest increase in the past six months, on the back of significant increase in gasoline prices. Housing starts soared 25.5% from September to 1,323,000, hitting their highest level since Aug 2007.ComponentsMovingthe IndexWal-Mart Stores Inc.WMTreported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings (excluding non-cash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China and tax impact of that gain) of 98 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents by 2.1%.Total revenue of the retailer came in at $118.2 billion (including membership and other income). The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $118.5 billion by 0.3% but increased 0.7% year over year. Currency depleted sales by approximately $2.14 billion.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Wal-Mart expects U.S. comp sales growth in the range of 1%−1.5% for the 13-week period ending Jan 27, 2017. For fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart now expects its adjusted earnings in the range of $4.20−$4.35 per share, compared with $4.15−$4.35 projected earlier. (Read:Wal-Mart (WMT) Q3 Earnings Beat on Comps, Revenues Miss)The Home Depot Inc.HDposted fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.60 per share, which jumped 18.5% from $1.35 in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58.Net sales advanced 6.1% to $23,154 million from $21,819 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, the top-line marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23,036 million.Zacks Rank #3 rated Home Depot reiterated its sales and comps guidance, while it raised its earnings forecasts for fiscal 2016. The company continues to project sales growth of 6.3%. Home Depot now envisions diluted earnings per share to grow about 15.9% year over year compared with $6.33 earned in fiscal 2015. (Read:Home Depot (HD) Stock Up on Q3 Earnings and Sales Beat)Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOreported first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 55 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings decreased 3.3% from the year-ago quarter to 59 cents. Cisco has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Although revenues declined 2.6% year over year to $12.35 billion, the figure was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.34 billion. Revenues include SP Video CPE Business for both the periods. Excluding SP Video CPE Business, revenues increased 1% from the year-ago quarter.For the second-quarter of fiscal 2017, revenues (excluding the SP Video CPE Business) are expected to decline in the range of 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range 55-57 cents per share. The stock holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company's earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.10 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 and declining 8.3% year over year.  Revenues declined 3% year over year to $13,142 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,469 million. Disney has a Zacks Rank #3.However, Chief Executive Robert Iger remained optimistic about the company's future. Iger is bullish on ESPN's future, which has come under a lot of pressure as the Pay TV landscape continues to alter owing to the migration of subscribers to online TV.

4 Things Cisco's Management Wants You to Know;11/18/2016;"Image source: Cisco Systems.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) beat analyst estimates when it reported its fiscal   first-quarter results on Nov. 16, but there was plenty of bad   news for investors to consider. Collaboration and data center,   two growth segments, posted revenue declines, and switching,   Cisco's core business, reported a decline, as well. Revenue   during the second quarter is expected to contract by 2% to 4%,   adjusted for divestitures, a disappointing outlook that sent   shares of the networking hardware giant tumbling.makeArticleAd();The details beyond the headline numbers are important. Cisco's   earnings conference call was packed with valuable pieces of data   that can help investors fully understand the company's results.   Here are four key quotes from management that stood out, taken   from the transcript provided byThomson Reuters.Security continues to shineOne of Cisco's major growth initiatives is security, a   business that has been growing at a double-digit rate in recent   quarters. Because the security business is shifting toward   subscriptions, the 11% revenue growth Cisco reported during the   first quarter doesn't fully reflect how much progress the company   is making. CEO Chuck Robbins went into the details:Let me review a few areas of our business where our     innovation is driving momentum. First, security. Our security     revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth-consecutive quarter of     double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based     recurring business, resulting in deferred revenue growth of     39%.That big jump in deferred revenue suggests that Cisco's   security business will continue growing at a rapid pace going   forward. Robbins also pointed out that Cisco is the only company   with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annual run   rate and growing at a double-digit pace. Acquisitions are driving   some of this growth, but Cisco's strategy of offering integrated   security solutions appears to be working.Explaining the weak guidanceCisco's second-quarter guidance fell well short of   expectations, with analysts expecting the company to grow sales.   Robbins discussed the one major factor behind the weak   guidance:I think if you just look at our guidance, let me be clear.     It's predominantly the SP weakness and the overall CapEx     challenges that we've seen in SP. That business is largely     account driven. You can assume that we have done an account by     account by account analysis in that space and understand what's     going on there. Right now I think there are a unique set of     characteristics, particularly in the SP space. You have the     overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which I think has     led to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by     the analysts, as well as you have political and regulatory     environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the U.S. and     around the world.Product orders from service providers slumped 12% year over   year, while every other customer group posted flat or positive   order growth. Macro-economic uncertainty, something we've heard   from Cisco before, is one component, as is the uncertainty   created by the U.S. election. Robbins was optimistic that   President-elect Trump would enact business-friendly policies,   potentially reversing some of these headwinds. But the company is   not modeling any improvement, thus the weak guidance.The shift to subscriptionsSecurity isn't the only segment where a shift to subscription   and recurring revenue is hurting near-term results. When asked by   an analyst about the exact impact of this shift, CFO Kelly Kramer   laid out the details:I'd say it's a couple points for sure impact on our growth     and it's a combination of -- its largely been historically     collaboration and security and Meraki, but we are continuing to     add on our core platform with our Cisco ONE suite, like I     mentioned last quarter, which that is now being recognized     ratable where a year ago, we would have recognized that as a     perpetual license sale. For example, just using Cisco ONE as an     example in this quarter, it would have been a point and a half     just on that if we had recognized it perpetually like we had a     year ago.Moving toward a recurring revenue model should make revenue   more predictable, but for now, it's hurting Cisco's top-line   numbers. Revenue that was once recognized all at once is being   spread out over time. In the near term, this shift makes Cisco's   results look worse than they really are. However, even adjusting   for the negative impact of the subscription shift, Cisco's   guidance still calls for a sales decline.RepatriationWith President-elect Donald Trump promising to allow companies   holding cash overseas to bring it back into the country at a 10%   tax rate, Cisco's mountain of overseas cash may finally be put to   good use. Kramer outlined the company's priorities:Just high level, as you could imagine, we have many, many     scenarios of what we would do when repatriation comes, which is     a combination of obviously we would ring fence in our debt and     then we would have a blend of actions we can certainly take     with our dividend, as well as our share buyback, as well as     leading flexibility for us to be able to do M&A and     strategic investments. It'd be a combination of all those     things. Obviously, we listen very closely to our shareholders     and how we want to do that and we recognize it will certainly     give us a lot more flexibility.At the end of the first quarter, Cisco had about $71 billion   of cash and investments on its balance sheet, along with $34.8   billion of debt. Borrowing costs are low for Cisco, with the   company paying just $198 million in interest during the first   quarter. But some debt reduction is likely.I suspect a major boost to the buyback would be in the cards   in the event of repatriation. Cisco may also raise its dividend   more than it would have otherwise, or implement a special   one-time dividend. This is all speculation at this point, but I   think it's safe to say that the company would return some of that   cash to shareholders.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Top Research Reports for Cisco, Amgen & NextEra Energy;11/18/2016;"Friday, November 18 2016Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amgen (AMGN), Cisco (CSCO) and NextEra Energy (NEE).Buy-ratedCiscohas lost ground following the mixed quarterly report, but the stock is still up more than 10% in the year-to-date period and continues to lead the broader technology space. In the updated research report issued today, the Zacks analyst covering the stock highlights Cisco's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Pure Storage, salesforce.com and IBM will help Cisco to gain significant traction in the data center, cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) market in the long haul. (You canread the full research report onCiscohere>>)Amgenshares have struggled this year, but it has come back following the election as fears of restrictive pricing and regulatory strictures have eased. The analyst points to Amgen's impressive quarterly results, its portfolio of blockbuster drugs, the prospect for efficiency gains from the restructuring plan and track record of returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the coming quarters. However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. (You canread the full research report onAmgenhere>>)NextEra Energy's shares have increased by more than 10% year-to-date but have struggled over the last quarter. NextEra Energy's reported mixed third-quarter earnings. However, the analyst likes NextEra Energy's investment in renewable generation which should boost its performance over the long haul. Favorable economic conditions in its service territories will drive demand for utility services. Strategic acquisition and asset divestment bode well for NextEra Energy. On the flip side, NextEra Energy's nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulations. Also, concerns related to commodity price fluctuations might deter its growth to some extent.

First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Stock Can Fight Through the Pain;11/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese are certainly stormy times in the solar sector. In what seems like a repeat of events that occurred just a few years ago, the clouds are blocking any sunshine from reaching stocks in the sector. And those clouds have affected everyone form smaller panel players to industry stalwarts likeFirst Solar, Inc.(NASDAQ:FSLR). For FSLR stock, the pain is hitting deep.Source:U.S. Department of the Interior via FlickrAfter reporting abysmal earnings, the solar panel and grid-scale project firm is going back to the drawing board and restructuring itself to survive the near-term pain.makeArticleAd();While the crash in its shares yesterday hurt (and it's continuing to fall today), in the long run that restructuring might bare some serious fruit.As I said last time, FSLR stock is very much a long-term play.The Clouds Get Darker at First SolarNo one likes waking up to a 13% decline after hours, only to see an additional 11% decline when the bell finally opens. Such was the case yesterday when First Solar shareholders fired-up their brokerage accounts yesterday morning. Overnight, the solar firm managed to fuel some fears that all is not right with the sector. Today, shares are still tumbling downward with a 4% drop in early morning trading.7 Stocks to Buy From the Scrap HeapOver the last year, solar stocks likeSunPower Corporation(NASDAQ:SPWR) andTrina Solar Limited (ADR)(NYSE:TSL) have been trending down thanks to an old foe. A sheer glut of panels.We've been down this road before as the solar industry often falls victim to supply gluts. Rather an abundance of new panels hitting the market, demand is really the cause for the supply glut. China's demand of new solar panels and projects has fallen by the wayside. That has caused panel prices to crater.For FSLR stock, the price drop in solar modules has already begun to hurt its bottom line. During its latest earnings release, First Solar saw its revenues decline by 45% and it was forced to walk away from some money losing, utility scale solar projects. That's a big deal as those grid-scale projects are really its bread-n-butter. FSLR was also forced to cut its guidance for the rest of 2016 and 2017.But apparently, it wasn't enough.Thanks to the continued glut of panels and recent unfavorable operating environment - *cough* Trump's presidential win - First Solar has taken the chainsaw to its business and has announced a massive restructuring effort to ""kick the can"" until the sun shines again.Losses at FSLR for a Whole YearFirst Solar has been a superstar in terms of panel efficiency. As a result, its modules capture more sun and are better at turning that sunshine into electricity. The problem is they are more expensive to buy. With prices so darn low for regular panels, it doesn't make much sense for solar project developers to use FSLR's better panels. As a result, First Solar announced plans to produce cheaper panels that aren't as good.But the firm has hit a road block. The glut has gotten worse and one of the cheaper designs is now too expensive.FLSR has now abandoned plans for the Series 5 product and will bring its production of its Series 6 modules to the market earlier. However, that is still a full year away. In the meantime, its Series 4 modules will continue production and slowly phase out until the newer cheaper panels are on the market.What does it really mean? Somebig time charges and losses for the firm. FSLR now expects a loss per share of $2 to $4 this year. Just a few weeks ago, it had guided to profits of $3.75 to $3.90 per share. Those losses come from cutting 1,200 jobs and realizing pretax restructuring charges of $500 million to $700 million during the fourth quarter.More importantly, the mid-term outlook isn't good either as First Solar now estimates that it will see lower revenues and panel shipments during all of 2017. It didn't give any profit estimates for the new year.Keep in mind, FSLR already lowered its outlook when it reported earnings last time.Look Longer-Term for FSLR StockThe continued panel price decline and major charges at First Solar are certainly troubling. Not only for FSLR stock, but the entire industry. And for some pure-panel players, it could be their death knell. But for First Solar, this could be a real opportunity for investors.It's Time to Rethink How We Value Cisco     Systems, Inc. (CSCO) StockThe key to remember is that First Solar's main focus is those grid-scale projects. The bulk of FSLR's customer base is still utilities and major power providers - not mom 'n' pop rooftop firms likeSolarCity Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY). A major utility has a different set of mandates. And thanks to regulation and tax advantages, when they commit to a project, it usually gets done. That's where FSLR stock will shine long-term.The roll-out of its newer cheaper panels will only help push more power producers into First Solar's hands. The charges hurt today - very much so - but they also show that FSLR is willing it do what it takes to keep its competitive advantage.The Bottom Line: If you have a longer-term timeline, the drop in First Solar shares might be a great time to snag some and put them away for a while. Solar has always been a long-term game and the recent moves by FSLR are insuring that it it'll be around to play that game in the next decade.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Pharma Stocks Under President     Trump7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Due for a     ReckoningThe postFirst Solar, Inc.

Not bad for a beaten-down, left-for-dead semiconductor stock.The recovery has been sufficient in turning the sluggish 200-day moving average higher, confirming the turnabout in MU's long-term trend.Thursday's breakout completed a two-month base which digested the stellar gains accumulated during the summer rally.

That price void should act as a magnet for MU shares moving forward.Source: OptionsAnalytixFirst up is the retest of the gap area at $20.70 (roughly 5% higher from here). Any kind of probe into the gap area has the potential to fully fill the gap, which would carry Micron back to $23.70.The MU Stock Option TradeMicron's soaring share price has dampened demand for options, and that means prices have been driven into the ground. That's bad news for option sellers relying on juicy premiums for profits, but good news for option buyers looking for a directional bet. If you want a low-risk trade positioned to thrive if MU stock continues trending, buy the Jan $18 calls for around $1.90.The risk is limited to the initial $1.90 debit and will be lost if Micron sits below $18 at expiration.

Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Looks Even Better With Urban Strategy;11/18/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhileWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT) andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) are considered the ""Coke and Pepsi"" of modern discount retail, they're not nearly as similar as most people think.Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)For one thing, WMT generates much more volume per quarter, about $120 billion, than TGT generates in a year, about $70 billion.makeArticleAd();Target's results are also choppier. It had a great Christmas last year, but a massive theft of customer data by hackers in 2013 hampered results for years and resulted in a turnover of the executive suite.The history is also different. Walmart started as a discount chain, while TGT is descended from the old Dayton's department stores, which were eventually merged with Marshall Field's and spun out in 2004. Target is generally more corporate than WMT, which is still run in the image of entrepreneurial founder Sam Walton.Target stock is riskier, but its smaller size means it can change strategies quickly. The company has changed its strategy lately, under new CEO Brian Cornell, and investors need to understand the changes before buying Target stock.TGT Is Becoming a City MouseEarly in 2016, the big story at TGT was thatit was beating WMT in e-commerce. It integrated its online store with in-store pick-ups last Christmas, growing online sales by 30%, and was planning $2.5 billion of investments in technology by 2017.7 Stocks to Buy From the Scrap HeapAnalysts were initially skeptical of it's move, and early results were poor, but last Christmas made analysts believers of Target stock and the company is now considered an e-commerce leader.Cornell's latest move is even bigger. He's going to make TGT the City Mouse to Walmart's Country Mouse.Target plans to open hundreds of small-format stores, mostly in large cities, reshaping the company's image and real estate footprint in the process.WMT CEO Doug McMillon had tried something similar starting in 2014, opening Neighborhood Markets and planning Walmart Express stores built around gas stations, but Walmart abandoned the plan this year, closing 269 outlets.The difference between the two plans lies in where the small stores are, and who they are aiming at.While the Walmart Neighborhood Markets were in suburbs, and represented in-fill between larger Walmart SuperCenters, the new TGT stores arein the center of cities, and in college towns, highlighted by a 45,000 square-foot unit in Tribeca, in lower Manhattan.While the Neighborhood Markets were also smaller, cookie-cutter versions of WMT's larger outlets, heavy on the groceries and mostly self-service, the new Target stores are customized to their neighborhoods and the company is investing heavily in its supply chain to get the specific goods each location needs.Bottom Line on Target StockIt's the planned adaptation to local tastes - and the back-end supply chain needed to fulfill those needs - that is going to determine whether this plan succeeds.In setting his sights on urban life, Cornell is going after a growth market and taking advantage of TGT's smaller size, relative to Walmart. The question is whether the chain's discount image can handle the shift, and whether it can deliver prices that are below those of other retailers in urban cores.It's Time to Rethink How We Value Cisco     Systems, Inc. (CSCO) StockIf Cornell can make this work then Target stock becomes a real threat to stores likeWhole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) on the grocery side andMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) on the retail end. These high-end merchants have focused on urban markets to maintain margins, and TGT is threatening to cut them.Another question is whether urban consumers will flock to a store called Target. Cornell thinks they will, because many urban newcomers are families with small children, not the singles and young marrieds who moved intown in previous decades.Such consumers may be looking for bargains. If they are, and if Target can integrate its e-commerce efforts neatly into such stores, the company's stock could be in for big gains.If you're willing to take a bigger risk for a possibly great reward, look to Target. If you're mainly looking for yield and relative safety, you're a WMT shopper.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

As for major ETF losers, the volatileDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT) sank by 4% asgold pricesslipped.Meanwhile,Best Buy(NYSE: BBY) andCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) posted significant swings following their   quarterly earnings announcements.Best BuyBest Buy shares rallied 14% after the company revealed   improving business trends heading into the biggest retailing   quarter of the year. Comparable-store sales increased 2%, for a   decent acceleration over the prior quarter's 1% uptick. The   retailer also managed much faster earnings growth as operating   profit margin jumped to 4% of sales from 3% last year. ""We are   pleased to report today growth on both our top and bottom lines,""   CEO Hubert Joly said in a press release.Image source: Getty Images.Innovation in the consumer-electronics space helped push   customer traffic higher, with leading product categories   including home theater, mobile phones, and wearable tech. Gains   in those areas were offset by a continued slump in video   gaming.Best Buy held the line on prices, and that discipline helped   gross profit margin expand to 24.7% of sales, from 24.1%. The   company soundly beat its own earnings guidance, logging non-GAAP   profit of $0.62 per share compared to the $0.45 per share it   forecast back in August.Looking ahead, Joly and his team see innovation continuing to   drive customers to its stores over the holidays. Sales growth is   likely to stayuncomfortably close to zero, though. Still, executives aim to hit that steady figure while   significantly scaling back on promotions. If it works, the   strategy should result in non-GAAP earnings of as high as $3.30   per share for the full year, or 19% higher than fiscal 2016.CiscoCisco was the biggest loser on the Dow, dropping 5% following   the tech giant'sfiscal first-quarter results. As expected, revenue ticked up by 1%, and gross margin was 64%   for a slight increase over the prior quarter.Image source: Getty Images.Management highlighted strong growth in the routing, security,   and service segments that together offset declines in major   categories, including switches and collaboration hardware. The   U.S. geography was Cisco's weakest as clients continued to defer   their major IT spending projects. ""We had a good quarter despite   a challenging global business environment and we performed well   in our priority areas,"" CEO Chuck Robbins said.Cisco sees those challenges continuing into the current   quarter, which is typically when many large clients set their   budget for the coming calendar year. Robbins and his team see   revenue declining by as much as 4% as gross margin ticks down to   63% of sales.These figures translate into non-GAAPearnings of $0.56 per share, below consensus estimates of   $0.59 per share.

Cisco (CSCO) Tops Q1 Earnings and Revenues, Lowers View;11/17/2016;"Cisco Systems Inc.CSCOreported first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 55 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings decreased 3.3% from the year-ago quarter to 59 cents.makeArticleAd();Although revenues declined 2.6% year over year to $12.35 billion, the figure was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.34 billion. Revenues include SP Video CPE Business for both the periods. Excluding SP Video CPE Business, revenues increased 1% from the year-ago quarter.However, shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trading following disappointing second-quarter guidance from the management primarily due to weak order trend from service providers (down 12% in the first-quarter). Notably, service providers comprise roughly 25% of the company's business.Segment Revenue DetailsOn a year-over-year basis, products (75.3% of total revenue) were down 5.5% to $9.30 billion, while services (24.7%) increased 7.5% to $3.05 billion.FindTheCompany | GraphiqUnder the Product category, Switching, Collaboration, Data Center, Wireless and Service provider video decreased 7%, 3%, 3%, 2%, and 2%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. However, this decrease was partially offset by strong performance from NGN Routing, Security and other segments which increased 6%, 11% and 88%, respectively.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas and EMEA declined 4% and 3%, respectively. APJC revenues increased 6% from the year-ago quarter. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICs plus Mexico up 2%.In terms of customer segments enterprise grew 5%, commercial grew 1%, public sector was flat and service provider dropped 12%.During the reported quarter, Cisco completed the acquisition ContainerX (Read More: Cisco to Acquire ContainerX for Container Management). Further, the company bought CloudLock and Heroik Labs.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 190 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 64.7% in the reported quarter. The expansion was primarily driven by higher product gross margin (up 250 bps), which increased due to continued productivity improvements.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues increased 100 bps to 36.1% primarily owing to increase in all the expense line items. As percentage of revenues, Research and development (R&D), Sales and Marketing (S&M) and General and Administrative (G&A) expenses increased 20 bps, 30 bps and 20 bps, respectively.CISCO SYSTEMS Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseCISCO SYSTEMS Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|CISCO SYSTEMS QuoteNevertheless, operating margin expanded 90 bps to 28.6% due to higher gross margin base.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCisco exited the fiscal quarter with cash and investments balance of almost $71 billion compared with $65.8 billion in the prior quarter. Cash & cash equivalents and investments available in the U.S. at the end of quarter were $10.4 billion.Total debt (short-term and long-term) was $34.8 billion, significantly up from $28.6 billion at the end of previous quarter.Net cash flow from operating activities decreased to $2.73 billion from $3.82 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Further, free cash flow declined almost $1.10 billion in the reported quarter.During the quarter, Cisco paid cash dividend worth $1.3 billion and repurchased approximately 32 million shares for $1 billion.As of Oct 29, 2016, Cisco had repurchased 4.6 billion shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $97.6 billion since the inception of the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount under this program is approximately $14.4 billion.GuidanceFor the second-quarter of fiscal 2017, revenues (excluding the SP Video CPE Business) are expected to decline in the range of 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range 55-57 cents per share.Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 63-64%, while operating margin is anticipated between 29% and 30% for the quarter.Our TakeThe modest first-quarter results and the disappointing guidance will weigh on the stock price in the near term. Intensifying competition from several smaller players, slowing order growth from service providers and challenges in the emerging markets are the primary headwinds.Nonetheless, we believe Cisco's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market are promising. In this regard, Cisco's partnership with Pure StoragePSTGrelated to Flashstck will boost the company's position in the data center market.Additionally, the company's partnerships with the likes of salesforce.comCRMand IBMIBMwill help it to gain significant traction in the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) market space going ahead.Further, the collaboration with cloud-based Evergent Technologies will bolster Cisco's presence in the over-the-top (OTT) video market.Moreover, continued share buyback and dividend hikes are positive in our view.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCisco carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3 Tech Stocks That Belong in Every Portfolio;11/17/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Volatility and high-flying valuations are tech stock   characteristics that cause some investors to avoid the sector   entirely. However, that's painting with too broad a brush -- and   a good way to miss out on some of the best opportunities on the   market. While the dangers inherent to buying stocks priced for   high growth and the threat of disruption in the broader space   make some tech companies a poor fit for portfolios that aim to   minimize risk, the sector also hosts standouts that any investor   should consider.makeArticleAd();With the goal of identifying tech stocks that deserve a spot   in any portfolio, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to   spotlight their pick for a top stock in the space. Here's whyThe Priceline Group(NASDAQ: PCLN) ,Check Point Software Technologies(NASDAQ: CHKP) , andCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO)  made the list.Ready for takeoffBrian Feroldi: For years I believed that The Priceline Group was   just another online travel site, so I couldn't figure out why its   stock was always hitting new highs. That all changed in 2010,   when I was finally educated about the business. I've since come   to believe that this tech stock that belongs in every investor's   portfolio.The Priceline Group has transformed itself into a market   darling thanks to itstop-notch management team. The company has a long history of making smart acquisitions   that have helped to power its revenue and profits higher for   years on end.While you're probably already familiar with several of its   brands -- think Kayak, Priceline, OpenTable, RentalCars, and more   -- the majority of the company's profits come from Booking.com,   the leader in the European hotel market. The company spent years   to build out a large network of hotels, which have attractive   customers who value selection. In turn, that has encouraged more   hotels to sign up, creating an unbeatable competitive   advantage.Looking ahead, Priceline looks well positioned to take   advantage of the shift toward online travel. It also boasts a   handful of partnerships that are likely to greatly benefit it   over the long term. Since the global online travel market is   estimated to be worth $492 billion (and growing), Icontinue to believethat this company's future looks bright.Value, income, and growth potentialKeith Noonan: With a wide range of investment styles and needs out there,   picking a stock that looks to be a good fit for all investors is   no easy task, but Cisco Systems has the makings of a top choice,   thanks to its balanced components of value, growth potential, and   returned income.Trading at roughly 13 times forward earnings estimates, the   stock is priced far below both the network hardware industry   multiple of 25 and the S&P 500's average forward earnings   multiple of 18,  and it's backed by a rock-solid   balance sheet. As of the fiscal year ended July 30, Cisco had   $65.8 billion in cash and short-term assets while holding $28.6   billion in long-term debt, and the company is adding to its   balance each quarter thanks to strong cash flow.The company posted $12.42 billion in free cash flow in its   last fiscal year, up roughly 20% over a five-year period, and   strong cash generation is helping the company distribute and grow   its dividend while also adding to the books. With an annualized   payout of $1.04 and roughly 5 billion shares outstanding, the   cost of distributing the company's dividend represents just   around 42% of last year's free cash flow -- indicating room for   continued growth. Even if near-term payout increases are small,   its yield already sits at a chunky 3.3%.As the leader in the network hardware space, Cisco looks to   benefit from the dramatic increase in data load and connected   devices brought on by the Internet of Things. It's also building   out its device connectivity platform and is poised to be a big   player in the development of crucial IoT technologies and   services. The company's core routing and switching business is   under pressure, which is a key factor in the company's   inexpensive valuation, but the stock has lots of room to run if   IoT and other emerging business ventures continue to play out   favorably.A data and security stalwartTim Brugger: Unlike many of its peers in the data security space, Check   Point doesn't ""wow"" investors each quarter with 30% or 40%   top-line growth. So why does Check Point stock belong in every   tech stock portfolio? Because even the most aggressive long-term   investor should consider a consistently reliable, continuously   profitable stock, and that's exactly what founder and CEO Gil   Shwed provides, quarter in, quarter out.Check Point once again delivered in its recently announced   third quarter. Despite reporting ""only"" a 6% jump in   revenue, earnings per share climbed 7% including one-time   expenses, and an impressive 9% after factoring in costs. The   increase in EPS over and above revenue gains is an ongoing theme   of Check Point's and speaks to Shwed's strict expense management   philosophy. That's something its unprofitable peers can't seem to   grasp.Check Point's strategic objective of building recurring   revenue stream via its data center, cloud, and enterprise   security solutions is also gaining momentum. Last quarter, Check   Point's product and license revenue grew just 1% to $136.9   million. But Check Point's subscription sales soared 24% compared   with a year-ago to $98.58 million.The better news is that Check Point's initiative to increase   its consistently reliable revenue streams will continue to rise   after its 15% jump in deferred revenue to $889 million last   quarter. Check Point lacks the flash of its competitors, but in   an industry expected to generate $1 trillion over the next five   years, it's one  of the few data-security providers   investors can rely on to deliver bottom-line results, each and   every quarter.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Tech ETFs to Watch Post Cisco Q1 Results;11/17/2016;"After the closing bell on Wednesday, one of the tech primes - Cisco SystemsCSCO- came up with its fiscal first-quarter results. Both the top and the bottom line topped out estimates but provided a weak revenue guidance. The tepid outlook dampened investors' mood, sending shares of Cisco tumbling as much as 5.4% in aftermarket hours.makeArticleAd();Cisco Q1 Results in FocusEarnings of 55 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues rose 1% year over year to $12.35 billion and were slightly ahead of our estimate of $12.34 billion. Though this represents the twelfth consecutive quarter of a revenue beat, growth has slowed significantly since fiscal 2010 when Cisco reported an 11% increase.The networking leader continued to struggle with its traditional business of high-end switches and routers due to sluggish demand. Though the company is ramping up its wireless and security businesses to offset this weakness, the new business is yet to pay off and is growing slowly. As a result, Cisco expects revenues to decline 2-4% year over year for the ongoing fiscal second quarter. The projection fell short of the Zacks expectation of a 1.3% increase (read:Pain Ahead for Cyber Security ETFs as Q3 Unfolds?).Earnings per share are expected in the range of 55-57 cents, the midpoint of which is much above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents.Should You Buy Cisco?Currently, Cisco has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a VGM Style Score of B and boasts a solid Industry Rank in the top 34%, indicating that the current dip might be a good buying opportunity.Most investors believe that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed plan of big infrastructure projects and a potential tax holiday could benefit the company in a huge way. In particular, is the tax holiday is created, it would bring back huge cash piles from outside the U.S. given that Cisco's offshore cash balance is the third largest in the tech space after AppleAAPLand MicrosoftMSFT(read:The Trump Effect: 8 Must-See ETF Charts).Given this, ETFs having the largest allocation to this network giant will be in focus for the days ahead. Investors should closely monitor the movement in these funds and grab the opportunity when it arises or avoid if the stocks drags them down:iShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETFIGNThis ETF provides a concentrated exposure to the domestic multimedia networking securities by tracking the S&P North American Technology-Multimedia Networking Index.

Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT);11/17/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsTarget Corporation(TGT) is the 3rd largest discount retailer in the United States based   on its $40 billion market cap.  OnlyCostco Wholesale Corporation(COST) andWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(WMT) are larger.Target has increased its dividend payments for anamazing 45 consecutive years.  The company's long dividend streak shows that Target's   business is strong and stable enough to reward shareholders over   a wide variety of economic conditions.makeArticleAd();Target's dividend streak puts it in rarefied air.  Target   is one of only50 Dividend Aristocrats.  Dividend Aristocrats are S&P 500stocks with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases.    Target just passed its ex-dividend date on November 14, and   will pay out 60 cents per share on December 10th.TGT stock currently has a high 3.5% dividend yield and a   low price-to-earnings ratio of 13.4.  With that in mind is   now the time to buy Target?This article examines the investment prospects of Target.Historical Growth & Future Growth ProspectsTarget has managed to grow its dividend payments at a compound   rate of 19% a year over the last decade.  Earnings-per-share   have grown at a more pedestrian 5.6% a year over the same   period.At this point it's important to note that earnings-per-share   growth (relative to dividend growth) is a better measure of   underlying intrinsic value per share growthfor Target.  That's because Target's dividend growth is a function of   significantly increasing its payout ratio.A decade ago, Target's payout ratio was around 15%.    Today, the company's payout ratio is 42%.  It's impossible   for TGT to triple its payout ratio again over the next   decade.  Therefore, Target's dividend growth is going to   slow.  I expect dividends to grow about in line with   earnings-per-share going forward.Target's earnings-per-share growth of 5.6% a year over the   last decade isn't great.  I'd put it in the 'mediocre   growth' category.  But here's the thing…TGT grew despite massive managerial missteps.Over the last decade, TGT dealt with a botched expansion into   Canada, a highly publicized data breach, and the Great   Recession.  Despite all this, the company still managed to   grow its earnings-per-share at 5.6% a year.The Best Investments for 2017Even if Target grows at 'just' ~5.5% a year over the next   decade, investors will see solid total returns when you factor in   the company's dividend yield.  TGT's 3.5% dividend yield   combined with minimum 5.5% expected earnings-per-share growth   gives investors expected total returns of 9.0% a yearbefore valuation multiple changes…TGT Stock ValuationThere are two factors that - more than any other - determine   the probability of success of an investment:Are you investing in a high quality business?Are you investing in a business that is either fairly     valued or undervalued?Looking at Target's long-term dividend streak gives us a big   hint as to whether Target is a quality business.The company has a strong and durable competitive advantage   that has allowed it to increase its dividend payments for 45   consecutive years.Specifically, TGT benefits from its large size.  In the   discount retail industry, size matters.  Large businesses   benefit from economies of scale.  They pass these discounts   onto customers.  Low prices attract more customers, making   the company even larger, in a virtuous cycle.On top of that, Target also has stores that are generally   perceived as cleaner and a bit more 'upscale' than rival   Wal-Mart.  The company's brand and reputation for   fashionable merchandise enhance the company's competitive   advantage.There's little doubt Target is a high quality business with a   shareholder friendly management… But is the company trading for   fair value?TGT currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just   13.4.  The company's historical average price-to-earnings   ratio over the last decade is around 15.5.  Based on its own   historical average price-to-earnings ratio, Target looks   undervalued at current prices.The company also looks (deeply) undervalued relative to the   S&P 500.  The S&P 500 is currently trading for a   price-to-earnings ratio of24.9.  Now ask yourself, is Target significantly worse than the   'average' S&P 500 stock?I don't think so…  And yet, the company trades for a   price-to-earnings ratio that is nearlyhalfthat of the S&P 500.Final Thoughts On Target's Investment ProspectsTarget has a long history of rewarding shareholders with   rising dividends.  The company went ex-dividend on November   14th - marking yet another dividend payment coming to   shareholders.  In addition to its high dividend yield,   Target also regularly repurchases its shares.  The company   has reduced its share count by around 15% over the last 5   years.Target's management is objectively shareholder friendly   judging by its dividends and share repurchases.  The company   has solid-if-not-spectacular expected growth as well.Even if Target manages to grow its earnings-per-share at just   5.5% a year, investors can still expect total returns of 9% a   year at current prices, thanks to Target's dividend yield.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is       Screeching to a HaltBut…  Actual investment returns are likely to be   higher.  That's because TGT appears undervalued at current   prices with its low 13.4 price-to-earnings ratio.Target is ranked as a Top 100 stockon the Dividend Manager Website (#8 overall), and also ranks in   the Top 25% of stocks usingThe 8 Rules of Dividend Investing.Dividend growth investors looking for exposure to the discount   retail industry should consider adding Target to their   portfolios.Article by Ben Reynolds,The Dividend ManagerThe postTarget Corporation (TGT) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon…   Is it a Buy?appeared first onValueWalk.Sure Dividend usesThe 8 Rules of Dividend Investingto systematically rank high-quality dividend growth     stocks.Click here to See My Top 10 Best Dividend Stocks       Today.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 201710 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10The postHere's Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy   (TGT)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Will Palo Alto (PANW) Spring a Surprise in Q1 Earnings?;11/17/2016;"Palo Alto Networks Inc.PANWis set to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 112.5%. Notably, Palo Alto has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 189.91%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPalo Alto Networks allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter, while revenues comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins coupled with expansion of the existing customer base positively impacted revenues. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward.The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure. Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOand Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. remain concerns.PALO ALTO NETWK Price and EPS SurprisePALO ALTO NETWK Price and EPS Surprise|PALO ALTO NETWK QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Palo Alto is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO);11/17/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsU.S. stock futures are trading cautiously higher this morning,   as Wall Street recoups after Wednesday's break in the   post-election rally. Interest rates and inflation are in focus   this morning, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is set to   testify before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, while   October consumer prices, housing starts, building permits and the   November Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index are all on tap.Against this backdrop,Dow Jones Industrial Averagefutures have edged 0.05% higher, withS&P 500futures up 0.10% andNasdaq-100futures rallying 0.28%.makeArticleAd();On the options front, volume continued its steady retreat from   the past week's elevated levels.  On Wednesday, 16.1 million   calls and 15.4 million puts crossed the tape, as activity resumed   a more normal pace. As for the CBOE, the single-session equity   put/call volume ratio bounced off Tuesday's three-month low to   arrive at 0.63, though the 10-day moving average continued to   decline, falling to a one-month low of 0.63.Among Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) received a boost afterTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) offered a bullish look at sales in its quarterly earnings   report. Elsewhere,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) call options soared on news thatAlphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is using AMD server graphics chips in its cloud   computing platform. Finally,Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) is off sharply inpre-market   tradingas earnings guidance comes up short of Wall Street's   expectations.Apple Inc. (AAPL)AAPL stock received a much-needed boost yesterday, after   Target noted in its quarterly earnings report that advanceorders for Apple products were three times   higherthan last year heading into the holiday shopping season. AAPL   stock was fresh off a test of support near its 200-day moving   average, below which the stock has not closed a session since   July. However, Apple's rally came up just shy of key resistance   at $110, and the shares are retreating from this region in   pre-market trading so far this morning.The 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 2017Options traders quickly jumped on yesterday's rally, though   many appeared to be fading the boost. Total volume came in at a   near-term high of 1.9 million contracts, with calls only   accounting for 57% of the day's take - well below AAPL stock's   average daily call percentage in the 62% to 63% region. In fact,   put open interest has grown considerably at the $110 strike, with   more than 37,000 contracts currently open in the November 18   series, indicating a lack of confidence that AAPL will overtake   this hurdle in the short-term.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD scored a major win on Wednesday, as news broke that Google   will use AMD 's server graphics processing units in its consumer   cloud services platform. AMD has had considerable success in the   gaming console market in recent years, but has yet to   significantly break into the server or cloud computing market. As   such, the Google news could be game changing for AMD.Options traders certainly think so, as volume surged to a   near-term high of nearly 300,000 contracts. What's more, bulls   were in charge of the spike in volume, with calls accounting for   72% of the day's take. That said, AMD is still trading shy of   peak call OI in the December series, which totals more than   15,600 contracts at the $8 strike. More details on the Google   front could provide the push AMD stock needs to put these calls   in the money.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)CSCO stock has been a major benefactor of the Trump rally, butCisco's quarterly reportsuggests that it may not benefit as much as Wall Street was   hoping. After the close last night, CSCO posted Street-beating   quarterly earnings of 61 cents per share on revenue of $12.35   billion - analysts were expecting earnings of 59 cents per share   on revenue of $12.33 billion. However, Cisco placed current   quarter guidance in a range of 55 to 57 cents per share, well shy   of Wall Street's target for 59 cents per share.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Back in the       'Buy' Column!CSCO stock is down more than 4% pre-market, and the shares   appear poised to test support near $30 - a level Cisco has not   closed a session below since July. Options traders were divided   heading into the report, as the more than 297,000 contracts   traded on CSCO stock were split down the middle between puts and   calls.Quite a few options traders may have been on the put-selling   train ahead of last night's report, as the November 18 series $30   strike sports OI of nearly 25,000 contracts. Unless the situation   worsenswhen the market opens, or the broader market takes a dive, these November $30 puts   should hold firm through the end close of trading tomorrow.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for       2017The postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Stock Futures Pull-Back on Bullish Econ Data;11/17/2016;"Stock futures were struggling to stay positive as Wall Street reacts to economic data that fuels expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike rates next month, and braces for Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress. After a stunning seven-day winning streak, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was poised to trade lower for a second day as the post-Election Day rally finally runs out of steam.Futures were cautiously higher before the 8:30ET data-dump and only slightly trimmed early gains on the pre-release of Yellen's testimony to the Joint Economic Committee. Contrary to past statements about monetary policy, Yellen cautioned that waiting too long to raise rates could ""undermine financial stability"", and that delaying increases in the Fed funds rate for too long could force the Fed to ""tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting policy goals.""Her remarks were followed by economic data that gave the Fed the ammunition it needs to hike rates in December. Nominal CPI rose 0.4% while the core was up 0.1%, jobless claims tumbled 19,000 to 235,000, and housing starts soared 25% in October to a 9-year high of 1.323 million. Permits were also strong last month, increasing 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.229 million. The only miss to the downside was the Philadelphia Fed business outlook index to 7.6 in November from October's 9.7. This is, however, the fourth consecutive month the index has been positive.makeArticleAd();In corporate news, Walmart (WMT) reported lower-than-expected comparable sales, Cisco (CSCO) Q4 guidance was below Wall Street expectations, and Best Buy (BBY) beat Q3 estimates and raised Q4 earnings guidance.

The commercial launch of the same is slated for the first quarter of 2017.Verizon's IoT Fast TrackVerizon clearly stated that its $15,000 IoT Fast Track services are specifically designed for small business owners instead of larger multinational companies such as auto makers who usually opt for cellular-based IoT offerings. The main motive behind this latest offering is to expand the company's addressable market for IoT services.The service will essentially connect small business owners interested in IoT ventures with Verizon consultants. It will also offer technical, supplier-related and expense details to the companies for the IoT installations. Moreover, customers will not have to purchase Verizon's network services to avail its IoT offerings.Meanwhile, the company said that it is looking forward to expanding in the IoT space further as it will allow it to better serve customers. The company also said that its IoT business, which includes smart cities, telematics, ThingSpace and other products, has risen 24% year over year to $217 million. ThingSpace integrates services ranging from LTE to WiFi which allow customers to collect and analyze IoT data.Recent IoT EventsThis September, Verizon entered into a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc.QCOM, to develop its IoT platform, ThingSpace. Meanwhile, Verizon's rival AT&T Inc.Tpartnered with Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOto launch an all-in-one IoT Starter Kit. Notably, these telecom companies are looking for alternative sources of revenue to offset the decline in their legacy businesses like fixed-line services.VERIZON COMM PriceVERIZON COMM Price|VERIZON COMM QuoteVerizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Growth Businesses Fall Short for Cisco Systems;11/16/2016;"Image source: Cisco Systems.Networking hardware giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal first-quarter results after   the market closed on Nov. 16. The company's results came in at   the high end of its guidance, but Cisco expects the second   quarter to be much weaker. Growth areas such as collaboration and   the data center suffered declines during the quarter, while   security continued to post robust growth. Here's what investors   need to know about Cisco's first-quarter results.makeArticleAd();Cisco Systems results: The raw numbersMetricQ1 2017Q1 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$12.35 billion$12.68 billion(2.6%)Net income$2.32 billion$2.43 billion(4.4%)Non-GAAP EPS$0.61$0.593.4%Data source: Cisco Systems.What happened with Cisco Systems this quarter?Adjusted for the sale of the SP Video CPE business, Cisco's   revenue was in line with the high end of its guidance.Adjusted revenue grew by 1% year over year.The switching segment suffered a 7% decline in sales,     generating $3.72 billion of revenue.The routing segment produced $2.09 billion of revenue, up     6%.The collaboration segment, which has been growing in recent     quarters, suffered a 3% sales decline, with $1.08 billion of     revenue.Data center revenue dropped 3% to $834 million.Wireless revenue dropped 2% to $632 million.The security segment continued to grow at a double-digit     rate, with revenue of $540 million representing growth of     11%.Service provider video, excluding the SP Video CPE     business, slumped 2% to $271 million.Deferred revenue rose 12% year over year to $17 billion,     driven by subscription-based software.Cisco's second-quarter guidance fell short of   expectations.Revenue is expected to decline by between 2% and 4%,     excluding the SP Video CPE business.GAAP EPS expected between $0.42 and $0.47, while non-GAAP     EPS expected between $0.55 and $0.57. For the second quarter of     last year, non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.57.What management had to sayCisco CEO Chuck Robbins summed up the quarter:We had a good quarter despite a challenging global business     environment and we performed well in our priority areas. We are     leading our customers in their digital transition by providing     them with highly secure, automated, and intelligent solutions     in the ways they want to consume them. Our innovation pipeline     is robust and we are well positioned for the future.Kelly Kramer, CFO of Cisco, discussed the shift to a   subscription model:We executed well in Q1 delivering profitable growth, and saw     strong adoption of our subscription-based and software     offerings as we transition our business to a more recurring     revenue model. We will invest in key growth areas and continue     to focus on delivering shareholder value.Looking forwardOne thing hurting Cisco's results is its ongoing shift toward   a subscription business model. The security segment grew revenue   by 11% year over year, but deferred revenue soared 39%. While   collaboration revenue slumped 3%, deferred revenue jumped 14%.   Cisco singles out the growth of software-as-a-service within   these segments as one reason for the discrepancy.With only one growth business, security, posting growth during   the first quarter, and with guidance for the second quarter   calling for a revenue decline, the difficult environment Cisco   finds itself in is taking a toll on the company.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than   Cisco SystemsDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Angers New MacBook Pro Fans Yet Again;11/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHas a laptop launch ever generated as much drama asApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) new MacBook Pro?The laptop with its new Touch Bar and boosted price tag was widely derided when announced, then unexpectedly recorded monster sales numbers. Now the new units are reaching customer hands, there's an outcry about MacBook Pro upgradability. As in there is none. What you buy is what you get - forever.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleOnce again, AAPL laptop fans are up in arms.Ifixit Confirms New MacBook Pro Can't Be UpgradedThe new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began to ship to customers this week. This should have been a triumphant moment for Apple. After all the complaining about the direction the company made with its new professional level laptops - from the Touch Bar itself, to the Butterfly keyboard, higher prices and most of all switching to USB-C exclusively and ditching all legacy ports - the new MacBook Pro has been a surprise hit.Out of nowhere, it bookedmassive pre-order sales numbers, outselling all competitors by a huge margin.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Launch Apple Glasses by     2018The 13-inch base model began arriving two weeks ago, and there was mainly positive feedback about its smaller size and zippy performance.This week, however, the more expensive new MacBook Pro models arrived.These are the ones aimed at the core MacBook Pro demographic, the professional users. The 15-inch MacBook Pro in particular is the best laptop AAPL offers -and the most expensive, with a $2,399startingprice. The outcry started almost immediately.IFIXITpublished one of the first tear downs of the new laptops andfound a big problem with MacBook Pro upgradability. For the first time, AAPL has completely locked out users from upgrading anything in its professional series laptops. The new MacBook Pro not only has the RAM and CPU soldered to the motherboard, the SSD is also soldered. So whatever configuration you order from AAPL is the laptop you are stuck with until you opt to buy a new one.Apple's March Toward Eliminating MacBook Pro UpgradabilityApple's MacBook Pro is well known for its longevity, which is one of the reasons for its popularity. It was not uncommon for professional users to extend the useful lifespan of one beyond five years by upgrading the RAM and replacing the stock storage with the latest and greatest solid state storage.The reputation is great, but long life makes it hard to make money. Better for profit if they instead buy a new laptop every two or three years. How do you get owners to upgrade more frequently? Apple embarked on a strategy that combined new features with increasingly limited MacBook Pro upgradability.In 2012, its flagship laptop gained a high-resolution Retina display, but AAPL also incorporated measures introduced with the MacBook Air: a non user-replaceable battery and RAM that was soldered to the motherboard. Apple often explains away the measures as necessary to make its laptops thinner, but that argument doesn't explain moves like switching to proprietary pentalobe screws in a clear attempt to prevent owners from opening the laptop case.In 2015 the MacBook Pro got a Force Touch keyboard, but users could still replace the stock SSD with a third-party option. However, with the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the SSD is now soldered as well.That means the two primary ways a MacBook Pro owner could traditionally extend the useful life of their laptop - increasing the RAM and adding a bigger, faster SSD - are now gone. If you want a MacBook Pro that's faster or has more storage capacity in a year or two, you have no choice but to buy a new one.Reaction and Impact on AAPLAs might be expected, the online reaction to Apple's move has been universally negative. No one other than Apple (and maybe external drive sellers) sees a win out of this move.Chinese Sabers Rattle Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock     to the CoreWill the discovery of non-upgradable SSDs put a damper on the new MacBook Pro's impressive sales? It's not going to make buyers happy, but most are likely to suck it up and make the purchase anyway. Now that the detail is widely known, AAPL is likely to end up generating even more revenue from sales.That base model 15-inch MacBook Pro comes with just 256GB of storage. Knowing they can never upgrade the storage, buyers might grit their teeth and opt for more capacity when they order. Doubling it to 512GB boosts the laptop price by $200, but maxing it out with 2TB of storage means shelling out an additional $1,400 to Apple.However, the ill will Apple has been generating among its core MacBook Pro customers does open a door. A Windows PC manufacturer -Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) comes to mind as being positioned to offer the premium design Apple customers demand -couldleverage the situation to make a play that hurts the MacBook Pro in the long term.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBuy Cisco Systems, Inc.

Zacks.com featured highlights: Cisco Systems, Cardiovascular Systems, Five9, Generac Holdings and Nxstage Medical;11/16/2016;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - November 16, 2016 - Stocks in this week's article includeCisco Systems(NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report),Cardiovascular Systems(NASDAQ:CSII-Free Report),Five9, Inc.(NASDAQ:FIVN-Free Report),Generac Holdings(NYSE:GNRC-Free Report) andNxstage Medical(NASDAQ:NXTM-Free Report).Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin   Matras:Top Stocks with Big Potential Catch-up MovesGiven the recent run-up in the market last week, here's a screen I've been using recently for my own stock picking.First, it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries. Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buys and Holds, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And that's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:•Best Zacks Ranked Sectors -- Best 8We're screening for only those stocks with the best (lowest) average Zacks Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sectors give us the best 50% of sectors.•Best Zacks Ranked Industries -- Best 132makeArticleAd();Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru. Since there are 264 'X' or expanded industries we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru. If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it's outside of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.•Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s. Only Strong Buys and Buys can get through.•Price and Avg. Volume greater than or equal to $5 and 100,000 sharesOnly stocks over $5 with at least an average of 100,0000 shares traded daily will be considered.•Relative % Price Change -- 4 Weeks greater than 0This means we're screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.•% Change in Price -- 4 Weeks: Bottom 50Then finally we're scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market, they increased in price less than their peers.So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector. This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks, you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from.And from that list of winners, we're selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list. Remember, these stocks aren't 'dogs' or unresponsive stocks. Quite the contrary; they have all outperformed the market. It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list. But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry, we've singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It's an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names.Here are 5 from that list:(NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report) Cisco Systems(NASDAQ:CSII-Free Report) Cardiovascular Systems(NASDAQ:FIVN-Free Report) Five9, Inc.(NYSE:GNRC-Free Report) Generac Holdings(NASDAQ:NXTM-Free Report) Nxstage MedicalAll great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Buy Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Regardless of Q1 Earnings;11/16/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) will present its quarterly earnings today after the bell, and   analysts have low expectations. That's because political and   economic uncertainty may have reduced capital spending on IT this   quarter. Yes,Cisco stockis near its 52-week high, but that position is in danger.Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)makeArticleAd();And one of the lesser-sung culprits might be open-source   hardware.A Threat to Cisco StockFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has beenpioneering open-source hardwarefor a few years now. Other firms with big data centers, such asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL),are doing likewise, designing their own hardware while Asian contract manufacturers   build it. Low-cost, open-source hardware threatens to commoditize   networking routers and switches, which firms such as CSCO rely   on. Other forms of hardware, such as servers, have been   commoditized, but networking remains the ""last bastion of proprietary IT.""The development ofsoftware-defined networkingmakes it easier for customers to use commodity hardware, known as   ""white boxes."" The appeal is twofold: this promises to reduce   costs while giving IT departmentsgreater control over the network, important for companies likeLinkedIn Corp(NYSE:LNKD).Both Facebook and LinkedIn's hardware projects   received media attention in the past weeks. LinkedIn is   designing its own data hardware withProject Altair, and software underProject Falco.10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10With Cisco's earnings due to be reported, now is time to   re-examine the threat of open-source hardware to Cisco, downside   risk to CSCO stock … and why Cisco should be able to   navigate this  transition without ending up on the   rocks.Cisco's Willingness to Disrupt ItselfOne problem Clayon Christensen writes about inThe Innovator's Dilemmais the failure of companies to disrupt themselves. Instead of   reacting to the threat of a low-cost disruptor, they ignore it,   and eventually go under.Cisco isn't burying its head in the sand and shying away from   disruption. Last year, former CEO John Chambers warned that   companies mustdisrupt themselvesor face disruption.Cisco has created ""spin-ins"" to deal with the threat of   software defined networking. As Varun Bhatiawrites:""Cisco disrupts itself by creating spin-ins, separate   companies that are fully owned by Cisco. Insieme networks   disrupts Cisco's hardware business by developing software that   does the same thing, only cheaper and with a lot less   hardware.""Lower-cost options could perhaps reduce Cisco's margins, but   it's better for CSCO to do this now rather than wait for someone   else t o. Steve Jobs was fond of saying, ""If you don't   cannibalize yourself, someone else will."" And Cisco can make up   for this with high-margin software and services.Cisco stock has navigated many transitions in the marke t   before, and with this proactive attitude, its chances of   succeeding look good.Indeed, Cisco might take a page out of theInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) playbook, which transitioned from being a hardware producer to   a software and services provider.Low Valuation on CSCO SharesCisco stock trades at around 15 times earnings and 12 times   forward earnings, below theDow Jones Industrial Averageand well below theS&P 500.  CSCO also trades at 2.5 times book value, and only 2.4   times its cash position.Mr. Market doesn't expect Cisco to grow much, limiting the   downside risk to CSCO stock. If the market were appraising Cisco   at 35 or 40 times earnings, the downside risk would be   greater.Cisco's valuation is on par with that of a market leader in a   maturing industry.Cash PositionCisco last reported $7.631 billion in cash and $58.125 billion   in short-term investments. When combined, these two equal 41% of   Cisco's $160 billion market capitalization.This gives Cisco a lot of breathing room, and has allowed CSCO   to go on a buying spree, announcing the purchase of IoT firmJasperin February and security startupCloudlockin June.Buying upstartsis a strategy for incumbents like Cisco to deal with   disruption.White Boxes Hold Limited AppealWhile white-box technology does promise companies lower costs   and greater control over their networks, their appeal is limited   to mostly larger firms with major IT teams.Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Jumps on Q3       Earnings Beat, But ...And the cost savings could be limited as well, since upfront   capital costs on equipment are lower than operating expenses. As   a spokesperson said in 2014:"" It is our belief that the open source switch market,   sometimes called the ""white box"" market, is largely only   attractive to a small, highly-resourced subset of the overall   I.T. market. That's because the approach is loaded with hidden   hard and operational costs. For example, networking capital   equipment outlays typically constitute only 30% of the cost of   running networks. Labor costs constitute 50%, and will increase   with the white box approach as IT departments are required to   install, integrate and update separate network operating systems   and network virtualization software.""Cisco's Margin Hasn't ErodedCisco's margins hold another sign that the IT behemoth has   greater staying power than expected. Instead of dropping in the   past few years, they'veheld steady. From SDX Central:""WhenVMwareacquired Nicira in 2012, many took it as a sign that the   SDN and white box eras were imminent, and that Cisco 's gross   margins could drop into the 50 percent range, writes analyst   Simon Leopold of Raymond James . However, over the course of   fiscal 2016, Cisco 's gross margins improved to almost 64 percent   with an operating margin at or above 30 percent.""Bottom LineCisco seems to be turning itself around, and it's nearing its   52-week high. Yes, it's possible that Cisco stock pulls back   after earnings tonight, but if it does, consider it a dip worth   buying.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of     the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Hit       Another Bump in the RoadThe 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for       2017The postBuy Cisco Systems, Inc.

Ford (F) to Continue With Plans for Production Shift to Mexico;11/16/2016;"Ford Motor Co.Fintends to continue with its international plans, including shifting the production of small cars to Mexico, despite the election results. Further, CEO Mark Fields stated that two other vehicles will be produced at the company's Michigan plant from which production of the aforementioned small cars will be shifted by 2018. He also assured that no jobs would be impacted by this decision.President-elect Donald Trump has criticized the decision of some companies to shift production to Mexico. With regard to Ford's decision to complete the shift by 2018, Trump stated that he would consider levying tariffs on the Mexican produced vehicles. Moreover, Trump stated his wish to remove the NAFTA agreement that includes Canada in addition to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent undocumented immigration.However, Ford has stood by its decision to shift the production that was announced in Sep 2016. The move is being undertaken to take advantage of lower costs in the country and in turn, boost profitability. The company's chairman has also stated that they have increased jobs in the U.S. over the last few years apart from producing the largest number of cars and trucks in the country compared to other automakers.Fields further stated that with the decline in gasoline prices, it is difficult for the company to generate profits from the small cars produced in the U.S. as increasing their prices would lower sales. A group representing major automakers, including Ford, has approached the President-elect's team to consider revision of the Obama administration's fuel economy standards. The standard calls on auto manufacturers to more than double the vehicles' fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.Ford further plans to ship a small utility vehicle, EcoSport, from India. The company said that it already has plants and investments globally, and can now concentrate on investments in the U.S., including the debut of its new SuperDuty pickup from a Kentucky-based plant. Fields stated that Trump's decision to impose a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico will affect the entire industry, which already operates in a competitive pricing environment.Automakers are not alone in taking advantage of low production costs in Mexico. In Sep 2016, Cisco SystemsCSCO, an IP-based networking company, also announced its decision to invest about $4 billion in Mexico to boost production of products such as routers, switches, servers and wireless access points.FORD MOTOR CO PriceFORD MOTOR CO Price|FORD   MOTOR CO QuoteFord's shares closed 0.2% lower at $12.04 on Nov 15.Zacks RankFord currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked automobile stocks include Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc.ALSNand Fox Factory Holding CorpFOXF, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Top Stocks with Big Potential Catch-Up Moves;11/15/2016;"Given the recent run-up in the market last week, here's a screen I've been using recently for my own stock picking.First, it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries. Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buys and Holds, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And that's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:•Best Zacks Ranked Sectors -- Best 8We're screening for only those stocks with the best (lowest) average Zacks Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sectors give us the best 50% of sectors.•Best Zacks Ranked Industries -- Best 132makeArticleAd();Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru. Since there are 264 'X' or expanded industries we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru. If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it's outside of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.•Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s. Only Strong Buys and Buys can get through.•Price and Avg. Volume greater than or equal to $5 and 100,000 sharesOnly stocks over $5 with at least an average of 100,0000 shares traded daily will be considered.•Relative % Price Change -- 4 Weeks greater than 0This means we're screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.•% Change in Price -- 4 Weeks: Bottom 50Then finally we're scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market, they increased in price less than their peers.So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector. This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks, you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from.And from that list of winners, we're selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list. Remember, these stocks aren't 'dogs' or unresponsive stocks. Quite the contrary; they have all outperformed the market. It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list. But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry, we've singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It's an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names.Here are 5 from that list:CSCOCisco SystemsCSIICardiovascular SystemsFIVNFive9, Inc.GNRCGenerac HoldingsNXTMNxstage MedicalAll great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Could Have a Sluggish Year Ahead;11/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) increasingly looks like a 2018 story - if you give CEO Bob Iger the benefit of the doubt - and that makes the coming year look like a lackluster one for DIS stock.Source:Richard Stephenson via Flickr (Modified)ESPN lost a record number of subscribers in October, an acceleration of a multiyear trend in which cord-cutters are leaving the sports network. ESPN's importance to DIS's operating profits is so critical that investors have a hard time focusing on anything else.makeArticleAd();That might have them missing Disney's wider strategy here.Old-line technology companies are going through painful transitions of their own. Places likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andOracle Corporation(NASDAQ:ORCL) are shrinking their traditional ways of distributing their goods and services in favor of the Cloud. Cloud-based services aren't growing fast enough to offset losses in the legacy businesses - but they will eventually.That's kind of what DIS is doing with ESPN. Sure, consumers are cutting cords, but that just means Disney has to reach them through new means of distribution, like internet TV and related tech.That's why Iger is able to remain sanguine in the face of such hefty subscriber losses. He has a plan to make up for them, but it's going to take time. As he said on a conference call with analysts after quarterly results:""[N]ew entrants in the marketplace, particularly [internet TV services], are going to offer ESPN opportunities that they haven't had before to reach more people. And in particular, we think those offerings, because of their pricing, user interface [and] mobile-friendly nature, are likely to cause more Millennials to either stay in the multichannel ecosystem as subscribers or to enter it when they might not have in the past.""DIS Goes Over the TopIt's a credible strategy but it doesn't change the fact that DIS stock looks pretty pricey for a company in transition with a business as important as ESPN.From analysts at Barclays:""With newer Over The Top bundles emerging, ESPN should be able to moderate some of the impact of legacy [pay-TV] declines. To be clear, we continue to believe ESPN is secularly challenged, and its affiliate growth of around 3%, second-slowest after Viacom (VIAB) , underlines this fact. However, with more visibility at least over the next year, we believe the drag from this factor on the stock is likely to moderate.""That can't happen fast enough for ESPN given its rate of decline, but long-term bulls need to accept that this is going to be a slog. The network shed 621,000 subscribers in October. Advertising fell 13% in the most recent quarter and affiliate fee revenue - which is the highest in cable - also declined.Click to EnlargeHappily for investors inDisney stock, the market is starting to buy in to Iger's vision. DIS missed Wall Street estimates and yet shares are up in the aftermath of earnings. That's a good sign. This is a stock that's lost more than 15% in the last 52 weeks pretty much on ESPN alone.But the market is going to remain very careful about this handoff to internet TV and over-the-top service providers. Like with CSCO and ORCL, it wouldn't be surprising to see DIS stock just kind of tread water in 2017.Energize Your Portfolio With Energy Select     Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE) OptionsThat said, investors can find some relief in that the Disney stock price does appear to have stopped declining. Shares have been rallying all month long. On a technical basis, the Disney stock price just overcame resistance at its 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average for the first time since May.If it can turn the 200-day MA into a level of support, it will be a lot easier to go along for what could be a long run in the saga that is ESPN.As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 20177 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire     GrowthThe postWalt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Could Have a Sluggish Year Aheadappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Reasons Why Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Is Worth Its Insane Valuation;11/15/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhy would anyone pay 300 times earnings for a stock, let aloneNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), a company that made just$52 millionin the third quarter from $2.2 billion in revenue?Source:Via NetflixEven better, why would someone buy Netflix stock when in Q3 2016 it used $462 million more in cash then came in the door from subscribers?makeArticleAd();For value investors, the answer's an easy one. They wouldn't.But for those who can see past the financials, I see three big reasons to remain interested in Netflix stock. Not the least of which is the fact the Netflix stock price has barely budged over the past 52 weeks, up just 1.7% through Nov. 11. Indeed, NFLX is due for a move higher.That said, it's not easy for me to write about the upside potential of Netflix.5 Tech Stocks in Trouble After TrumpIn September, I made the case whyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) wasa much better stock to buythan Netflix. Despite Jeff Bezos and Co.missingQ3 2016 earnings and revenue estimates, Amazon Web Services continues to grow by 50% or more each year, making it a very important piece of the Amazon pie.But really, I just love how Amazon isn't afraid to invest heaps of money in areas it feels have the greatest growth potential, regardless of the short-term hit to earnings. It's truly amazing.But there's something to be said of Netflix for adding 3.6 million members in the third quarter, 57% higher than its forecast for the three-month period ended Sept. 30.Netflix Still GrowingNetflix, Inc.'s subscriber growth represents a 4.3% increase in its global members, from 83.2 million at the end of Q2. As a result of its unexpectedly high sign-up rate, Netflix increased revenues in the third quarter by 36% year-over-year to $2.16 billion, the first time it's gone over $2 billion in global streaming in a quarter.Forget earnings. That's a significant accomplishment, especially on a constant currency basis where global streaming revenues in Q3 were up 39%, or 400 basis points higher year-over-year.Picking up three million members outside the U.S. each quarter, Netflix should see its international memberships overtake its U.S. memberships sometime in Q2 or Q3 2017. And that's without China coming on board anytime soon.Netflix has truly become a global business and the first global TV network.House of Cards Meets the House of MouseA couple of days afterInvestorPlacecontributor James Brumley wrote about why he thinkit makes senseforWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) to buy Netflix, fellow contributor Lawrence Meyers chimed in about the reasons whyit doesn't make sense.Both arguments are good ones.Brumley feels that Disney has to do something to pump up the tires of a lethargic ESPN subscriber count, while Meyers believes paying $45 billion or more to acquire an over-the-top television service that barely makes money is hardly a smart allocation of Disney's capital.Who's right? I believe Brumley is.Sure, buying Netflix would be Disney's largest acquisition ever - it acquiredCapital Cities/ABCin 1995 for$19 billion- and not an easy one to pull off, but the alternative is to pass on the video streaming company and sit idly by while a competitor of some description gobbles it up.I just don't think Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, who is looking to retire at some point in the not-to-distant future, will want to go out on a sour note.It might be a lot of money to pay, but it sends a signal to investors that Disney is serious about the digital world. And hopefully it's enough to keep ESPN relevant for years to come.Reed HastingsAs I said previously, Bob Iger is looking for the ideal person to replace himself at the head of the Disney table. Reed Hastings would be a logical candidate. He's built a huge business from scratch, understands the entertainment business and the idea of convergence, and he knows how Disney operates considering Netflix's existing pay-TVdealwith the company.It's not easy to find good CEOs; Hastings, despite his company's inability to generate free cash flow, is one of the best in the business. He might not be an internal candidate, but if DIS wants someone who can hit the ground running, I think he'd be at the top of the list.Bottom Line on Netflix StockNetflix stock's forward P/E is about half its trailing ratio, so we're not quite in the nosebleed valuation zone, but we're close. I believe that the value of a company to a large extent is what potential buyers are willing to pay.You might not think a baseball player is worth $30 million a season, but if a team's willing to pay that price, then the valuation, at least in their opinion, is more than fair.2 Post-Trump Trades for Cisco Systems, Inc.     (CSCO) EarningsAt the end of the day, that's all that really matters.I might not pay 150 or 300 times earnings for Netflix stock, but eventually, somebody will, whether it's Disney or another multi-billion corporation.Netflix will be acquired. We just don't know by whom.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace4 Biotech Stocks to Buy After Clinton's     DefeatThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The post3 Reasons Why Netflix, Inc.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: UnitedHealth Group, Merck, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group and Cisco Systems;11/15/2016;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - November 15, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeUnitedHealth Group Inc.(NYSE:UNH-Free Report),Merck & Co., Inc.(NYSE:MRK-Free Report),JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM-Free Report),Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.(NYSE:GS-Free Report) andCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Dow Stocks to Buy on Election Week RallyLast week, the Dow just registered its strongest five-day gains in around five years. Initially apprehensive about a Trump presidency, investors now seem to be welcoming the idea. Promises of looser regulation are boosting healthcare and financial stocks. Only technology seems to be affected, primarily due to Trump's campaign trail promises.However, this phase seems to be temporary and tech companies with the ability to innovate and deliver strong performance may soon benefit from the new regulatory environment. Investing in stocks from these sectors, which are also part of the blue-chip index, make for a safe and smart investment strategy.Markets Rally on Trump WinThe Dow gained 0.2% on Friday to post its highest weekly gains since Dec 2011. The index has increased by 5.4% over the last five days. The S&P and Nasdaq also rose, each registering weekly gains of 3.8%. After two volatile days of trading, markets relished the relative calm of Friday. Investors seem to have taken a breather after the excitement of the first two days following the declaration of election results.Initially, stocks had reflected investors' fears about the election's outcome, losing sharply in overnight trading. After losing nearly 800 points in late night futures trade, the Dow ultimately rose to gain 1.4% on Wednesday. Markets made a dramatic turnaround as investors snapped up healthcare and financial stocks, while dumping safe-haven assets. The index increased by 1.2% on Thursday, hitting an all-time high, a record which was quickly broken on Friday.Financials, Healthcare Chalk Up GainsFinancials emerged as the big winner last week with the Financial Services Select Sector SPDR gaining more than 11%. Bank stocks, in particular, have been racking up gains on hopes that Trump's presidency will boost financials. Expectations of a favorable regulatory environment, lower corporate taxes and a steeper yield curve are believed to be the primary triggers for these gains.Healthcare stocks have also received a boost. A far cry from Hillary Clinton's stance on the pharma sector, Trump's policies could bring to an end the ""draconian"" new pricing rules on drugs in the wake of scandals over prices. Trump's intention to repeal and replace Obamacare coupled with his plan to free up cash currently held overseas for tax reasons is also expected to boost the industry.Will Technology Suffer?One major loser which seems to have emerged in this scenario is the tech sector. Trump's position on Apple outsourcing its production, Amazon's tax issues and net neutrality seems to have skewered the pitch for these stocks. Trump has also adopted a tough stance on issues such as immigration and trade which have an immediate impact on the sector.But the ensuing panic in this domain and resultant losses may be only fleeting. Ultimately, this is a key growth area for the economy and may also benefit from deregulation and a business friendly environment. On Friday, shares of NVIDIA surged 29.8%, its best one-day performance since May 2003, after reporting better-than-expected fiscal third quarter results. Impressive performance from the chipmaker helped the technology sector to end in the green, which in turn boosted the Nasdaq.Our ChoicesMarkets have embraced a Trump presidency and seem to be going from strength to strength.

Tech Stocks Earnings Lined Up for Nov 16: CSCO, NTAP & More;11/15/2016;"We are in the final leg of the third quarter earnings season with 455 S&P 500 members, representing 91% of the index's total market capitalization, having already reported their results.As of Nov 11, total earnings of these companies were up 3.9% on a year-over-year basis (72.7% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue was up 2.7% on a year-over-year basis (55.4% of the companies beat top-line estimates).The earnings recession is expected to end in the third-quarter with positive growth arriving ahead of schedule. The third quarter can be interpreted as an inflection point where the growth trend is finally shifting from the negative territory to the positive territory.Notably, after five consecutive quarters of decline, earnings are finally back in the positive territory and the overall picture is that of improvement. Moreover, the proportion of companies beating both the topline and the bottomline estimates are modestly tracking above historical periods.As per our latestEarnings Previewreport, overall third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 3.4% (compared to an earlier estimate of a rise of 3.3%) from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 1.5%.While solid results from the finance sector buoyed the index higher, sluggish growth from the energy, autos, transportation and technology sectors was a drag.Coming to the technology sector, overall earnings are expected to be up 4.5% and margins are expected to remain marginally higher at 0.9% this earnings season.Here we take a look at three technology companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Nov 16:Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOis unlikely to beat first-quarter fiscal 2017 estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and anEarnings ESPof 0.00%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cisco's strategy of diversifying its business by introducing software-based networking tools and security services, and relying less on specialized routers and switching equipment appears to be yielding results.Moreover, partnerships with the likes of salesforce.comCRMand Pure StoragePSTGis a positive for the company's top-line growth. The recent acquisition of CloudLock will help it to broaden its efforts and meet the changing compliance as well as security needs.However, increasing competition and challenges in China remain concerns ahead of the upcoming release.CISCO SYSTEMS Price and EPS SurpriseCISCO SYSTEMS Price and EPS Surprise|CISCO SYSTEMS QuoteWe note that Cisco's results compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 7.95%. (Read More:Can Cisco Systems Pull a Surprise in Q1 Earnings?)Similarly,NetApp, Inc.NTAPtoo is unlikely to beat second-quarter fiscal 2017estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.NetApp is expected to gain momentum in the flash-based solutions space, with the newly introduced all-flash array. The company has been recognized a Leader in the 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays. Additionally, the company's improving penetration at the mid-size business segment is a positive.We believe that NetApp's recent product launches and expanding product portfolio will drive top-line growth in the near term.However, tepid IT spending for the rest of 2016 raises concerns about the company's near-term performance. Intensifying competition from Western DigitalWDCand HP Inc. add to its woes going into the quarterly earnings.NETAPP INC Price and EPS SurpriseNETAPP INC Price and EPS Surprise|NETAPP INC QuoteNotably, NetApp's results have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of 14.52%.

6 Dow Stocks to Buy on Election Week Rally;11/14/2016;"Last week, the Dow just registered its strongest five-day gains in around five years. Initially apprehensive about a Trump presidency, investors now seem to be welcoming the idea. Promises of looser regulation are boosting healthcare and financial stocks. Only technology seems to be affected, primarily due to Trump's campaign trail promises.However, this phase seems to be temporary and tech companies with the ability to innovate and deliver strong performance may soon benefit from the new regulatory environment. Investing in stocks from these sectors, which are also part of the blue-chip index, make for a safe and smart investment strategy.Markets Rally on Trump WinThe Dow gained 0.2% on Friday to post its highest weekly gains since Dec 2011. The index has increased by 5.4% over the last five days. The S&P and Nasdaq also rose, each registering weekly gains of 3.8%. After two volatile days of trading, markets relished the relative calm of Friday. Investors seem to have taken a breather after the excitement of the first two days following the declaration of election results.Initially, stocks had reflected investors' fears about the election's outcome, losing sharply in overnight trading. After losing nearly 800 points in late night futures trade, the Dow ultimately rose to gain 1.4% on Wednesday. Markets made a dramatic turnaround as investors snapped up healthcare and financial stocks, while dumping safe-haven assets. The index increased by 1.2% on Thursday, hitting an all-time high, a record which was quickly broken on Friday.Financials, Healthcare Chalk Up GainsFinancials emerged as the big winner last week with the Financial Services Select Sector SPDRXLFSgaining more than 11%. Bank stocks, in particular, have been racking up gains on hopes that Trump's presidency will boost financials. Expectations of a favorable regulatory environment, lower corporate taxes and a steeper yield curve are believed to be the primary triggers for these gains.Healthcare stocks have also received a boost. A far cry from Hillary Clinton's stance on the pharma sector, Trump's policies could bring to an end the ""draconian"" new pricing rules on drugs in the wake of scandals over prices. Trump's intention to repeal and replace Obamacare coupled with his plan to free up cash currently held overseas for tax reasons is also expected to boost the industry.Will Technology Suffer?One major loser which seems to have emerged in this scenario is the tech sector. Trump's position on AppleAAPLoutsourcing its production, Amazon'sAMZNtax issues and net neutrality seems to have skewered the pitch for these stocks. Trump has also adopted a tough stance on issues such as immigration and trade which have an immediate impact on the sector.But the ensuing panic in this domain and resultant losses may be only fleeting. Ultimately, this is a key growth area for the economy and may also benefit from deregulation and a business friendly environment. On Friday, shares of NVIDIA Corp.NVDAsurged 29.8%, its best one-day performance since May 2003, after reporting better-than-expected fiscal third quarter results. Impressive performance from the chipmaker helped the technology sector to end in the green, which in turn boosted the Nasdaq.Our ChoicesMarkets have embraced a Trump presidency and seem to be going from strength to strength. The result has come as a fillip to investors even before any major policy announcements.Picking stocks from the blue chip index for your portfolio is a prudent option at this point.

As Cybercrime Rises, So Does Spending On Cyber Security;11/14/2016;"The world is becoming increasingly connected through networks and data in an ecosystem governed by digital technologies which have created immense opportunities for individuals, businesses and organizations. The assimilation of mobile, IoT devices, cloud computing, and other high-tech solutions have changed the way people, businesses, organizations and governments connect and work.While the interconnectivity of devices and use of sophisticated technologies is positively changing the world, it is increasingly being challenged by cybercrime, clearly reflected by the steep rise in the number of cyber-related frauds and crime reported in the recent years.Cisco points out that, “Cybercriminals have refined their back-end infrastructures to carry out attacks in ways that increase efficiency and profits” and thus every industry, from financial services to entertainment, is vulnerable to such risks. In 2015, cybercrime ranked as thesecond mostreported economic crime. Increasingly frequent and precision-based cyber-attacks call for a stronger fortification against them.makeArticleAd();Cyber attacks can be categorized across various degrees. While some involve data breaches which exposes sensitive information like trade secrets, personal data, intellectual property, and other confidential information, others threats involve disabling software infrastructure, taking over systems, or denial of service.The total number of cyber security incidents reported in 2009 were 3.4 million while the number increased to 59.1 million in 2015, as per a PwC globalsurvey. “The U.S. Federal Reserve detected more than 50 cyber breaches between 2011 and 2015, with several incidents described internally as ""espionage,"" according to Fed records” asreportedby Reuters. A recently releasedreportby MetricStream reveals that 66.2% of financial organizations faced at least one cybersecurity attack in the last year.Popular retail houses such as Target and Home Depot have been victims of such activities resulting in loss of costumer data and credit card information. Not just companies, even individuals are prone to risk with an estimated an “estimated 556 million people falling victim to cybercrime annually” which translates to 12 people every second. These figures perhaps don’t reflect the exact situation as many cybercrime incidents either go unreported or undetected for a long time.Cyber attacks don't just result in losses of money or data, they also dent the reputation of the entity affected by the attack, culminating in the loss of trust among suppliers and customers. Attacks can also trigger regulatory or legality proceedings, negligence claims, and can lead to the loss of productivity and competitiveness, especially in cases of industry espionage which often go undetected. It ispredictedthat globally, cybercrime costs will touch $6 trillion annually by 2021, from $3 trillion in 2015.The race among the cyber criminals and cyber security providers is a tough and a challenging one. It is unbelievable how a computer node in part of the world can actually play mischief with bank accounts or get control of a company’s sensitive data, which may be in another part of the world.Given the growing incidence and sophistication of cyber-attacks, corporations and governments have increased allocations towards combating cybercrime. In fact, many have even resorted to insurance coverage for cyber liability. It isestimatedthat the cyber insurance market could grow to $5 billion by 2018 in annual premium and to at least $7.5 billion by 2020.The global spending on cybersecurity products and services for defending against cybercrime is projected to exceed $1 trillion cumulatively over the next five years, from 2017 to 2021 as per theestimatesof Cybersecurity Ventures.In the U.S., President Obama laid great emphasis on cybersecurity as he identified it “as the most serious economic and national security challenge.” According to the Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP), the U.S. administrationannouncedan investment of over $19 billion for cybersecurity as part of the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Budget, representing a more than 35% increase from FY 2016 in overall Federal resources for cybersecurity.Microsoftestimatesthat by 2020, 4 billion people will be online, 50 billion devices will be connected and data volume will be 50 times great than it is today. It is also estimated that about 75% of infrastructure will be controlled by third party cloud or internet service providers. Thus, “As we look to the future, the explosion of connected devices and data flows are making it even more challenging to protect against advanced targeted attacks.”While this is a challenging situation, there lies great opportunity for companies operating in the field of cyber security, as they witness an increased demand for products which empower companies and institutions to fight the menace of cybercrime.International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), root9B Technologies Limited (RTNB), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), Check Point Software Technologies Limited (CHKP), FireEye, Inc. (FEYE), Gigamon, Inc. (GIMO) and Symantec Corporation (SYMC) are some of the listed companies in the U.S. working actively on cyber security solutions. The increased competiveness within the space and the challenges thrown by hackers and cybercriminals are compelling these companies to stay ahead of the dark shadows looking to cast their spell."

Interesting January 2019 Stock Options for CSCO;11/14/2016;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for CSCO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $20 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 98 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.9% return against the $20 commitment, or a 2.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSCO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 36.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $19.02 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 98 cents from $20), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.2% annualized rate of return.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $40 strike and collecting the premium based on the 76 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 1.1% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 4.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $40 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CSCO shares would have to advance 27.4% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 29.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Cisco Systems, Inc., highlighting in green where the $20 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $40 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cisco Systems, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading dayCSCO historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $31.39) to be 22%.Top YieldBoost CSCO Calls »"

3 Top Internet of Things Stocks to Buy Now;11/14/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.After a seemingly constant stream of discussion by the media,   it's hard not to have heard of the Internet of Things. The trend   of connecting everything to, well, almost everything else is   expected to unleash a torrent of innovation and new profit   opportunities for investors in the years and decades to come.makeArticleAd();Case in point: IT giantCiscopredicts the number of connected devices will double from 25   billion to 50 billion by the end of the decade. ResearcherIDCexpects the market for IOT-related technology will total $1.7   billion by 2020. Even if you find these estimates remarkably   bullish, the trend and its eventual financial impact are real. As   such, here are three great stocks to buy today to ride the   expansion of the Internet of Things.Qualcomm (via NXP Semiconductor)I'velong admiredmobile chip powerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) on its own merit, and its recent decision to   acquire IoT semiconductor leaderNXP Semiconductor(NASDAQ: NXPI) is one of the smartest tech buyouts in recent   memory.NXP Semiconductor's leadership across several growing   sub-segments of the semiconductor market should prove a   long-term financial tailwind for Qualcomm investors. Though NXP's   revenue base is roughly a quarter the size of Qualcomm,   NXP's impressive 25% profit margin should help diversify   Qualcomm's own shrinking, but still sizable, margin profile.Furthermore, NXP's deep specialization in secure connections   also leaves the door open for future product development in areas   few can predict in the decades to come. As the market for secure   connected chips continues to grow and spawn new product   verticals, NXP and Qualcomm figure to benefit mightily from the   continued rise of the Internet of Things. Better yet, Qualcomm's   17 times price-to-earnings ratio is surprisingly cheaper than the   broad market indices, and its 3.1% dividend yield offers   another compelling driver of potential returns.Skyworks SolutionsIn an era of ever-shrinking chip sizes,Skyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) stands as a giant. A major supplier to smartphone   giants likeAppleandSamsung, Skyworks has seen the continued penetration of mobile devices   and wearables help fuel its steadily rising sales. Thanks to this   trend, Skyworks Solutions has grown its sales from $1.5 billion   to $3.2 billion in just three years' time. Better still, the   inherent operating leverage in Skyworks' business model has   allowed profit growth to outpace sales growth by a wide degree   over the same period, and this trend of continued growth shows   little sign of slowing.Thanks to its specialization in helping chips of all types   perform their computing tasks with less space and power,   Skyworks' technological skillset beautifully overlaps with the   Internet of Things, a trend that is fundamentally predicated on   putting small sensors in as many devices as possible. By its own   reckoning, Skyworks believes that by 2020, there will be over 2   billion smartphones, 1 billion personal computers, and over 43   billion IoT devices. The growth opportunity facing this IoT stock   is simply tremendous. Better still, Skyworks Solution shares   trade at just 14 times their current earnings, making it a highly   affordable way to invest in the continued expansion of the   Internet of Things.NVIDIAThough perhaps we don't think about it in such explicit terms,   a future involving IoT devices like self-driving cars, autonomous   delivery drones, and robot workers needs a way to keep them from   crashing into one another. Thankfully, because of its   long-standing expertise in graphics processing chips or GPUs --   the hardware innards responsible for converting images into   computing data, or vice versa --NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) seems poised to address this easily overlooked but   critical need.In addition to self-driving cars, NVIDIA also enjoys major IoT   growth opportunities in the data visualization and data center   computer markets. The rise of virtual reality (VR), augmented   reality (AR), and professional gaming serve as a compelling   non-IoT growth driver as well. Here's how those four core growth   segments have performed in recent years.Image source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA's shares trade at an admittedly steep valuation; its 55   times P/E ratio stands as more than double theS&P 500's 24 times P/E multiple. However, analysts expect NVIDIA   earnings per share to grow at nearly 24% annually for the next   five years, which should provide ample profit growth to support   sustained share price appreciation. Better still, NVIDIA has paid   a small but growing dividend since 2012, making it a fantastic   way to invest in the Internet of Things in addition to Qualcomm   and Skyworks Solutions.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Dust Settles on Election, Q3 Earnings;11/14/2016;"Monday, November 14, 2016makeArticleAd();Following the best week in the Dow for the past five years, market futures are relatively tepid early this Monday. The immense relief rally that followed the year-and-a-half-long marathon of the U.S. General Election, and the subsequent hopefulness in the Pharma, Finance and Construction spaces from a President Trump administration helped markets rise ""bigly"" last week.Further, we saw the Volatility Index (VIX) fall precipitously in the week, tumbling to its third-largest weekly drop in history (the steepest week-long drop was the week following Great Britain's Brexit vote). Meanwhile, the 10-year bond yield shot up to its highest level since the beginning of the year, and continues to ride higher this morning at over 2.2%. The 10-year had been wallowing in 1.7% territory throughout most of the summer. Yields are rising at the same time the stock market is rising - how long can we expect this to last?Also, Q3 winds down ahead of holiday season, with just 21 S&P 500 companies remaining to report this week, mostly in big-box retail. Earnings from companies like Home DepotHDTuesday, CiscoCSCOand TargetTGTWednesday, Wal-MartWMTThursday and Foot LockerFLFriday are some of the biggest names we expect to be hearing from this week.Q3 earnings season will have been the first quarter in the the last six to bring positive earnings results in aggregate, breaking a five-quarters-long earnings recession in the U.S. In other words, the last time before Q3 2016 we saw positive earnings results was back before the presidential election had gotten underway.Looking ahead, we do see weakness in the oil market. An OPEC meeting scheduled for later this month appears to have its work cut out for itself, at least in terms of oil-rich nations agreeing to cut back production and work down the global supply glut that has created headwinds for the market over the past year-plus. Ahead of today's bell, we see the WTI -1.1% and Brent crude -0.9%.Market indices had been mixed earlier this morning, but a half-hour before the opening bell we are again in positive territory: S&P 500 +6.5, Dow +73 and Nasdaq +0.25. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has seen the most pressure since Donald Trump won the election, as tech services and manufacturing being heavily reliant on Asian markets look to have the toughest time fighting through new presidential policies.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty;11/14/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis has been a hard week forFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and FB stock. Its self-selecting ""news"" feeds are being blamed for Donald Trump. But the company's problems go well beyond Trump.Source:Via FacebookGovernments around the world are balkanizing the internet, telling websites, and users, what they can read, write and think.makeArticleAd();From Europe's ""right to be forgotten"" to China's ""great firewall,"" from Africa to Turkey, governments are seeing communication between people as something that can, must and will be tamed.This is very bad for any company which, like Facebook, grew up on the premise of openly communicating across personal and physical borders.If Facebook is to continue to grow - the FB stock price action on Nov. 10 (a crash of nearly $10 per share, then a slow recovery of half that) indicates real skepticism on that point - then the key will be new technology and emerging markets.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017The company has some apps for that.FB Stock and Emerging MarketsCEO Mark Zuckerberg, who transformed FB from a fast-growing ""social network"" four years ago into the hyper-growth ""mobile network"" form of today, is focused on delivering services not just on the hardware and networking schemes people may want, but on those that they have.Its new Snapchat competitor, Flash, wasbuilt specifically for markets where WiFi is scarce and connectivity is weak.It does represent an upgrade for consumers in places like Brazil, who are still using text messaging but will eventually communicate by pictures taken on smartphone cameras. But it's not as network, storage or compute heavy as its larger rival, and in those markets, that is important.Facebook stockis also finding challenges in Africa, where growth is slowing due to poor-quality networks. Its Free Basics service, where it works with local operators to deliver free bits in 53 countries, is said to have brought 25 million new people online, although it's controversial by making FB services the basic internet people see. It has been banned in Egypt and refused in India.Express Wi-Fi is supposed to help small entrepreneurs bring communities online, and Aquila could be a fleet of planes beaming internet signals from the sky. But the explosion of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket in September, which destroyed Facebook's Amos 9 internet satellite, was a huge blow to those network extension hopes.FB Is Becoming a Tech CompanyIn the U.S., FB is becoming a genuine tech company, not just a big company that uses tech.Facebook's Open Compute Project, which it first launched to help build its own data centers, is now getting contributions from other big companies, likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), creatinga do-it-yourself cultureamong the biggest Internet companies, who built their original centers on low-cost computers with their own racks.FB is working on millimeter wave technology that can deliver multi-gigabit speeds without wires. Reach is limited with such high-frequency waves, but Facebook engineers have tossed them across 13 miles, and supplemented them with line-of-sight optical links to run 20 GBits using frequencies as high as 2 GHz, deliveringalmost 10 bits per second for each Hertz of bandwidth, to be used as backhaul for local Open Cellular access and the Aquila planes.FB has also introduced Backpack, a modular switch that can transfer data at 100 Gbps inside a data center. This could create serious competition forCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andJuniper Networks, Inc.(NYSE:JNPR), being much faster than what they offer.It's also open source. As huge customers take control of their own basic technology, vendors may get squeezed out, but the customers will see lower costs allowing them to build more such centers and gain more power.Bottom Line on Facebook StockSince I seldom use Facebook, and I resisted buying FB stock until recently. I'm underwater on the investment.The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will KillDespite the company's moves into new technologies and new niches, this is an investment game where the numbers don't matter for Facebook stock. Bringing almost 25% of $7.011 billion in revenue to the bottom line, as it did in the third quarter, won't matter to FB stock bears who see thecontent challengesrather than the technology opportunities.Facebook stock will be a big victim of the American election; therefore, those who believe in the technology should get in now before the FB stock price rises again.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Nokia (NOK) to Offer LTE-R Service to Korea Rail Network;11/14/2016;"Nokia CorporationNOKrecently inked a deal with Korea Rail Network Authority (""KRNA"") to provide LTE-R mobile broadband network to the latter. Notably, this is the first time that such a technology will be deployed.KRNA maintains and develops railway infrastructure in South Koreaas well as several other countries. Its railway operations and employee services would, therefore, be highly benefited by the new broadband network technology. The LTE-R service will be initially introduced on a railway line between Wonju and Gangneung in South Korea as the country is gearing up to host a major international sporting event in 2018.Details of New TechnologyThe LTE-R technology is a version of the popular 4G LTE technology. The new technology is currently being developed to cater to the various requirements of railway operators. KRNA's communication network will utilize the LTE-R technology for operational and maintenance purposes. The company's high speed commercial railway line can reach speeds of up to 250 kilometers per hour and the LTE-R technology should ensure a secure, trustworthy and high-speed connection among trains, stations and other facilities.The company's project will also serve as the base for the future applications of the LTE-R technology. Nokia will be supplying radio access networks (RAN) base stations (eNodeBs) in addition to Nokia NetAct(TM) for this project. NetAct provides advanced assurance capabilities that forms a key component of the company's multi-domain Service Assurance program. NetAct is also utilized for providing railway operations and employee service management applications to KRNA.Despitestiff competition from peers like Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCO, Motorola Solutions Inc.MSIand InterDigital Inc.IDCC, Nokia carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.

A Weak Quarter Expected for Cisco Systems;11/13/2016;"Networking hardware giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) has made a habit of beating analyst estimates, and   the company will try to extend that streak when it reports its   fiscal first-quarter results after the market close on Nov. 16.   Cisco performed better than expected during the fourth quarter,   but the announcement of significant layoffs balanced out that   good news. Revenue has declined for three quarters in a row, and   Cisco's guidance suggests that a fourth quarter of decline is   likely.Image source: Cisco Systems.makeArticleAd();What analysts are expectingCisco guided for year-over-year revenue growth between -1% and   1%, excluding divestitures, during the first quarter. The average   analyst estimate, which doesn't exclude that negative impact,   calls for revenue of $12.34 billion, a 2.7% drop. Analysts do   expect Cisco to return to revenue growth during the second   quarter, but it looks likely that another revenue decline is in   the cards.Turning to earnings, analysts expect Cisco to produce non-GAAP   EPS of $0.59, right in the middle of the company's guidance   range. This represents flat earnings compared to the prior-year   period. During the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS surged 9%, driven   by a higher gross margin and lower operating expenses. That kind   of growth is unlikely to be repeated during the first   quarter.A restructuring plan amid tepid growthCisco still derives the bulk of its revenue from networking   switches and routers, two businesses that are no longer producing   much growth. Collaboration, data center, and security are three   growth areas Cisco has focused on in recent years, and the   company's restructuring efforts could help accelerate growth in   those businesses.Cisco planned to eliminate 5,500 positions beginning in the   first quarter -- roughly 7% of its global workforce. These   layoffs are occurring in low-growth areas, with the company   expecting to reinvest the cost savings in businesses that have   the potential to return the company to growth. It's unlikely that   there will be an immediate impact, but investors should expect to   hear more about this plan from management during Cisco's earnings   conference call.Overseas cashCisco is one of many large technology companies that have   mountains of cash sitting overseas. At the moment, bringing that   cash back to the U.S. would trigger repatriation taxes of 35%.   Following the election of Donald Trump, who promised to allow   U.S. companies to bring back overseas cash andpay a 10% tax rate, the issue of Cisco's cash is likely to come up during the   company's conference call.Cisco has taken on debt in order to fund dividends and share   buybacks, while its hoard of cash continues to grow. If a lower   repatriation tax is implemented, it would allow Cisco to bring   back that excess cash, potentially fueling a higher dividend   payment, more share buybacks, or a greater number of   acquisitions. Investors should be on the lookout for any guidance   on that front.Growth businessesDuring fiscal 2016, collaboration and security were standouts   for Cisco in terms of growth. The collaboration segment, which   includes everything from video conferencing equipment to the   company's Spark communications software, has grown into the   third-largest segment. Security is much smaller, but it grew at a   double-digit pace in fiscal 2016, and a slew of recent   acquisitions should help drive continued growth.One thing holding Cisco's revenue and earnings back is the   company's shift toward subscription-based software and services.   Both the collaboration and security businesses heavily tilt   toward software, creating a situation where an increasing amount   of revenue is realized over time instead of up front. During the   fourth quarter, Cisco's deferred revenue from software and   subscriptions grew by 33%. That growth is a good indication that   Cisco's strategy is working, despite the sluggish headline   numbers.On an absolute basis, Cisco's first quarter is likely to be   lackluster. A revenue decline and flat earnings are nothing to   get excited about. The company's guidance will be important, as   will commentary from management regarding its overseas cash, the   effects of its restructuring, and how it expects the results of   the election to affect its international business. With Cisco   deriving a significant portion of its revenue from international   markets, any backlash against American companies would be bad   news for the tech giant.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week;11/13/2016;"Stocks rose by a wide margin last week, despite a surprising   result in the U.S. presidential election that originally sent   markets plunging. By the end of the week theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) had gained over 5% to reach a new record high.   TheS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  added 4% to bring its year-to-date gain   to 6%.^DJIdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();In the week ahead,Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) ,Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andJ.M.Smucker(NYSE: SJM) shareholders are likely to see big moves in their   investments tied to fresh earnings reports.Wal-Mart's customer trafficWal-Mart posts its earnings results before the market opens on   Thursday morning. The world's biggest retailer is outperforming   the market so far this year on evidence that its sales growth   rebound is gaining steam. At its last quarterly check-in,   Wal-Mart beat management's forecast for comparable-store sales   gains as it enjoyed its seventh consecutive quarter of increasing   customer traffic. That improvement, plus decent results on the   e-commerce side, helped sales tick slightly higher despite an   almost 3-percentage-point headwind from currency changes.Image source: Wal-Mart.Consensus estimates call for similarly weak growth this   quarter, with revenue rising 1% to $119 billion. Profits should   decline to $0.96 per share from $0.99 per share a year ago as the   company continues to invest inimproving the shopping experiencethrough initiatives like higher employee wages and cleaner store   designs. Management will be happy to take that minor profit   decline so long as it produces higher shopper satisfaction   heading into the all-important holiday shopping season.Cisco's profit marginNetworking giant Cisco will announce earnings numbersafter the market closeson Wednesday. And, with the stock up 15% so far this year,   expectations are high heading into the report. Investors have   good reasons to be bullish -- especially on profits. While sales   haven't budged over the last 12 months, Cisco produced 21% higher   earnings over that time as cost cuts flowed directly down to the   bottom line.Image source: Getty Images.The company's diverse portfolio also showed its strength   recently, as declines in the service provider video and NGN   routing areas were completely offset by gains in other places   like switching and collaboration.CEO Chuck Robbins and his team forecast that sales will tick   up by 1% this quarter as non-GAAP gross margin weighs in at about   64%, or just ahead of last quarter's 63% mark. Investors can   expect management to highlight the fastest-growing areas of its   networking business on Wednesday in addition to its hefty cash   generation. Cisco delivered nearly $9 billion to shareholders in   the last fiscal year, mostly through dividends, and that figure   should rise by a healthy margin in fiscal 2017 -- assuming Cisco   can navigate itsbiggest growth challenges.Smucker's pet food salesJ.M. Smucker, the company behind consumer food brands such as   Jif peanut butter and Crisco vegetable oil, hopes to get back to   its winning ways with results this week. The stock has pulled far   back from the record high it reached just before its late-August   earnings report revealed worrying growth trends. Smucker's big   push into the pet food market has been a challenge so far, for   example, as the segment suffered lower volume. Its coffee   business also slowed down from its awesome growth pace thanks to   falling costs that track the declines in coffee bean prices.As a result of those and other challenges, executives lowered   their full-year sales growth target and now see revenue declining   slightly for the 2017 fiscal year rather than holding steady.   Investors will likely get an update on that projection this week.   They'll also find out whether Smucker's still believes it will   produce $1 billion of free cash flow and as much as $7.75 per   share of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2017.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than   Cisco SystemsDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

4 Cybersecurity Stats That Will Blow You Away;11/13/2016;"The global cybersecurity market could grow from $122.45   billion today to $202.36 billion by 2021, according to a new   report from Research and Markets. The firm believes that growth   will be driven by an increase of connected objects across the   Internet of Things, relaxed BYOD (bring your own device) policies   at work, and the need for tighter application security.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();It also estimates that the banking, financial services, and   insurance market vertical will experience the highest growth due   to the rising adoption of web and mobile apps, and that the Asia   Pacific region will experience the highest growth as growing   markets like China and India deploy more cybersecurity   solutions.That forecast sounds bullish, but investors should also   examine these four other stats to understand how rapidly the   cybersecurity market could grow within the next few years.Stat number oneNearly178 million personal recordswere exposed in data breaches in 2015, according to the Identity   Theft Resource Center. Nearly 70% of those breaches occurred in   the healthcare sector, and almost 20% occurred at   government/military agencies.These organizations will likely increase their cybersecurity   budgets considerably in the near future, which means more   business for ""best in breed"" perimeter defense companies likeFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) andPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) . FireEye's threat prevention platform identifies   incoming threats before they strike, and Palo Alto's next-gen   firewalls prevent them from reaching internal networks.Larger companies with bundled security solutions -- likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andSymantec(NASDAQ: SYMC) -- will also likely see stronger demand for their   security appliances and services.Stat number twoThe global cost of handling cyberattacks is expected to rise   from$400 billion in 2015 to $2.1 trillion by 2019, according to estimates fromLloyd's and Juniper Research. That includes direct damage as well as   post-attack disruptions. Payroll giantADP, hard drive makerSeagate, the FBI, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security --   which were all  struck by data breaches this year -- all   know how costly these attacks can be.While larger companies and organizations are gradually   responding to these threats, Cisco's 2016 Annual Security Report   found that just 29% of small to medium-sized businesses used   basic security tools like configuration and patching to prevent   breaches --downfrom 39% in 2014.Stat number threeDespite that apparent complacence,52% of respondentsin CyberEdge Group's 2015Cyberthreat Defense Reportbelieved that their companies would be hit by successful   cyberattacks within the year. That fear is certainly justified --   Symantec, best known to consumers as the maker of Norton   Antivirus, recently discovered thatthree quarters of all websiteshad exploitable vulnerabilities.Companies like Symantec are also evolving into ""all-in-one""   guardians for these businesses and organizations. Symantecrecently acquiredsecurity firm Blue Coat to add its network and cloud protection   services to its core portfolio of security solutions for PCs,   data centers, and emails. That move makes it an ""end-to-end""   security provider which offers ""layers"" or protection, which   previously required services from multiple vendors.Stat number four43% of data breaches were caused internally, according to a report  fromIntelSecurity last September. Half of those breaches were accidental,   caused by poor security practices, while the other half were   intentional -- caused by disgruntled employees and malicious   insiders.Although internal data breaches are rising, most cybersecurity   companies only focus on external threats with firewalls and   threat prevention systems. The standout performer in the internal   data breach market isCyberArk(NASDAQ: CYBR) , the market leader in PAM (privileged account   management) solutions. CyberArk's platformlocks downcompromised systems and quarantines internal threats before they   can spread to other parts of the network.The key takeawayInvesting in most cybersecurity stocks today isn't for queasy   investors, since many of these high-growth players have high   valuations, low profits, and are prone to wild price swings.   However, less risk-averse investors should still keep one or two   cybersecurity stocks in their long term portfolio since the   market still remains ripe for long-term growth and   consolidation.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock     price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know     investors! To be one of them,just click here.Leo Sunowns shares of Cisco Systems and CyberArk Software.

3 Tech Stocks That Turned $5,000 Into Over $1,000,000;11/12/2016;"$5,000 might not seem like enough to invest in the stock   market. However, $5,000 put in the right stock could blossom to   more than $1 million over a few decades. Let's take a closer look   at three of the most well-known examples from the tech industry   --Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AppleApple went public in 1980 at  $22 per share. $5,000 would   have been enough to buy 227 shares. After four splits, you would   now own 12,712 shares, which would be worth roughly $1.3 million.   Moreover, that position would be paying out nearly $29,000 in   dividends per year.Apple's early years, which mainly relied on Apple II and Mac   sales, were rocky. Co-founder Steve Jobs left his own company   after a dispute with the board in 1985, and its products were   subsequently crushed by Microsoft's rapidly growing market share   acrossIBMPC clones.Apple's growth didn't get back on track until an older and   wiser Jobs returned to Apple in 1997. With a renewed focus on   sleek hardware and end-to-end control of its ecosystem, Jobs'   Apple launched the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad -- all hit   products which redefined their respective industries. Between   1997 and 2011 -- the year Jobs resigned and passed away --   Apple's annual revenue rose from  $7.1 billion to    $108.2 billion. That figure hit $215.6 billion in fiscal   2016.MicrosoftMicrosoft went public for  $21 per share in 1986. $5,000   would be enough to buy 238 shares. After nine splits, you would   own 34,272 shares, which would be worth $1.99 million. You would   also be earning over $53,000 in dividends per year.Microsoft's core business was built on providing an   easy-to-use OS for IBM-compatible PC clones throughout the 1980s   and 1990s. That product, Windows, quickly became a unifying OS   for the fragmented hardware market, and gave Microsoft a firm   foundation to launch additional products like Office and Internet   Explorer. Between 1997 and 2007, the year the first iPhone was   introduced, Microsoft's annual revenue rose from $8.7 billion to    $51.1 billion.However, Microsoft missed the crucial technological shift   toward mobile devices, where it fell woefully behind Apple and   Google. The fragmentation of the Windows and Office markets,   caused by users who didn't upgrade their ""good enough"" software,   then throttled the tech giant's top line growth. Today's   Microsoft is still struggling to grow its top line, but its   aggressive shift toward mobile-first, cloud-first solutions with   the universal Windows Store, Azure, Cortana, and Bing are   gradually getting the company back on track.Image source: Microsoft.CiscoCisco went public for $18 per share in  1990. You could   have bought 277 shares, which would have been split  9 times   into 79,776 shares. That position would be worth nearly $2.5   million today, and be paying out $83,000 in annual dividends.Cisco was a darling of the dot-com boom, surging to a   split-adjusted $79 per share in March 2000. Investors, seemingly   enamored with the notion that the networking company's routers   and switches would link up everything in the world, bid the   stock's P/E ratio up to over 200 by the end of 2000.That ratio proved unsustainable for Cisco, which only grew its   net income by  35% in 2000, and the stock plunged to about   $12 the following year. Since then, Cisco has evolved into a   mature tech stock which is owned for income instead of explosive   growth. With its core markets routers and switch markets being   heavily commoditized, Cisco has pivoted toward higher-growth   markets like cybersecurity, service provider video, and   collaboration solutions in recent years.The key takeawayPast performance never guarantees future returns, but the   growth stories of Apple, Microsoft, and Cisco show just how much   patience pays off. If you had sold these stocks after they   doubled or tripled, you would have missed out on the massive   gains that came decades later. Therefore, never underestimate the   potential of a seemingly small $5,000 investment toeventuallymake you a millionaire.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

3 Tech Stocks That Just Got a Big Cash Payday;11/11/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's still not clear how the victory of Donald Trump will impact tech stocks. But given that the GOP will have control of both houses of Congress, there should be little doubt that we will see some major changes.Source:Gage Skidmore via Wikimedia (Modified)For example, there could be more friction and difficulties with trade. Let's face it, companies likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) have global ecosystems for logistics and manufacturing.makeArticleAd();Oh, and then there is the issue of antitrust. Already Donald Trump has indicated his displeasure withAT&T Inc.'s (NYSE:T) proposed acquisition ofTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). Might this mean he'll be more of an activist? If so, there could certainly be a dampening in tech, which has already seen lots of dealmaking.Yet there is one area where the impact of Donald Trump on tech stocks could be the most impactful: taxes. Over the years, tech companies have stashed substantial amounts overseas to take advantage of low-cost tax havens. But as for Donald Trump, he wants to bring back the capital - such as by levying only a 10% rate.While it's unclear the amounts that are overseas, it does look like it isover $2 trillion. It's also important to note thatstudies have shownthat repatriation programs often result in mostly dividend payouts and share buybacks.Again, all this is not to somehow imply that change will be immediate. When it comes to tax law, the process can be grinding. But in light of the fact that Donald has shown a penchant for savvy tax planning with his own businesses, it would not be surprising that he'd give priority to repatriation.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017OK then, what are some of the tech stocks that could benefit? Well, here's a look at three:Tech Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashOf course, AAPL has the biggest hoard of overseas cash, with a whopping$238 billion. This represents 40% of the overall market cap.So if Apple could bring back the cash, a good first move would be to boost the dividend, which is at a paltry 2.1%. There would also be lots of firepower left for aggressive share buybacks.And what about M&A? The company has a history of avoiding dealmaking. But going forward, this may change. AAPL could use its cash hoard to move aggressively into categories like social media, streaming video, machine learning and perhaps even cloud computing for the enterprise.Yet even if the company does not do such things, it may not matter anyway. The fact is that the iPhone franchise still remains an extremely powerful business. It should continue to provide lush cash flows for some time to come, as AAPL stock has significant competitive advantages, such as a premium global brand, a network of retail stores and a robust ecosystem of suppliers and developers.Of course, the blunders ofSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) with its own Galaxy Note smartphone should also be a spur of demand for Apple products. The timing is also especially propitious, since it comes during the all-important holiday season.Tech Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has been on a roll lately, with the stock up over 20% since late June. For the most part, CEO Satya Nadella has been savvy with his big bet on cloud computing. He has also made tough decisions, such as to write off the disastrousNokia Corp(ADR)(NYSE:NOK) acquisition.But hey, if there is repatriation, MSFT could get another nice boost. Keep in mind that the company has about $110 billion in overseas accounts. So yes, Microsoft may want to boost the dividend, which is currently yielding about 2.7%.But M&A is also likely to be critical. Already, MSFT has been making bold deals, as seen with the $26.2 billion acquisition ofLinkedIn Corp(NYSE:LNKD). But at the same time, the company will likely need to continue to make substantial capital investments for its cloud infrastructure.And the market opportunity is massive. According to research fromMorgan Stanley, the global spending in this category is expected to jump from$70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019.9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in     the Long RunSomething else: MSFT is already the No. 2 player in the market and will continue to benefit from the synergies with franchise assets like Windows, Office and server platforms.Tech Stocks to Buy: Cisco (CSCO)Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) has roughly $62 billion in cash in offshore accounts. This comes to about 40% of the market cap.Interestingly enough, CSCO already sports an attractive dividend yield of 3.3%. But hey, why not make it more?No doubt, M&A is something that is part of the DNA of the company. So having billions more to play with will definitely be a big advantage. CSCO has been targeting growth categories like cloud computing, mobile and security.But for investors, the real attraction for the stock is that the core networking business is likely to see long-term growth. According to thecompany's research, the amount of mobile traffic is forecast to surge by 8X from 2015 to 2020, representing a 53% compound annual growth rate. Just some of the drivers include mega-trends like streaming video, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the Internet of Things.Yet this does not mean that CSCO will get wild with its cash. For the most part, the company has remained disciplined with its costs, as seen with the recent 7% workforce reduction. CSCO has also been shedding various non-core businesses, which has helped to streamline operations and bring better focus to the growth opportunities.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his owntax   preparation firm.

3 Stocks Where You Don’t Have To Settle For Average Yields (CSCO, IP, ABBV);11/11/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsQuick, what's 0.19% of $3.6 trillion? I'll give you a hint:   that's how much, on average, passively ""managed"" mutual fund   giantVanguard Groupcollects in management fees annually. Since Vanguard is not a   publicly traded entity, the actual revenue numbers are held   pretty close to the vest.But the math comes out to be $6.8 billion in fees based on the   average Vanguard fund expense ratio of 0.19%.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');So, while the fund company prides itself on being shareholder   owned, and pounds the table on passing value to the investor,   make no mistake, Vanguard is a business and a profitable one at   that. And whileVanguard founder John Bogle is nowhere close to being a Wall   Street fat cat, his tenure at the company made him an incredibly   wealthy man by most standards.The other day while driving in to work, I listened to an   interview with Mr. Bogle on Bloomberg radio, as always,   trumpeting his case for cheap, passive index investing. He   complained, like most of us, of the low-rate, low-growth   environment. He said that the stock market is overvalued with a   forward P/E of 20-plus (most estimates put it closer to 18),   dividend yields barely around 2%, and U.S. economic growth under   2%.According to him, the best solution for investors is to - drum   roll please - put their money in a low-cost index fund.   Shocker.Now, I do agree with Mr. Bogle that yields are terribly low,   and there's no argument that U.S. economic growth is anemic at   best. Is the market overvalued? Like always, some parts are and   some aren't. But that doesn't mean investors should just accept a   broad-brush vision and settle as Mr. Bogle would have them.Above-market earnings growth and S&P-beating dividend   yields are out there. They're not even that hard find.7 CEOs That Are Heading to the Chopping Block       by 2018Here are three well known stocks that qualify.Cisco Systems, Inc.(CSCO)As the ""Internet of Things"" quietly grows, the world's   pre-eminent computer-networking hardware company surfs the same   wave. Looking in the rearview mirror, CSCO has grown earnings per   share (EPS) at a consistent average annual rate of 7.1% while   boosting their cash dividend an average of 35% per year. Going   forward, EPS is expected to grow an average of 10% annually over   the next two fiscal years. CSCO shares are currently priced at   around $31 with a forward P/E of 12.7 and a 3.37% dividend   yield.International Paper Co(IP)Having pivoted from free sheet paper to higher margin packaging   products, IP remains a key player in the rise of the emerging   middle-class long game. Despite the lack of visibility for global   economic growth, IP has delivered solid 5-year EPS growth of 29%   annually. Dividend growth has been equally impressive with a   13.2% average annual growth rate for the same time period. The   two-year forecast is equally optimistic, with anticipated average   annual earnings growth of 34%. IP shares trade around $44 with a   forward PE of 13.3 and a dividend yield of 4.16%.AbbVie, Inc(ABBV)Formerly the traditional research-driven, pharmaceutical side ofAbbot Laboratories(ABT), AbbVie has posted solid results since the split. 5-year   average annual earnings growth has clocked in at 28.16% with the   dividend growing at a 40% annual clip for the same stretch.   Looking forward two years, projections call for average annual   EPS growth of 33.5%. ABBV trades close to $62 with a 12.28   forward P/E and a 4.18% dividend yield.Risks To Consider:Despite my optimism and the compelling numbers these three   companies have delivered, all three face significant economic   headwinds. ABBV is experiencing difficulties with the obvious   regulatory stagnation caused by Obamacare, IP needs real economic   and consumer growth, and Cisco has a heavy reliance on capital   spending which is often hard to find. However, all three   companies do have solid franchises, world class cash flow, and   consistent operating results in the current climate.7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire       GrowthAction To Take:Combined, all three stocks have 5-year average annual EPS growth   of over 21%, 2-year forward earnings growth of 25.8%, and a   combined average dividend yield of about 4%. This combination of   metrics could result in capital appreciation north of 17%,   resulting in a total return in excess of 20%. Sure, throwing it   all in an index fund is cheaper and easier. But higher returns   are always worth the work.P.S.Looking for your ultimate 'Forever Stocks' for 2017 (and beyond)?   Buy them. Forget about them.Let them make you a fortune.

Facebook, Inc.'s Q3 Earnings in 10 Wild Metrics;11/10/2016;"WhileFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) stock fell about 5% after its earnings release last   week, the underlying results were actually quite impressive.   Indeed, it was likely management's reference to ambitious   investment plans in 2017 that weighed on the stock -- not the   company's actual performance during the quarter.Looking past worries about Facebook's plans for significant   investments next year, here are 10 insightful facts revealed in   the social network's earnings report.makeArticleAd();Image source: The Motley Fool.56%: Facebook's top-line growth continued at a mind-boggling pace,   up 56% from the year-ago quarter.59%: Facebook's core advertising business, which accounts for about   97% of the social network's total revenue, is firing on all   cylinders, up 59% compared with the year-ago quarter.70%: Advertising revenue coming from mobile devices was up a   whopping 70% year over year, hitting $5.7 billion. Mobile ad   revenue now accounts for about 84% of Facebook's total   revenue.$7 billion: This is the revenue Facebook brought in during Q3. Not only is   this figure above analysts' consensus estimate for third-quarter   revenue of about $6.9 billion, but it's also simply staggering in   its own right. Seven billion dollars in third-quarter revenue   puts Facebook at an annualized revenue run rate of $28 billion --   just shy ofNike's annual revenue of $33 billion and aboveMcDonald'sand its annual revenue of about $25 billion.166%: Facebook isn't the typical growth tech company with nice   top-line growth and paltry earnings. In fact, Facebook's   third-quarter net income was up 166% from the year-ago quarter,   easily outpacing revenue growth during this same period.45%: Highlighting Facebook's notable operating leverage, the   company's third-quarter operating margin hit 45%, up from 32% in   the year-ago quarter.$2.39 billion: Combining rapid revenue growth with an expanding operating   margin, Facebook is now reporting significant quarterly profits.   Third-quarter net income hit $2.38 billion, up from 896 million   in the year-ago quarter.1.79 billion: Facebook's monthly active users on its core social network   increased 16% year over year, hitting 1.79 billion. Further   highlighting growth in Facebook's engaged user base is a 17%   year-over-year jump in daily active users, putting daily active   users at a remarkable 1.18 billion in Q3.Image source: Facebook.1,000: Facebook's October launch ofWorkplace, a platform aimed at enterprise collaboration and positioned to   compete head-to-head with Slack,Cisco's Jabber, and other enterprise collaboration solutions, is off   to a running start. The company has already enlisted 1,000   organizations for Workplace and is ""adding more all the time,""   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the third-quarter   earnings call.500,000: Facebook's photo-sharing social network, Instagram, is   officially a strong business in its own right. Management said   the platform now has over 500,000 active advertisers.Despite concerns about Facebook's plans for an ""aggressive   investment year"" in 2017, the company's underlying performance   remains exceptional. Sure, year-over-year revenue growth rates   are bound to come down in the coming quarters as Facebook goes up   against tough year-ago comparisons, but if there's a time for   Facebook to be investing heavily in growth opportunities, it's   now; Facebook's execution recently has simply been astounding.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,   but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:   There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets   and the coming revolution in technology.

Better Buy: Qualcomm Inc vs. Broadcom Ltd.;11/9/2016;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) andBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) are two semiconductor giants that grew much larger   through acquisitions over the past few years. But those   acquisitions also dramatically altered the business models of   both companies, and investors who haven't been following these   chipmakers might be surprised by their new strategies.Image source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();What do Qualcomm and Broadcom do?Qualcomm, the largest mobile chipmaker in the world, generates   most of its revenue from SoCs (system on chips), which combine   application processors, GPUs, and baseband modems for smartphones   and tablets. But its patent licensing business, which charges   OEMs licensing fees for every 3G/4G device sold, generates the   lion's share of its profits.To offset slowing sales of smartphones and strengthen its   patent portfolio, Qualcomm expanded into adjacent markets with   big acquisitions, including wireless chipset maker Atheros in   2011, IoT (Internet of Things) chipmaker CSR in 2015, and itsplanned purchaseofNXP Semiconductors, the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world.Broadcom once competed against Qualcomm in the mobile   application processor and baseband modem markets. But tough   competition forced Broadcom to leave both markets and pivot   toward radios for consumer devices and chips for data center   networking equipment. Avago, a maker of analog and mixed-signal   chips, acquired Broadcom earlier this year and assumed Broadcom's   name.The ""new"" Broadcomsubsequently soldits IoT business toCypress Semiconductor(NASDAQ: CY) , and recently announced its plans to buy networking   equipment vendorBrocade(NASDAQ: BRCD) . That deal will make Broadcom one of the three   largest FC (fiber channel) equipment vendors in the  world   alongsideCiscoandCavium.Qualcomm's strengths and weaknessesQualcomm's chipmaking business faces several major headwinds   -- slowing demand for smartphones worldwide, its loss of market   share to cheaper rivals likeMediaTek, and the development of first-party ARM chips by leading OEMs   likeApple,Huawei, and Xiaomi.Qualcomm's licensing business also faces defiant OEMs and   regulators, which claim that its fees are too high compared to   the low margins of the smartphone industry. It was already forced   to lower those fees  in China last year. Those pressures   caused Qualcomm's revenue and earnings to respectively fall 7%   and 5% last year.However, Qualcomm's new high-end Snapdragon chips, its   aggressive expansion into adjacent markets, and new licensing   agreements with OEMs (especially in China) are expected to lift   its revenue by 1% and earnings by 7% this year. Closing the NXP   deal earlier would significantly boost those year-over-year   comparisons.Broadcom's strengths and weaknessesOver 10% of Broadcom's revenue comes from Apple . Prior to   merging, Avago supplied power amplifier modules for iPhones and   iPads, while Broadcom supplied touchscreen controllers and   combo-radios. This means that if sales Apple's iDevices continue   falling, Broadcom's wireless business (27% of last quarter's   revenues) could take a hit.However, Broadcom estimates that the unit will post 30%   sequential growth in the current quarter on the strength of its   unnamed ""North American smartphone customer"" (most likely Apple).   Meanwhile, Broadcom's wired infrastructure business (54% of   revenues) will likely keep growing on robust demand for    switching, routing, and fiber optic solutions. Its   industrial segment, which includes an IP licensing business, also   posted double-digit annual sales growth last quarter.Broadcom's softest spot is its enterprise storage business,   which reported a 10% annual sales decline last quarter due to   general weakness in the data storage market. But looking ahead,   analysts expect Broadcom to post 94% sales growth this year   (inflated by merging with Avago), and 23% growth in 2017. On the   bottom line, Broadcom's earnings are expected to rise 25% this   year and 20% next year.Buybacks and dividendsOver the past 12 months, Qualcomm spent $3.3 billion on   buybacks and $3 billion on dividends, compared to its free cash   flow of $6.9 billion during that period. However, Qualcomm funded   most of thosebuybacks with debt, and it's unclear how  its $47 billion purchase of NXP will   impact that strategy in the future. Qualcomm currently pays a   forward dividend yield of 3.2%. It's likely to keep raising that   dividend annually, as it has done so for the past 13 years.Broadcom generated $2 billion in free cash flow over the past   12 months, but it spent just $272 million on buybacks and $653   million on dividends. It also pays a much lower forward yield of   1.2%. Broadcom has raised that dividend annually for the past six   years.The valuations and verdictQualcomm trades at 20 times earnings, which is slightly lower   than the industry average of 22 for the broad line semiconductor   companies. Broadcom's P/E is negative due to the costs of the   merger, but it trades at 13 times forward earnings compared to   Qualcomm's forward P/E of 14.It's a close call between the two chipmakers, but I believe   that Qualcomm's higher dividend, more generous buybacks, and its   purchase of NXP put it in a better position to grow than   Broadcom. However, Broadcom's well-diversified business, lower   valuation, and solid top and bottom line growth still make it a   solid long-term semiconductor play.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

5 Takeaways From Barrick Gold's Q3 Earnings;11/6/2016;"Barrick Gold(NYSE: ABX) recently reported Q3 earnings. Reporting earnings per   share -- adjusted for non-recurring costs -- of $0.24, the   company exceeded analysts' expectations of  $0.19 per share.   But there's much more to a company's quarterly performance than   just one number, so let's dig in and mine the report for some of   the more interesting nuggets.Image source: Getty Images.Spilling the beans on the spillFollowing a request from the Argentine government, Barrick   Goldsuspendedoperations at its Veladero mine -- one of its five core mines --   on Sept. 15 because of process solution that spilled from the   leach pad. The company resumed operations on Oct. 4, having   conducted extensive water monitoring to confirm there was no   environmental impact. In addition, Barrick implemented measures   to help ensure that a similar event would not occur again.makeArticleAd();Because of both the suspension of operations and adverse   weather conditions, management revised Veladero's operating   guidance down for 2016. Gold production at Veladero is now   expected to fall between 530,000 and 580,000 ounces for   fiscal 2016 -- down about 9% from the previous guidance of   580,000 to 640,000. All-in sustaining costs (AISCs) have,   likewise, been affected; management now estimates AISCs to be   between $800 and $870 per gold ounce at Veladero -- up from   the previous range of $790 to $860 per ounce.What's the deal with debt?Making a concerted effort to strengthen its balance sheet,   Barrick reduced its debt by approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal   2015. With a debt-reduction target of $2 billion for fiscal 2016,   the company reduced it by $968 million through the first half of   the year and by another $461 million during the third   quarter.Planning to dip into both some of the $2.65 billion in cash it   has on hand and some of the operating cash flow it generates in   the fourth quarter, Barrick is confident it will achieve its   debt-reduction target for the year.With current outstanding debt of $8.5 billion, the company is   looking to further strengthen its balance sheet, setting in a   medium-term goal of reducing its debt to below $5   billion. Acknowledging the company's success in improving   its balance sheet,Moody'sand S&P both upgraded their outlooks on Barrick's credit   rating.Operation: digitizationIn the third quarter, Barrick announced that it will be   partnering withCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) in an attempt to ""drive the digital reinvention of   [its] business.""Image source: Barrick Gold corporate website.Of the $100 million earmarked for digital projects in 2016 and   2017, management has budgeted $50 million to be used in the first   wave of digital projects at its Cortez mine in Nevada. But Cortez   won't be alone in making use of the new technology. Further   demonstrating its commitment to the safety and security of   Veladero, Barrick will make the Argentine mine a trial site   for digital technology that will improve upon its   environmental and water monitoring activities.Identifying the intended benefits of digitizing its   enterprise, management claims that it will help ""us grow our cash   flow per share by enhancing productivity and efficiency at our   mines, and improving decision-making and performance across our   business."" It's not just mines currently producing gold, where   Barrick sees an opportunity for digitization. It is also working   to apply the digital technologies to help streamline the   permitting process.Going with the flowBesides debt reduction, Barrick achieved another of its other   priorities: free cash flow growth. Generating more in the third   quarter -- $674 million -- than the first two quarters of fiscal   2016 combined, Barrick has generated $1.13 billion in free cash   flow through the first nine months of 2016. Perhaps this in and   of itself doesn't mean much, so let's compare it with the two   previous years: In fiscal 2014, it reported negative-$136   million; in fiscal 2015, it reported $471 million.The company's ability to grow its free cash flow speaks to how   well it has able to rein in spending. For the first nine months   of fiscal 2015, Barrick reported $2.1 billion in operational cash   flow, while it reported a comparable $1.9 billion for the same   period in 2016. The difference between the two years reflects how   well Barrick has been able to control capital expenditures.   Whereas Barrick reported $1.4 billion in capex through the first   nine months of 2015, it reported only $800 million for the same   period in 2016.The lowdown on low costsEarlier this year, during an investor presentation in   February, management targeted AISCs to fall between $775 and $825   per gold ounce for fiscal 2016.Image source: Barrick Gold corporate website.For the third consecutive quarter, management revised this   range, providing improved costs guidance. It's now forecasting   AISCs to fall between $740 and $775 per gold ounce.Largely attributing the reduction in costs to ""a positive   change in [its] sales mix as a result of the divestment of [its]   high-cost mine sites,"" Barrick reported AISCs of $704 per gold   ounce for Q3. The higher proportion of sales coming from   lower-cost operations didn't just positively affect Q3, it's   benefited the first half of the year as well. In fact, through   the first nine months of fiscal 2016, Barrick's AISC equal $730   per gold ounce -- a 15.7% improvement over the $866 it reported   for the same period in fiscal 2015.The takeawayContinuing to execute its debt-reduction strategy and   commitment to free cash flow growth are just two of the reasons   Barrick -- and its investors -- could consider the third quarter   a success. It also demonstrates why the company is one of the   more compelling opportunities for those looking to make some   green from companies producing gold.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,   but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:   There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets   and the coming revolution in technology.

3D Systems' (DDD) Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Shares Soar;11/3/2016;"Continuing its volatile earnings history,3D Systems CorporationDDDposted another incredible earnings beat in its third-quarter 2016 results. The company reported adjusted earnings (including share-based compensation expense) of 9 cents per share for the quarter, miles ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of breakeven earnings.Shares climbed nearly 9% in the aftermath of the results, as investors cheered the company's year-over-year earnings growth.The company posted a GAAP loss of 19 cents per share, much narrower than the loss of 29 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Decent revenue growth, driven by robust growth in software and healthcare solutions, boosted the company's earnings. Lower administrative expenses further bolstered the bottom line.Inside the HeadlinesThe 3D printer maker reported revenues of $156.4 million for the quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.2%. The top line benefited from robust demand for the company's software and health care solutions, as well as higher 3D printers and materials orders from industrial clients. However, a consistent challenging operating environment and lower demand for 3D printers and on-demand manufacturing restricted top-line growth to some extent.Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $162 million by a small margin.Adjusted gross margin for the quarter expanded 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 51%, helped by the company's shift from consumer products to materials, software and healthcare solutions, which carry higher margins.Also, the company's operating expenses plunged drastically (down 13.9%) to $91 million, as SG&A (down 22%) expenses fell significantly on lower amortization and legal expenses. R&D expense (up 16.4%) increased year over year only due to a non-recurring asset write-off charge.Despite challenging growth conditions, 3D Systems continues to focus on expanding its market share and exploring diverse market opportunities. Its recent partnerships with two major healthcare companies to expand its Simbionix training product line for women will fortify its competitive position in the healthcare market and drive results.In fact, the quarter saw 3D Systems forge an important partnership with PTC. This alliance will see the two leaders joining forces to integrate 3D Systems' 3D Sprint SDK into PTC's flagship Creo CAD platform. This will, in turn, deliver seamless CAD-to-print functionality to Creo users, in addition to an entire set of print management tools. Further, the leading 3D printing player launched its 3DXpert software for direct metal 3D printing.During the quarter, 3D Systems released the Geomagic Control X software for 3D inspection and metrology - an easy-to-use solution that meets the measurement analysis requirements of manufacturers globally. The leading 3D printing player also launched its 3DXpert software for direct metal 3D printing. In addition, the company undertook operational restructuring initiatives like improving the sales network as well as undertaking lean manufacturing initiatives in supply-chain operations.Particularly, precision healthcare offerings like printers and materials, surgical simulation and planning and printing of devices and tools contributed to growth. This apart, the company's other four growth channels, namely expansion of quickparts services, accelerating 3D printer penetration through channel expansion, launch of integrated 3D authoring solutions platform and strengthening of partnerships proved conducive to the company's operations.3D Systems is committed to channelizing its resources toward more profitable markets. 3D Systems recently announced its decision to cease the production of Cube, the entry-level consumer 3D printer. Although it might hurt revenues in the short term, we believe that it will direct the company's resources toward higher-margin products, and accelerate next-generation capabilities and thus enhance profitability over the long run.Cash Flow and Balance Sheet3D Systems ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $179.4 million, up from $157.5 million a year back. For the first nine months of 2016, cash generated from operating activities came in at $38.2 million, as against cash used in operating activities of $10.6 million in the comparable period last year.3D SYSTEMS CORP Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise3D SYSTEMS CORP Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|3D   SYSTEMS CORP QuoteTo ConcludeOver the past few quarters, 3D Systems has been experiencing unfavorable broader market conditions that have badly hit its financial performance. The company has been grappling with strong volatility in macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability. These conditions continue to affect the company's performance.However, the company is taking initiatives to channelize its resources into more lucrative areas in professional and industrial markets. 3D Systems also conducted numerous successful product launches and strategic deals, which could aid the company to combat these persistent challenges in the near future.Also, 3D Systems' healthcare business continues to gain traction, driven by rising demand from customers who print medical and dental devices. The company is also focusing on enhancing its existing 3D printers' line, reinforcing partnerships and boosting productivity.3D Systems presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the sector include Adobe Systems Inc.,ADBE, InterDigital, Inc.IDCCand Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCO. All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Adobe Systems is a leading player in the computer software space. The company has a striking earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates all through, for an average beat of 5.6%.InterDigital develops and markets advanced digital wireless telecommunications systems, using proprietary technologies for voice and data communications. The company has a good earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice for an average positive surprise of 30%.Cisco Systems is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet, and provides the broadest line of solutions for transporting data, voice and video.

2 Companies That Protect the Internet of Things;11/2/2016;"The Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of wearables,   smart appliances, connected cars, and other gadgets, is widely   hyped as the ""next big thing"" in technology. Networking giantCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) estimates that the number of connected devices   worldwide will double from 25 billion in 2015 to  50 billion   in 2020.However, the IoT's rapid growth was also recently implicated   in a series of DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks which   affected over 80 popular websites worldwide. DDoS attacks occur   when hackers use botnets (a network of compromised computers) to   flood sites with so much traffic that they crash. Dyn DNS, the   internet traffic management company which was hit by the attacks,   believes that poorly secured smart devices like  webcams,   surveillance cameras, and thermostats were all hijacked to carry   out the attacks.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.In the past, it was mostly PCs that were turned into ""bots""   for DDoS attacks. But since most IoT devices don't run   traditional security software, they can be more easily hacked and   converted into bots . That glaring weakness should boost demand   for dedicated IoT security solutions, which could be a boon for   companies likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andSymantec(NASDAQ: SYMC) in the near future.How Cisco protects the IoTAs one of the world's top networking equipment companies,   Cisco is already well-poised to profit from a more connected   world. But its security business also plays a key role in   thwarting attacks against its customers. These solutions include   cloud-based threat analysis, advanced malware protection, network   and perimeter security solutions, physical safety and security   solutions, and IP-based dispatch and incident response   systems.Cisco's security portfolio was mainly built through   acquisitions. Buying SourceFire and  ThreatGRID a few years   ago formed the foundations of its next-gen firewall and threat   prevention business. Additional purchases like OpenDNS,   Portcullis, Lancope, and CloudLock further strengthened that   business, which accounted for 4% of Cisco's top line last year.   That percentage might seem small, but the unit's 13% sales growth   outpaced the growth at all of Cisco's other main business   segments.Back in March, Cisco acquired Jasper, a cloud-based IoT    platform, for $1.4 billion. By merging its networking,   security, and IoT portfolios together, Cisco offers compelling   product bundles which tackle both traditional cyberattacks and   newer IoT-based ones. Its massive free cash flow ($12.4 billion   over the past 12 months) also ensures that it can keep gobbling   up smaller security and IoT firms to become a main security   player for a hyper-connected world.How Symantec protects the IoTSymantec, best known as the creator of Norton Antivirus, sells   security products for PCs, data centers, and emails. Through its$4.65 billion acquisitionof Blue Coat earlier this year, Symantec also gained security   solutions for networks and cloud services. Symantec claims that   bundling these services in end-to-end packages will enable it to   protect a wide range of platforms which would normally require   ""eight to ten"" different security vendors.Symantec is addressing the growing IoT security issues in two   main ways. First, it's helping IoT device makers build more   secure IoT devices. Symantec advises these  companies on   implementing device authentication through SSL (secure sockets   layer), digital code signing, endpoint protection, over-the-air   updates, and built-in analytics. Second, it uses eight new ""Roots   of Trust"" optimized for  IoT devices. These ""roots"", like   SSL authorization, authenticate devices and let them communicate   with other trusted devices. By blocking access from unsecured   devices, Symantec can prevent them from being hacked and   converted into bots.Like Cisco, Symantec will likely keep growing its portfolio   through acquisitions. Both Cisco and Symantec have been named as   potential suitors for threat detection firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) . FireEye notably has a partnership with   ForeScout, which detects unknown objects on networks to counter   IoT-based attacks.90% of IT networks could be at riskBack in 2014, IDC predicted that a whopping 90% of all IT   networks will have experienced an  IoT-based security breach   by Dec. 2016. The Mirai botnet which  wreaked havoc across   the IoT in late October indicates that estimate could be   conservative, and that demand for more robust solutions from   companies like Cisco and Symantec will keep growing.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Pitney Bowes (PBI) Misses Q4 Earnings, Reiterates Guidance;11/1/2016;"Pitney Bowes Inc.PBIreported third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 44 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents by 6.4%.However, on a year-over-year basis, adjusted earnings improved 2.3%.The bottom-line improvement is attributable to lower tax rate during the quarter.

Also, an exit from direct operations in Mexico, South Africa and five markets in Asia aggravated the decline in revenues. Furthermore, weak sales across all three segments of the company added to Pitney Bowes' woes.As for the segments, on a reported basis,Small and Medium Business(""SMB"") Solutions revenues slipped 7% year over year to $426 million. Softness in North American Mailing business (down 7%) and International Mailing Business (down 9%) were attributable to soft equipment sales. Also, recurring revenue streams decline in both the segments worsened the fall.Enterprise Business Solutions(""EBS"") revenues inched up1% over year at $220 million. This segment's production mail business grew5%on account of higher sorter, inserter and print equipment sales. However, few lower margin deals hampered Presort Services revenues (down 2%), thus offsetting the growth to some extent.TheDigital Commerce Solutionsreported 1% year-over-year fall in sales to $193 million. A fall in sales from Software solutions (down 9%) more than offset a rise in sales from global e-commerce business (up 8%), thereby driving an overall decline. Lower Customer Information Management and Location Intelligence license revenues acted as a growth dampener for the Software Solutions segment.However, the global e-commerce business continued on its usual growth trajectory, mainly driven by the Borderfree acquisition. In addition, robust outbound U.S. package shipments proved to be a major growth driver for the segment.Liquidity and Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2016, free cash flow was $119.4 million compared with $130.9 million as of Sep 30, 2015.As of Sep 30, 2016, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $992.1 million compared with $650.6 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2016, was $2,831.7 million, up from $2,489.6 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release, Pitney Bowes has reiterated its guidance. The company forecasts adjusted earnings in the range of $1.75-$1.82. Revenues are now projected to decline in the range of 1-3%.Pitney Bowes is bullish about the prospects in the fourth quarter on account of the initiatives that were taken earlier. The company anticipates that implementation of the enterprise business platform, new product introductions and consist enhancement of the channel strategy will act as key growth catalysts for the upcoming quarter.PITNEY BOWES IN Price, Consensus and EPS     SurprisePITNEY BOWES IN Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|PITNEY BOWES IN QuoteOur TakePitney Bowes reported dismal third-quarter results. Despite taking multiple measures pertaining to software business transformation, the company has been unable to generate a tangible positive impact on its software business. Also, foreign currency fluctuations and sluggish global economic conditions pose as significant headwinds. Moreover, a rise in the company's operating and marketing expenses are likely to put pressure on margins of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company in the near term.Despite these negatives, Pitney Bowes' steady transformation process over the past three years to create long-term flexibility for investment reinstates hope. Also, the company's strategic collaborations and acquisitions, diligent business pruning and focus on improving operational efficiency bode well for long-term growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the sector include Adobe Systems Inc.,ADBE, InterDigital, Inc.IDCCand Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCO.

"Check Point (CHKP) Beats Q3 Earnings and Sales; Stock Up";11/1/2016;"Shares ofCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.CHKPspiked yesterday following the company's announcement of splendid third-quarter 2016 results, wherein its revenues and earnings topped its own expectations as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.01 came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Adjusted earnings also climbed 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.On non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.13 which were not only 8.7% higher than the year-ago quarter but way ahead of its own guidance range of $1.03 to $1.10.CHECK PT SOFTW Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseCHECK PT SOFTW Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|CHECK PT SOFTW QuoteRevenuesThird-quarter revenues came in at $427.6 million, up nearly 6% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $423 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $405−$435 million (mid-point $420 million).Top-line growth was aided by sales growth of 9.6% in Products & Software Blades and 1.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 23.8% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. While the number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 65, that of customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more contributed 73% to the total order value.Geographically, the Americas contributed 49% to revenues and Europe accounted for 35%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 16%.Operating ResultsOn a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 5.9% to $377.4 million, while gross margin remained flat at 88.4%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 12.9% year over year to $167.6 million as the company continued to make investments. The increase may also be attributed to higher research and development, and selling and marketing expenses as well as to acquisitions made over the past year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 240 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $210.3 million, up nearly 1% year over year. However, margins contracted 240 bps as a percentage of revenues mainly due to higher operating expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $173.4 million or $1.01 per share, up from $171.1 million or 94 cents reported last year.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowCheck Point exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments of approximately $3.708 billion. During the first three quarters of 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $740.1 million. Moreover, during the first nine months of 2016, Check Point repurchased $739.9 million worth of common stock.OutlookFor the fourth quarter, the company provided a strong revenue and earnings guidance. It expects to generate revenues between $460 million and $490 million (mid-point $475 million). The guidance range at mid-point is slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $474.6 million.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.20 to $1.28 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be approximately 15 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.12 per share.Our TakeCheck Point Software reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results, with both its top and bottom lines marking a year-over-year improvement. The year-over-year upside in the top and bottom lines was further encouraging. Buoyed by a strong quarterly performance, the company provided a robust outlook for the fourth quarter.Moving ahead, rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. Additionally, the company's efforts on continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco Systems Inc.CSCO, Juniper Networks Inc.JNPRand Fortinet Inc.FTNT, along with an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds, remain major concerns.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

LinkedIn Corp (LNKD) Makes Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Look Savvy;10/28/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIn retrospect,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) may have timed its acquisition ofLinkedIn Corp(NYSE:LNKD) perfectly. If it had waited until after the release of its   solid third-quarter growth numbers following Thursday's closing   bell (bolstering solid second quarter growth   numbers), LNKD shares may have been priced too richly. Had it made the   deal prior tomid-June, it may not have known what it was getting.Throw in the fact that LinkedIn isalso working on a data center infrastructurethat may well give Microsoft a way to compete with the likes ofCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andJuniper Networks, Inc.(NYSE:JNPR), the acquisition may end up being even better than   anticipated.makeArticleAd();Either way, one final look at LNKD stock as a standalone name   is merited.LinkedIn EarningsFor its fiscal third quarter of the year, LinkedIn earned   $1.18 per share on $960 million worth of revenue. The top line   was slightly better than the expected $959 million, but the   bottom line trounced expectations for a profit of only 91 cents   per share of LNKD stock. Revenue was up 23% year-over-year, while   per-share operating earnings grew 51%, extending what's become a   very respectable growth trend.Memberships at the professional networking site grew as well.   LinkedIn membership grew by 17 million to 467 million accounts   during the quarter in question, up 18% on a year-over-year   basis.7 Growth Stocks That Should Replace Apple in       Your PortfolioPerhaps more important, LinkedIn swung to a GAAP profit. Net   income of $9.1 million was the first quarterly profit the company   has turned in over a year, and marks a wide turnaround from the   $46.9 million loss it booked for the third quarter of 2015.CEO Jeff Weiner commented ""In Q3, continued product   investments across our platform drove another quarter of strong   engagement and financial performance. As we look forward, our   combination with Microsoft creates the opportunity for us to   dramatically increase the impact and scale with which we deliver   value to our members and customers.""Between the trajectory LinkedIn is on and the potential   synergies a pairing of it and Microsoft could foster, MSFT   investors have a lot to be smiling about today … even more   knowing the $26.2 billion price tag is locked in regardless of   how much more valuable LinkedIn may have just proved it was.Another Reason MSFT Stock Owners Should Smile?While the synergies between a business-oriented LinkedIn and   productivity-oriented Microsoft are clear, one has to wonder if   there was more to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's decision to   purchase LNKD than just the leverage he could apply to LinkedIn's   membership.Although it's not a secret per se, the work LinkedIn had been   doing in the arena was secretive. That work? Rather than purchase   an off-the-shelf hardware from names like Juniper and Cisco - and   be relatively beholden to their architecture and pricing -   LinkedIn hasopted to develop its own data center   architecture.While LinkedIn's project director Ali Kahn says the effort is   not for commercial purposes but rather to put LNKD in charge of   the experience it delivers, the fact is, this home-grown   solution, which can be implemented at a fraction of the normal   cost, presents a compelling possibility for Microsoft … even if   only to use for itself.The Last Word on LNKD StockMSFT is still paying something of a fortune for LinkedIn,   offering $196 in cash per share of LNKD stock as part of the deal   that is expected to be closed before the end of the year.   LinkedIn has only generated $3.43 billion in revenue for the past   twelve months, and only turned a minimal GAAP profit in the most   recent of its last four quarters.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Just Getting       StartedIt's not where LinkedIn is that really matters, however. It's   where it's going. And where it's going is pretty impressive on   its own.As of the latest look, LinkedIn was on pace to grow operating   earnings by 34% this year on a 26% growth rate in revenue. Next   year's earnings per share of LNKD (pre-merger) are projected to   be up 22% on a 20% improvement in sales, And, bear in mind   LinkedIn has a strong history of beats for the top and bottom   line.MSFT shareholders have a lot to look forward to, as the   impending pairing should make LinkedIn's good and improving   numbers even better.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy That       Yield 4% or More7 Top Stocks to Buy for Months of Red-Hot       ReturnsThe postLinkedIn Corp (LNKD) Makes Microsoft Corporation   (MSFT) Look Savvyappeared first onInvestorPlace."

9 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now;10/28/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn an uncertain market there's a lot to be said for having a firm foundation ofdividend stocksfor your portfolio. A good income play at a good price isn't quite as sexy as a roaring momentum stock, but over the long-term, the reliable returns from dividends really add up.Source:401(K) 2012 via Flickr (Modified)Every investor needs to be biased toward income stocks right now - even if they are at or near retirement, and looking to take some risk off the table. After all, current yields are about 1.8% on T-Notes and just under 2.2% on investment-grade corporates.makeArticleAd();Where else are you going to get income?If you want stability, then well-priced dividend stocks will provide a great backbone for your portfolio in 2017. And if you're looking for income, you have to remember that even conservative bond funds still have interest rate risk and could lose principle value if and when the Federal Reserve raises rates in the coming month.In short, there's no better place to put your money than dividend stocks right now.7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy That Yield     4% or MoreHere are nine great picks to consider:Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Seagate Technology (STX)Sector:Technology2016 Performance:-7% year-to-date vs. +4% for the S&P 500Market Cap:$10 billionCurrent Yield:7.4%Seagate Technology PLC(NYSE:STX) is one of the largest hard drive manufacturers in the world. Some investors are leery of a PC-focused business like Seagate, but while the stock has flopped considerably from its 2014 highs, it remains fairly valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 10 and continues to hang tough in this mobile age.That bargain P/E comes even as Seagate has rallied strongly lately. Shares of STX bottomed at under $20 in mid-2016 and have been steadily on the march through the second half of the year. That momentum bodes very well for 2017.But more importantly, who cares if the lion's share of the gains are behind us when Seagate is such an income powerhouse? STX is one of the biggest dividend plays on Wall Street, with its 63-cent payout each quarter equaling a roughly 7.3% yield right now. And since the dividend is about 68% of next year's earnings, it is very secure and not at risk of a cut.Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Sector:Technology2016 Performance:13%Market Cap:$148 billionCurrent Yield:3.4%Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) is not the tech powerhouse it once was, but value investors can still find a lot to like in this enterprise technology leader.Chuck Robbins took over from longtime leader John Chambers as CEO in mid-2015, and he has already started reshaping the company to be more agile. Although revenue is only set to grow by single digits in 2017, earnings per share will jump 13%. This is in part thanks to efficiencies that include the painful decision to lay off20% of its workforcethis summer.Furthermore, while top-line growth isn't burning down the house, there is assuredly good growth ahead in the dividends of CSCO stock. Its payout has surged more than fourfold in five years, from just 6 cents a quarter in 2011 to 26 cents currently. Even now, the payouts are highly sustainable at less than half next year's earnings.7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to     RichesLooking forward, Cisco continues to reshape its company via acquisitions including six deals in 2016 across everything from semiconductor designers to data center managers to cloud computing companies. This will position the company very nicely for success in the new year and beyond.Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Caterpillar (CAT)Sector:Industrials2016 Performance:24%Market Cap:$48 billionCurrent Yield:3.7%You may think it's silly to consider any stock that has run up more than 20% in a year as a ""value"" play. But when you compare current pricing ofCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) versus highs of about $110 in 2011, 2012 and most recently in 2015, you can see why this company isn't exactly going like gangbusters despite recent momentum.The thing holding back CAT stock during the last few years has been commodity prices, of course. An ill-timed move into mining equipment via the 2011 acquisition ofBucyrus- at a massive premium, no less - has ruined the company's performance since then. But it looks like we've hit a bottom in commodity prices as oil and gold have stabilized after long-term declines, and that bodes well for Caterpillar.Investors piling in lately have noticed this, but more important isa 12-month target price target from Goldman Sachs at $112- up big-time from a prior target of $76 that was long overdue for revision.A 3.5% dividend and hopes of continued economic recovery could also help this heavy equipment company power even higher, but most important is the notion that the worst is over for CAT in terms of commodity prices and in terms of hangover from its snake-bitten 2011 buyout of Bucyrus.Invest with confidence here now that the worst is behind Caterpillar and momentum has returned in 2016 … even if the company still isn't quite back to where it was before.Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Sector:Financials2016 Performance:4%Market Cap:$250 billionCurrent Yield:2.8%It's rough out there for many financial stocks lately, given the lack of confidence in the financial sector since the Great Recession and the increased scrutiny by regulators and politicians. ButJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) continues to stand strong amid the headwinds, posting a string of better-than-expected earnings lately.That's admittedly thanks to cost-cutting measures, but it also helps that JPM remains the largest bank in America with over $2.3 trillion in total assets. And while JPM isn't exactly known to be squeaky clean, recent trouble atWells Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC) makes it look much more principled by comparison and could help both investor sentiment and consumer perceptions of the bank.JPMorgan is one of the best-run operations out there, weathering the financial crisis better than its peers and quickly ramping back its dividend to an attractive 2.8% yield at current pricing even though that payout remains just about one third of total earnings. The 4-cent dividend increase in 2016 was an increase of more than 9%, and long-term value investors should expect to see another move like that in 2017.The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy     NowYes, JPM had a rough start to 2016, but it recently started to get its groove back and is once again challenging its previous 52-week highs. That could mean that a breakout soon in this financial stock.Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Ventas (VTR)Sector:Real Estate2016 Performance:19%Market Cap:$24 billionCurrent Yield:4.4%Ventas, Inc.(NYSE:VTR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is capitalizing on the graying of America, and is one of the largest operators of senior living facilities in the U.S. VTR owns approximately 1,300 properties, ranging from skilled nursing facilities to specialty hospitals.While the long-term trend lifting Ventas is powerful, you won't have to wait years for the profits to transpire. VTR stock has outperformed nicely in 2016, and continues to power higher thanks to a great portfolio of properties and efficient operation.Almost half of Ventas' properties operate under the lucrative ""triple net lease"" model where tenants are responsible for paying real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance. That's a streamlined and cost-effective deal for the operator, and VTR investors have been paid back nicely via a 4.4% dividend fueled by these properties.As baby boomers age and rely on facilities from companies like Ventas to keep them healthy and active, there will only be increased demand for these kind of services in the coming years. That demographic shift makes VTR all but a sure thing no matter what turmoil strikes Wall Street in the next year or so.Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Telefonica (TEF)Sector:Telecom2016 Performance:-10%Market Cap:$49 billionCurrent yield:6.3%Spanish telecommunications giantTelefonica S.A.(ADR)(NYSE:TEF) is not just a big player in Europe, but also in Latin America.This emerging-market exposure has been a double-edged sword, though, because while it has allowed for big growth in some areas, it also has caused headaches of late. But as Latin American markets like Brazil and Argentina have put up significant outperformance since spring 2016, the future is once again bright for TEF stock.Beyond the 2017 outlook, the longer-term prospects of emerging markets remain bright as growing middle class consumers increasingly turn to cell phones and mobile technology. And while Europe itself isn't exactly going bananas, the economy on the continent has improved from the double-dip recession a few years ago. It's certainly much more stable.If you're looking for growth, in all honesty, TEF isn't going to really provide it. But with a big dividend and a fair price now that the telecom trades at just 12 times next year's earnings, this pick is a great way to add an international flavor to your dividend stocks portfolio.10 Stocks That Every Investor Should OwnThe dividend is huge, too, at 6.3%. And while foreign stocks like this have payouts that can be volatile and only pay twice a year instead of quarterly - and while you have to consider foreign taxes on dividends as well - buy-and-hold investors will assuredly be well-served by this stable European telecom amid an otherwise uncertain outlook for 2017.Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Ares Capital (ARCC)Sector:Financials2016 Performance:8%Market Cap:$5 billionCurrent Yield:9.9%Business development companies (BDCs) likeAres Capital Corporation(NASDAQ:ARCC) are popular options for investors chasing yield because these publicly traded stocks operate much like investment funds. When you buy in, you are buying their portfolio of equity and debt investments.Since ARCC has a close relationship with private equity giantAres Management LP(NYSE:ARES), that means ready-made access to financing in some big-ticket deals. And while there is always risk in these loans, both Q1 and Q2 numbers from Ares showed a marked improvement in non-performing loans compared with previous quarters.An additional plus is that Ares Capital is savvy about buying up smaller andsometimes even bigger rivals, consolidating power while debt is relatively cheap in an effort to maximize its control of the market.Shares probably won't move much, judging by the rangebound nature of this stock since 2010 after a snap-back from the Great Recession bottom. But with a yield approaching double digits, who needs share appreciation from ARCC when you can get huge dividend checks each quarter?Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Chevron (CVX)Sector:Energy2016 Performance:12%Market Cap:$195 billionCurrent yield:4.1%Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) is up 13% in 2016, fighting back nicely from its spring lows when we saw crudeoil pricesbottom at under $27. But while Chevron has been riding a recovery in oil in 2016, its outlook for 2017 remains bright.That's in part because OPEC continues to talk about production cuts in the coming months and into the New Year, but also because of serious restructuring that included laying off 12% of Chevron's workforce in the wake of lower oil prices. This OPEC move will keep oil prices firm, and the efficiencies will keep Chevron's costs low going forward.CVX also is in the middle of a largeasset saleto strengthen its balance sheet and improve its margins in the era of $50-per-barrel oil. In 2015, Chevron sold $5.7 billion in assets and its goal for 2016 and into 2017 $5 billion to $10 billion in additional cash.This will not only support the business, but also the company's nice 4.3% dividend yield.What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election?CVX is not just one of the best performers in the Dow with a double-digit return in 2016, but also one of the highest-yielding with this kind of yield. Chevron also just kept up its streak of consecutive annual dividend hikes byraising its payout, albeit by a penny per share.Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Mattel (MAT)Sector:Consumer Discretionary2016 Performance:16%Market Cap:$11 billionCurrent Yield:4.8%Surprised to see toymakerMattel, Inc.(NASDAQ:MAT) on this list? Don't be - because since Mattel began paying dividends regularly in 2011, it has boosted payouts 65% in just five years.Yes, MAT stock fell on hard times in 2014 and 2015 as it plummeted over 50% peak-to-trough in part because of its biggest brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price falling out of favor - and, of course, because it lost the right to licenseWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) princess toys. However, the company implemented aggressive cost cutting measures and is now in the middle of a turnaround that appears to be taking shape quickly.In fact, Mattel wasjust upgradedto a buy in September by Monness Crespi Hardt based on a turnaround in its core brands and better days ahead.With new products in the pipeline, Christmas could be very strong for Mattel. So don't delay and buy this dividend payer while your yield is good and before prices rise.Jeff Reevesis the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author   ofThe Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks.

Baidu Inc ADR (BIDU) Stock Has a Brighter Future Than You Think;10/28/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy most accounts,Baidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) should be down today, but it's not. BIDU stock is up, and updecidedly, gaining nearly 4% for the day so far.Source:Simone.Brunozzi Via FlickrYes, the so-called ""Google of China"" beat its earnings estimates for the recently completed third quarter. But the bar was set low - the Chinese search engine still reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue, and said things would get worse before they got better.makeArticleAd();The prod for the unlikely bullishness, then?To a small degree, hope that the headwind would be short-loved. To a larger degree, Baidu is showing growth where it really counts.Baidu EarningsLast quarter, the Chinese search engine (among other things)earned an impressive $1.49 per share, versus expectations of only $1.08 per share of Baidu stock. Non-GAAP net income was up 6.3% on a year-over-year basis, and sales of $2.74 billion topped estimates of $2.7 billion.The top line was still down almost 1%, however -  the first time in the company's history year-over-year revenue has slipped.7 Growth Stocks That Should Replace Apple in     Your PortfolioBaidu's third-quarter sales struggle is largely a reflection of new internet advertising rules. These rules were put in place by Chinese regulators earlier this year after a young man sought information about treatment options for his particular cancer using the Baidu search engine. His search yielded an advertisement that wasn't clearly identified as such, and as it turns out,may not have been his best therapy choice. His death not only sparked outrage - it prodded sweeping changes in the way healthcare ads are handled in China.It was no small matter for Baidu, and by extension, it was no small matter for BIDU stock holders. Healthcare advertising up until that time accounted for roughly a fourth of the search engine's ad revenue. The number of advertisers Baidu served during the quarterfell 11% from a year-earlier, to only 524,000.Encouraging News for BaiduAnd yet, even beyond the impact of tighter regulations, there's something of a silver lining to this particular cloud.As it turns out, taking Qunar out of the picture, Baidu's revenue actually grew nearly 7%.Qunar was partially owned by Baidu, but last year essentiallyexchanged its stake in the online travel agent to a stake in rival OTACtrip.Com International Ltd (ADR)(NASDAQ:CTRP), putting Qunar in arguably better hands than it was in as part of the Baidu family. Although the echoes of that disruption are still ringing, Ctrip and Baidu have maintained an amicable relationship. Baidu CEO Robin Li hopes that hands-off partnership with partially owned Ctrip.com will serve as the model for deals in the future.It's also noteworthy that BIDU continued to cultivate a strong mobile presence, as China - just like the United States - is becoming a mostly mobile market.The evidence: The number of consumers that used Baidu's mobile search engine at least once per month grew 3% year-over-year, to 660 million. Mobile map usage was up 7% last quarter. Perhaps more telling than any other measure of progress on the mobile front, however, is the 99% increase in the number of consumers that have activated Baidu's digital wallet.Along these lines, some also suspect Li is looking to shed its stake in offline-to-offline outfitNuomi, which has proven to be an expensive headache.Looking Ahead for BIDU StockIn spite of the encouraging progress on the mobile front, Baidu conceded that new advertising rules would take a bigger toll in the quarter currently underway than they did in the prior quarter. The company anticipates Q4's revenue willroll in between $2.63 billion and $2.71 billion, down anywhere from 2% to nearly 5% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts were collectively expecting $2.89 billion worth of sales for the fourth quarter.3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Cisco Systems,     Inc. (CSCO), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation     (MSFT)That should be the worst of any headwind, however. Li explained:""We expect the most pronounced impact on our business in the fourth quarter followed by recovery early next year.""In the meantime, Baidu continues to cultivate its artificial intelligence project and self-driving cars. Those efforts aren't expected to add to the value of BIDU stock anytime soon, but they will eventually.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election?The 10 Best ETFs on the PlanetThe postBaidu Inc ADR (BIDU) Stock Has a Brighter Future Than You Thinkappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Better Buy: Cisco Systems Inc. or Oracle Corporation?;10/26/2016;"Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andOracle(NYSE: ORCL) are often considered dusty ""old tech"" stocks that   are owned for income instead of growth. But with the market   hovering near historic highs, both stocks might appeal to   investors looking for more conservative plays that can weather   the eventual downturn. But is one of these plays better than the   other? Let's compare these companies' core strengths and   weaknesses to decide.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Cisco's strengths and weaknessesLast year, nearly half of Cisco's revenue came from sales of   routers and switches . Both are slow-growth businesses -- router   sales fell 4% last year as switching sales stayed flat. Both   businesses face three major headwinds: sluggish enterprise   spending, competition from cheaper rivals likeHuawei, and the rise of cloud-based networking solutions reducing the   need for traditional routers and switches.To diversify away from those two businesses, Cisco has   aggressively expanded into higher-growth markets like   cybersecurity and service provider video. However, its   double-digit growth in those two markets isn't significantly   boosting its  overall revenue, which is expected to rise   just 1% this year. Earnings, boosted by buybacks, are expected to   rise 3%.Oracle's strengths and weaknessesOracle's core businesses of database and hardware are also   slow-growth ones. Both businesses face similar headwinds as Cisco   -- weak enterprise spending, macro headwinds, and a market shift   toward more scalable cloud-based services.In response, Oracle has been pivoting its aging businesses   toward cloud-as-a-service platforms. Last quarter, Oracle's   combined cloud and on-premise software revenues, which accounted   for  nearly 80% of its top line, rose 5% annually to $6.8   billion. Total cloud revenues, which include its SaaS (software   as a service), PaaS (platform as a service), and IaaS   (infrastructure as a service) platforms, rose 59% to $969   million. But like Cisco, that double-digit growth isn't   significantly boosting its total revenue or earnings, which are   respectively expected to climb about 1.5% and 1% this year.Which stock is fundamentally cheaper?Cisco currently trades at 14 times earnings, which is much   lower than the industry average of 25 for networking equipment   makers. Oracle has a P/E of 18, which is also a discount to the   average P/E of 54 for the application software industry. Both   stocks also trade at a discount to the S&P 500's current P/E   of 25.Looking ahead, analysts expect Cisco to grow its earnings by   9% annually over the next five years. That estimate gives it a   5-year PEG (price to earnings growth) ratio of 1.3. Oracle's   earnings are expected to rise about 8% per year during that same   period, giving it a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.9. Since a PEG ratio   under 1 is considered ""cheap,"" neither Cisco nor Oracle look   undervalued relative to their earnings growth potential -- but   Cisco looks cheaper.Dividends and buybacksCisco has hiked its dividend annually for five consecutive   years, while Oracle has done the same for four. However, Cisco's   forward yield of 3.5% is much higher than Oracle's 1.6% yield.   Over the past 12 months, Cisco spent 38% of its free cash flow in   dividends, while Oracle spent 20%. This indicates that Oracle has   more room to raise its dividend, yet it pays a lower yield than   Cisco.However, Oracle favors buybacks over dividends -- it spent 65%   of its FCF on buybacks over the past 12 months, while Cisco only   spent 22%. Cisco's more conservative use of its FCF on dividends   and buybacks gives it more cash to pursue big acquisitions. Both   companies are heavily focused on inorganic growth -- Cisco   acquired (or announced plans to acquire) 11 companies over    the past 12 months, while Oracle acquired nine smaller   players.The winner: CiscoCisco isn't an exciting stock, but its lower valuation, higher   dividend, and preference for using its FCF on dividends and   acquisitions instead of buybacks makes it a better long-term play   in my book. Oracle isn't a terrible investment, butplenty of other""mature tech"" companies have better upcoming catalysts and higher   dividends.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.APPLE INC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAPPLE INC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|APPLE INC QuoteOur TakeBetter-than-expected iPhone sales have definitely come as a respite. The company is also seeing strength in the number of switchers from Android and other operating systems to iOS.But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the high-growth regions for Apple. Competition is also mounting in most of the markets in which Apple operates.Nonetheless, Apple is optimistic about the long-term growth prospects in regions like China and India. The expected launch of newer devices in the current quarter will also open more avenues for the company's growth.Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices. Also, in the long run, Apple is expected to benefit from its robust cash position, strength in technology and the ecosystem that it has built, given its loyal customer base. Further, its enterprise collaborations with the likes of Deloitte, IBM Corp.IBM, CiscoCSCOand SAP SESAPare expected to be important long-term growth drivers.Currently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

7 Top Stocks to Buy for Months of Red-Hot Returns;10/25/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe last week of October is upon us. This is the homestretch, folks.Source:Shan Sheehan via Flickr (Modified)When it comes to finding the top stocks to buy, now is the time to hunt. Historically speaking, October is one of the most volatile months of the year … but it sets the stage for a strong rally into year's end.makeArticleAd();This year,the election, constant talk about interest rates and a semi-positive earnings season (so far) have allowed investors to seemingly emerge from the month with fewer scratches than normal. From our perspective, this is more likely to set the stage for a stronger rally in November and December as investors are starting to feel like they may miss out on the market's last push for 2016.What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election?With that as the backdrop, here are seven of the top stocks to buy that should outperform the rest of the market over the final two exciting months of the year:7 Top Stocks to Buy for Red-Hot Returns: Netflix (NFLX)Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX)knocked the cover off of the ballwith its earnings report a few weeks ago, giving shares of NFLX a 25% jump in value.But that shouldn't be all that we see from Netflix stock for the rest of the year.Content and delivery are king, which is why we're seeing so much M&A activity in the media sector of the market. Netflix is one of the originals in this area and has made it clear that it will invest big in this growing business. NFLX's second investment, into global expansion, is showing signs of growth, and no other company has the groundwork laid out like Netflix.NFLX's surge moves it from a perfect test of its 20-month moving average to almost hitting new all-time highs. The test of the long-term support will get the technicians back on board after Netflix spent much of 2016 worrying investors.As much as it seems wrong, sentiment is still pessimistic toward Netflix. Put simply, much of Wall Street has been on the wrong side of this stock, and now they're in for a long, painful game of catch-up. As of today, 51% of the analysts covering the stock have it ranked a buy - that's lower than theS&P 500average!Expect analysts to upgrade NFLX over the next few weeks when we see any dips in price.7 Top Stocks to Buy for Red-Hot Returns: Lockheed Martin (LMT)The market is ""buying the news"" afterLockheed Martin Corporation(NYSE:LMT) announced better-than-expected earnings results. From a fundamental perspective, this is one one of the strongest earnings reports in Lockheed Martin's last five years, fueling a significant move.The rally comes after LMT spent the past two weeks trading just below the key 200-day moving average. It was relatively clear that the market was ""selling the rumor"" ahead of the report (erroneously!), creating a post-earnings trading opportunity.Today's response to the positive report has resulted in a move back above the 200-day moving average and has brought the stock out of a technically oversold status, helping shares rally.More significant is the recent pullback to the 50-week moving average, the first since February of this year. This has been staunch support for the shares since the long-term bullish rally was put in place in 2013.The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy     NowThe positive earnings report along with the positive fundamental story ofeither presidential candidate being bullish for defense stocksmakes Lockheed Martin a clear bull play. Our year-end target for LMT is well above $260.7 Top Stocks to Buy for Red-Hot Returns: First Financial Bancorp (FFBC)Regional banks have been leading the market higher as the reality of higher interest rates is being factored into valuations. Per regional banks specifically, higher rates mean better balance sheet activity and stronger valuations because they get their operating revenue from traditional banking business.First Financial Bancorp(NASDAQ:FFBC) is a smaller regional in the southwest Ohio area. The bank has been making moves to expand and brand over the last two years, and that move has yielded results. The most recent quarter's earnings marked a second consecutive besting of analyst expectations after a year of disappointing or in-line results.Technically speaking, FFBC is a leader in its sector and against the market, returning 23% year-to-date and maintaining strong technical trends. Sentiment toward this market leader is negative, indicating that the ""wall of worry"" is in place for shares to climb higher.Of the nine analysts tracking the stock, zero have it ranked a buy. In other words, we are likely to see upgraders as the fundamental story gets even better.Look for First Financial Bancorp to continue climbing the wall toward a price target of $24.7 Top Stocks to Buy for Red-Hot Returns: Cisco Systems (CSCO)The ""old school"" technology stocks continue to lead things higher as companies likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) are setting the pace for the new round of technology infrastructure. Networking giant Cisco has shed some of the fat from years ago and is emerging as a major contributor to the ""internet of things.""Cisco shares are up more than 15% for the year, double that of their Nasdaq-100 brethren, putting them in the relative-strength position that most investors should be looking for. CSCO is trading above key technical and trendline support as they head into the end of the year, which will bolster their performance.Seasonality is strong for the Nasdaq-100, as it outpaces the broader S&P 500 index through the months of November and December. Cisco only accounts for 3% of the weight of the index -Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is about 14% on its own - but remains in the top 10 components. Sentiment toward Cisco is more positive than many of the stocks on our bullish list, but not overdone to the point where the stock is considered ""crowded.""7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to     RichesFor now, the trends and positive seasonality should continue to move Cisco in the right direction toward our target of $34.7 Top Stocks to Buy for Red-Hot Returns: Nordstrom (JWN)'Tis the season, right? Eh, more like ""maybe.""The holiday season this year is going to come down to execution, andNordstrom, Inc.(NYSE:JWN) has been setting the stage for some success. The trends we've seen in the retail sector have displayed a splintering of the sector into ""haves"" and ""have nots.""Nordstrom is a ""have.""JWN has been a relative-strength leader in a turnaround move that started earlier in the year with management changes. Now, the stock is trying to break above March highs and regain the $55 level.The last earnings report gave investors some hope, but there's a considerable level of pessimism toward Nordstrom stock, so it's easy for the retailer to impress, leading to higher stock prices. Short interest on JWN is a whopping 12 times the average daily volume, signaling the potential for a short covering squeeze to drive prices higher.Similarly, the analyst recommendations on Nordstrom are low, with nine of 29 analysts covering the stock ranking it a buy.Nordstrom stock typically has a seasonal tailwind, and this year looks no different as the higher-end retailers are likely to attract more buyers than the lower tier. Our models target a price for JWN above the $62 level before year-end.7 Top Stocks to Buy for Red-Hot Returns: Nvidia (NVDA)Every time we look,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is hitting another short-term high and still remains on our model's bull list. The semiconductor sector is booming, despite flat PC business, because we're putting all of those chips in devices in our hands and cars, and TVs, and video games. This is the market that Nvidia serves, which is why it continues to push higher.Earnings on the chip manufacturer are coming up on Nov. 10, but the last few days have looked like earnings bolstered the shares asTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andRambus Inc.(NASDAQ:RMBS) announced deals with the company. Shares continue to trade higher as we see the bearish investors that have been betting against the stock build the wall of worry.Short sellers are against the stock by 6.6 times the average daily volume of Nvidia shares, and only 51% of the analyst community rates the stock a buy. Keep in mind that NVDA stock is trading higher by 115% year-to-date (that's not a typo).7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double     DigitsLook for earnings in early November to produce another short squeeze and upgrades that will push Nvidia Corporation toward a target of $78 or higher.7 Top Stocks to Buy for Red-Hot Returns: Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)Finally, we look at another regional bank that appears ready to roll higher as the fundamental and technical picture improve.Fifth Third Bancorp(NASDAQ:FITB), another southwest Ohio regional bank (though larger than First Financial), should also benefit from the interest-rate environment. FITB already has been operating with improving margins as it adopts newer technology. Now, the balance sheet effect of higher rates should improve the bank's fundamental outlook.Fifth Third shares are trading above their 50-day trendline, which is also trending higher. This bullish technical indicator provides a bullish forecast for the bank's shares over the next three to six months. Like Nvidia, FITB shares have been ignored by the analyst community despite the positive operating environment of even a single rate hike. Currently, a mere eight of the 31 analysts covering the stock have it ranked a buy.Fifth Third spent the past week rallying as its earnings report came out in line with analyst expectations. Those earnings garnered one price-target increase, but it's still early in the season.Shares recently bounced off of long-term support from their 20-month moving average, which is also the line of demarcation between a bull and bear market trend for a stock. Long-term trends and a positive fundamental environment has us targeting $24.50 on FITB shares.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a   position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post7 Top Stocks to Buy for Months of Red-Hot Returnsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Will Nokia Corporation's (NOK) Q3 Earnings Disappoint?;10/25/2016;"Networking giant,Nokia CorporationNOKis scheduled to report third-quarter 2016 results on Oct 27, before the market opens.Last quarter, Nokia's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company surpassed estimates in two of the last four quarters with the average earnings beat of 13.54%.Factors at PlayNokia has been investing heavily in new technologies and products. We expect these initiatives to have an adverse impact on the company's bottom line due to increased costs. We are also concerned about the underperformance of the Networks unit. Moreover, the company is stiff competition from peers like Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOand Motorola Solutions Inc.MSI. The company's globally diversified operations also expose it to adverse foreign exchange movements.However, we expect Nokia to gain from synergies created through its acquisition of Withings S.A. and Alcatel-Lucent. We are also impressed with the company's new range of products in the wireless segment and collaboration with China Telecom for the enhancement of 4G coverage in China.Earnings WhispersmakeArticleAd();Our proven model does not conclusively show that Nokia is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Better Buy: Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. vs. Cisco Systems Inc.;10/25/2016;"Though both stocks are up year to date,HP Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) andCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) shareholders have had a bumpy ride in the last   month or so, with shares declining 6% and 4%, respectively. Rumor   has it that HP Enterprise will announce additional job cuts,   though a spokesperson said its simply following through with its   existing restructuring plan.Cisco is also going through a transformation, which explains   its own round of layoffs that began this quarter. As many as   5,500 employees, equal to 7% of Cisco's global workforce, will be   let go. Neither Cisco's nor HP Enterprise's realignments are   surprising given their push to expand in the cloud and Internet   of Things (IoT) markets, but that hasn't prevented investors from   getting antsy.The upside is the recent share-price declines have made both   HP Enterprise and Cisco even better investment opportunities,   making the question of which is the better buy almost a   toss-up.makeArticleAd();Image source: Cisco.Why Cisco is a good buyDespite perceptions to the contrary, Cisco's decision to pare   its workforce isn't purely about cutting overhead. The objective   is to shift resources away from what Cisco refers to as ""lower   growth areas"" so it can ""further invest in key priority areas   such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center   and cloud.""Impressively, even in the midst of Cisco's business   transition, it's still performing admirably, particularly in the   key areas that will drive future growth. Excluding Cisco's   ""other"" unit and its now-divested SP video business, last fiscal   year's best-performing divisions are a snapshot of CEO Chuck   Robbins' strategic plan.Security revenue climbed 13% in fiscal 2016 compared to a   year-ago to $1.97 billion, and its collaboration unit -- its   third-largest revenue source behind only legacy routers and   switches -- increased 9% to $4.45 billion. Toss in the $3.7   billion in data center sales, much of which is cloud-related, and   Cisco is already delivering where it counts. And Cisco's 3.5%   dividend yield doesn't hurt either.Image source: HP   Enterprise.Why HP Enterprise is a good buyChange isn't always viewed favorably by investors, but the   significant restructuring of HP Enterprise should prove to be a   win-win before long. CEO Meg Whitman got the ball rolling earlier   this year when she announced the tax-free spinoff and merger of   HP Enterprise's second-largest unit -- enterprise services --   withComputer Sciences Corp.The $8.5 billion deal with CSC includes a 50% stake in the new   ""pure-play"" powerhouse, a $1.5 billion cash dividend, and HP   Enterprise will rid itself of $2.5 billion in debt. For an   encore, HP Enterprise also announced a similar deal for its   ""non-core software assets"" with U.K.-basedMicro Focus. The $8.8 billion merger with Micro Focus also includes an   ownership stake of 50.1% for HP Enterprise shareholders, along   with a $2.5 billion one-time payment for Whitman and team.By the end of March 2017 -- the expected closing dates of the   mergers -- HP Enterprise shareholders will own shares of three   separate entities, pocket a nice dividend, and Whitman will be   closer to her strategy of ""creating a faster-growing,   higher-margin, stronger cash flow company."" Enterprise services   did generate $4.7 billion in revenue last quarter, but it was   also HP Enterprise's lowest margin unit by a wide margin, and   software was its worst-performing division.Shedding businesses not related to HP Enterprise's core   competencies will help it focus on what it does best: delivering   Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) in the cloud. This year, IaaS   is expected to become a $294 billion market, easily making it the   cloud's largest segment, and HP Enterprise is poised to garner   its share.HP Enterprise and Cisco both offer tremendous upside in   fast-growing markets, but the latter's stellar 3.5% dividend   yield makes it the better buy for growth and income investors.   But when it comes strictly to appreciation potential, a leaner   more focused HP Enterprise gets the nod.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Microsoft, Ciena, Barracuda Networks, Cisco Systems and Advanced Micro Devices;10/25/2016;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - October 25, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Ciena Corporation(NYSE:CIEN-Free Report),Barracuda Networks, Inc.(NYSE:CUDA-Free Report),Cisco Systems(NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Cloud Stocks to Buy as Microsoft SoarsOn Friday, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) bettered its last record close achieved in Dec 1999, back during the dot-com era. Encouraging first quarter earnings results lifted the software major's shares higher. Rising demand for cloud software and services were the primary reason for this spectacular performance.These results once again underline the growing importance of the cloud. Stocks gaining from the cloud computing phenomena make for attractive options at this point. Adding them to your portfolios would make for a prudent choice.Azure Boosts Microsoft's ResultsMicrosoft's first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 76 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. Revenues of $22.33 billion increased 3.1% from the year-ago quarter and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.54 billion.The high point of these results was revenue from Azure, which soared 121% year over year, with Azure compute usage doubling. Microsoft is benefitting from its hybrid and hyperscale cloud, which spans multiple jurisdictions. This makes it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations all over the world and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate.This is the reason Microsoft cites which has drawn 80% of the world's largest banks to Azure. Moreover, the company's expanding cloud services have also helped it to capture big customers.Cloud's Prospects Remain StrongAccording to a study by non-profit association CompTIA released last month, most companies are continuing to make major investments related to the cloud. More than 90% of the companies surveyed utilized some form of cloud computing. However, businesses are also becoming more selective in the kind of cloud technology which are they choosing adopt.Meanwhile, the primary motivation behind adopting cloud computing technology is the associated cost reduction. The survey revealed that 44% of medium businesses, 47% of larger companies and 41% of the small businesses which were part of the survey believed that cost reduction was a more important reason for implementing cloud technologies compared with others, such as increased speed, lesser complexity and modernization.The most encouraging finding of the survey was that most of these companies were utilizing cloud solutions for a period of one to five years. Of these, only 6% were using such solutions for five years. In contrast, 23% of the companies were using such solutions for a period lesser than a year. This indicates that despite signs that the cloud market may be maturing; the sector's growth potential remains intact.Our ChoicesThe fact that Azure's performance is a major reason for Microsoft's encouraging results serves to underscore the growing importance of the cloud computing market. A recently released survey indicates that the prospects for this sector still remain bright.This is why it may be a prudent option to pick stocks which can gain from this phenomenon. However, picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult.This is where ourVGM scorecomes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 88.89%. However, we note that Gigamon has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 52.78% over the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayFor third-quarter 2016, revenues are anticipated in the range of $78 million to $80 million, up 39% year over year at the midpoint.

3 Things to Look For When Barrick Gold Reports Q3 Earnings;10/24/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Barrick Gold(NYSE: ABX)  is set to release its third-quarter earnings on   Oct. 26. With earnings season upon us, are you finding yourself   interested but equally worried about drowning in a flood of facts   and figures? It's not uncommon during this time of year. Let's   prepare by keying in on three things we can expect management to   address in its report.Rumor has itUndoubtedly, management will pay considerable attention to one   of the company's priorities for 2016: improving its balance   sheet. Through the first half of 2016, Barrick has paid down $968   million of its debt -- nearly half of its fiscal 2016 debt   reduction goal of $2 billion. So keep an eye on further progress   made in the recent quarter toward achieving that target. But theamountof debt may not be the only point of interest.makeArticleAd();Also look for management to address the mining industry's   speculation that Barrick is seeking to sell its 64% equity stake   in Acacia -- valued at approximately $1.9 billion -- to help   finance its debt reduction strategy. Management has made it clear   that it's willing to sell its non-core assets to help pay down   its debt, but it hasn't revealed any specific deals.Forecasting improved performance in 2016, management expects   to profit from Acacia even if it remains in the company's   portfolio. In Barrick's 40-F from 2015, management forecast 2016   gold production to fall between 480,000 ounces and 500,000 ounces   -- a year-over-year improvement from the 468,000 ounces of   production in 2015. In addition, the company expects to further   benefit from a reduction in costs. Whereas all-in sustaining   costs totaled $1,112 per gold ounce in 2015 at the Acacia mine,   management expects this figure to fall between $950 and $980 per   gold ounce in 2016.Lucky number sixBesides reducing its debt, one of Barrick's priorities for   2016 is to improve its free cash flow. In fact, it has set the   ambitious target of generating free cash flow per share even if   theprice of   goldwere to fall to $1,000 per ounce.Through the first half of the year -- during which the average   spot price of gold was $1,221 per ounce -- the company has   performed well, reporting $455 million in free cash flow.Image source: Getty Images.In fact, the second quarter of 2016 marked the fifth   consecutive quarter in which Barrick has reported free cash flow.   And with the price of gold hovering around $1,300 per ounce in   the third quarter, expect Barrick to improve its streak to six   consecutive quarters.Management attributes its free cash flow growth, in large   part, to its ability to consistently lower capital expenditures;   however, on the Q2 conference call, it indicated that capex   spending will rise in the second half of the year. And this won't   be the only factor compromising free cash flow growth. Barrick's   CFO, Catherine Raw, stated on the call that the third quarter is   expected to be the highest in terms of all-in sustaining costs   for the year.Elaboration on digitizationLastly, investors should expect management to address   Barrick's recent partnership withCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) to -- as stated in the press release -- ""drive   Barrick's digital reinvention."" Working together at the Cortez   mine in Nevada, the two companies will deploy sensing technology   throughout the mine to produce real-time operational data.The digitization of the Cortez mine is expected to improve not   only environmental and safety performance but also   the management of energy, water, and emissions. Consistent   with management's long-term vision for the company, the digital   reinvention of Barrick is meant ""to help Barrick deliver on its   vision of growing free cash flow per share over the long   term.""During the Q2 earnings presentation, management provided   improved full-year guidance for Cortez, estimating the mine's   AISC to fall between $520 and $550 per ounce. It will be   interesting to see if management further improves upon the   guidance in light of the partnership with Cisco and when it   expects to deploy this technology at any of its other mines.The takeawayWith its eyes on reducing debt and growing free cash flow,   Barrick's management is clearly working to secure the company's   long-term success, and I'd be surprised if the company's   third-quarter earnings don't reflect the fruits of this labor.   Though there may be a slowdown in the rate at which the company   is growing free cash flow, I expect the company to remain on   track to achieve its goal of reducing debt by $2 billion for   2016.One additional thing I'll be looking for is an update on the   temporary closure of the company's Veladero mine. Though it had   initially suggested that the closure wouldn't have a material   impact on the company's earnings, management has not recently   reaffirmed this position, so it'll be interesting to see if   management provides further commentary.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Juniper Earnings Preview: Services To Drive Revenue Growth, Improve Profitability;10/24/2016;"Juniper Networks(JNPR) is scheduled to announce its Q3 results after market close on October 25th. The company expects roughly flat revenues over the year-ago period at $1.25 billion with the gross margin compressing by around a percentage point to 63%, as shown in the table below. Margins are expected to be slightly lower than 2015 levels, primarily due to pricing pressure for product sales leading to lower gross margins for the products division.In the first half of the year, Juniper experienced a 3% annual decline in product sales to $1.62 billion. Moreover, the gross margin of the product division compressed by 140 basis points over the comparable prior-year period, mainly due to elevated pricing pressure on products, especially in the EMEA region. Within the product division, Juniper witnessed strength in the Switching business, with revenues growing by double digits in Q2 both year over year and sequentially. Strong demand for Switching products was driven by telecom customers and the government sector. Moreover, the newly introduced QFX 10K platforms are expected to drive revenue growth in the latter half of the year.makeArticleAd();On the other hand, Services revenues were up 13% year over year in the same period. Growth was driven by the company's cloud-enabled brand solution that allows enterprise customers and managed service providers to provide on-demand cloud services. Additionally, the improvement in Services gross margin was impacted by timing of spare parts purchases in previous quarters.As a result, Juniper management has taken measures to restrict growth in its operating expenses over the last two quarters. The company aims to improve its cost structure such that its operating expenses for the third quarter fall by 7% y-o-y to around $500 million. This is likely to further improve operating profit for the company.Have more questions about Juniper?

5 Cloud Stocks to Buy as Microsoft Soars;10/24/2016;"On Friday, Microsoft CorporationMSFTbettered its last record close achieved in Dec 1999, back during the dot-com era. Encouraging first quarter earnings results lifted the software major's shares higher. Rising demand for cloud software and services were the primary reason for this spectacular performance.These results once again underline the growing importance of the cloud. Stocks gaining from the cloud computing phenomena make for attractive options at this point. Adding them to your portfolios would make for a prudent choice.Azure Boosts Microsoft's ResultsMicrosoft's first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 76 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. Revenues of $22.33 billion increased 3.1% from the year-ago quarter and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.54 billion.The high point of these results was revenue from Azure, which soared 121% year over year, with Azure compute usage doubling. Microsoft is benefitting from its hybrid and hyperscale cloud, which spans multiple jurisdictions. This makes it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations all over the world and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate.This is the reason Microsoft cites which has drawn 80% of the world's largest banks to Azure. Moreover, the company's expanding cloud services have also helped it to capture big customers like BoeingBA, Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric and FacebookFB. (Read:Microsoft (MSFT) Beats Q1 Earnings on Strong Cloud Growth)Cloud's Prospects Remain StrongAccording to a study by non-profit association CompTIA released last month, most companies are continuing to make major investments related to the cloud. More than 90% of the companies surveyed utilized some form of cloud computing. However, businesses are also becoming more selective in the kind of cloud technology which are they choosing adopt.Meanwhile, the primary motivation behind adopting cloud computing technology is the associated cost reduction. The survey revealed that 44% of medium businesses, 47% of larger companies and 41% of the small businesses which were part of the survey believed that cost reduction was a more important reason for implementing cloud technologies compared with others, such as increased speed, lesser complexity and modernization.The most encouraging finding of the survey was that most of these companies were utilizing cloud solutions for a period of one to five years. Of these, only 6% were using such solutions for five years. In contrast, 23% of the companies were using such solutions for a period lesser than a year. This indicates that despite signs that the cloud market may be maturing; the sector's growth potential remains intact.Our ChoicesThe fact that Azure's performance is a major reason for Microsoft's encouraging results serves to underscore the growing importance of the cloud computing market.

VR & AR World And Broadband World Forum Highlights;10/24/2016;"ByEdward Schneider, CFA:I attended the inauguralVR & AR Worldconference as well as the 16th annualBroadband World Forum(BBWF) at the ExCel Centre in London from October 18th to October 20th. VR (virtual reality) & AR (augmented reality) World was ""virtually"" thriving with excitement and potential, but was a bit short on current economic reality. In contrast, BBWF was a more mundane event, but with established carrier budgets in the billions of dollars behind the scenes making bets in areas likeG.fast.G.fast is a digital subscriber line [DSL] protocol for high-speed broadband transmission of around 300MB/second over copper lines. G.fast speed advantage runs out of steam beyond one kilometer. The cost is quite high, however, to rip out copper lines at the last kilometer of a network and replace it with super-fast optical fiber lines. British Telecom (BT) estimates it would cost about £29B ($35B) to replace its copper lines with fiber. BT plans to limit these optical fiber replacement costs, by spending only £6B ($7B) through 2020, retrofitting the last kilometer with G.fast processors and equipment. Beneficiaries of G.fast include companies like Broadcom, now part of Avago (AVGO), as well as ADTRAN (ADTN). While G.fast is slower than optical fiber, it is much faster than the 30MB-50MB/second speeds that most DSL consumers have today. G.fast, in fact, can be a conduit for millions of consumers to enjoy the new world of VR & AR.BBWF represents a more mature carrier and network infrastructure industry, where carrier network spending is projected to decrease 3% in 2016. This carrier spending slowdown in part reflects the beginning of a shift to software defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), and away from traditional routing equipment from vendors such as Cisco (CSCO). Beneficiaries of this long-tailed transition to SDN and NFV include Red Hat (RHT) which provides open-source Linux integration for cloud infrastructure, spanning OpenStack and software-defined networking. For more color on SDN and NFV, please refer to mylatest articleon this subject.makeArticleAd();In contrast, VR & AR is just at the beginning of a long journey, in a market that is expected to grow from a small base today to several billion dollars by 2020. FutureSource projected VR content alone to reach $6B by 2020. Ovum forecasts the total VR market to reach $285B by 2020. In my opinion, 2020 VR & AR revenues will be a fraction Ovum's estimate. Nonetheless, the dynamic growth potential of the VR & AR markets is evident.Today, consumers are just becoming aware of virtual and augmented reality, mainly through games. This summer's Pokemon craze put AR on the map, albeit in a dumbed-down version. To increase awareness and make VR & AR more widespread, a few things need to happen.First, the price-points need to come down to mass-market levels. Valve/HTC (2498.TW) VR headsetVive($800 ASP) and the soon-to-be-releasedMeta 2($949 ASP) AR headset are moving closer to critical-mass price points. Microsoft (MSFT)Hololens($3000 ASP) had some impressive features such as moving and changing virtual objects with your hands, but is still priced too high for most consumers. First-mover Facebook (FB)Oculus Rift($800 ASP including Oculus Touch) is also helping to create a viable VR market. But $800 headsets are still out of reach for many consumers.To be fair, there are some lower-priced, generally less-advanced headsets including Sony (SNE)PlayStation VR($400 ASP plus PlayStation console), Samsung (SSNLF)Gear VR($200 ASP including controller plus smartphone, co-designed with Oculus), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL)Daydream($100 ASP plus smartphone), LG (LGEAF)360 VR($250 ASP plus smartphone), and ZeissVR One($150 ASP plus smartphone). I was impressed with HumanEyes Technologies' Vuze 360 degree immersive audio/video camera and advanced video-editing stitching technology. I would categorize these technologies as quasi-VR, although they have the most near-term potential. According to Digitimes, shipments of VR-enabled smartphones are expected to soar to 70 million units in 2016, accounting for 5% of global smartphone shipments.Second, content needs to improve for wider-scale monetization. Vive has been on the market for six months. During that time, Vive partnered with various game companies, two of which have already achieved revenues in excess of $1M. As the breadth and quality of the games improve, the market will grow. Today, the VR & AR markets are still missing the killer app or game beyond Pokemon that will really spike the growth curve. Epic Games/Tencent Holdings' (TCEHY)Robo Recallto be launched in Q1 2017 potentially could be a killer game.Third, the hardware needs to step up. The latency has to come down to the milliseconds, the power consumption needs to decline dramatically, field of vision needs to expand to closer to 180 degrees, head-set weight and size need to shrink, augmented display technology needs to improve, and telecom networks need to be able to transmit these VR & AR features to consumers. Encouragingly, progress on these fronts was demonstrated at the trade show. TheLighthouse laser trackingfor virtual navigation inside Vive is especially impressive.I chaired an Innovation Panel at VR & AR World, with Christian Brändli ofInsightness, Vitaly Ponomarev ofWayRayand Dominic Eskofier ofNvidia(NVDA). Insightness makes event-based visual positioning modules that process pixels like the human brain. The company's Silicon Eye vision sensors and proprietary processing algorithms lead to exponentially faster image processing/lower power consumption, while providing 3D spatial awareness of where you are. Insightness can enable next-generation AR and VR hardware to meet the low power consumption, fast millisecond response times, and focal positioning to create a better end-user experience. WayRay builds AR car windshield navigation systems. The company's unique holographic and inertial sensor technology, enable longer and wider fields of view than exist today. WayRay should be a boon to the budding driverless car market.Nvidia GeForce, Quadro and Tegra graphic processor units (GPUs) are the engines for high-end gaming, including VR & AR. Nvidia, via its Tesla and GRID chips, also has a fast-growing artificial intelligence [AI] business. Nvidia faces competition from a number of GPU competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in gaming. For AI markets like data centers, high-performance computing and driverless cars, Nvidia faces competition from GPU-based Nirvana/Intel (INTC), Intel from the computer processing field, CEVA (CEVA) from the digital signal processor angle, ARM/SoftBank (SFTBF) and ThinCI. While Nvidia chips' parallel processing capabilities are impressive, Nvidia's key competitive advantage may be providing software engineers well-documented platforms for building applications on top of its core processors, such as CUDA for parallel programming and G-Sync for displays.Advances in processors and platforms (Nvidia), displays (WayRay) and image sensors (Insightness) can help VR & AR hardware reach its potential. Nvidia would be the publicly-quoted way to broadly access the future growth of VR, AR and AI, although the stock is not cheap.Visionaries espoused the potential of VR & AR in the coming decade. Huawei's Richard Li saw three main VR & AR markets - video, gaming and online shopping. Video and gaming have the largest potential according to Mr. Li. For VR gaming, Mr. Li estimated 216M gamers generating $11.5B in revenues by 2025. Shopping has potential, but will require high-bandwidth real-time interaction with objects.Meta's Ryan Pamplin provided a vivid view of an augmented and virtual reality future. He pictured hardware devices to be 3D (not flat), wide viewing, have interactive sculpting of virtual objects, with the ability to turn on and off application layers that are contextually relevant to the user. By 2020, the form factor will be small enough to put on glasses or lenses, and AR and VR will become more main-stream from on-line shopping and fashion designers to mobile phones. By 2030, Mr. Pamplin said that we will go beyond glasses to human brain-derived images, millisecond latency, multi-gigabit throughput, photo-realistic optics, all processed in the cloud.See alsoDepomed: A Gift From The Indexerson seekingalpha.com"

Should You Buy Fortinet Inc. On Its Double-Digit Drop?;10/23/2016;"Cybersecurity firmFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) has fallen 13% over the past month, with most of   the decline occurring after it pre-announced its  third   quarter earnings on Oct. 11. The numbers initially looked decent   -- the company expects revenue to rise 20% to 22% annually, while   billings should improve 14% to 16%.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();However, both estimates were reduced from higher guidance, and   represent a significant slowdown from its 30% revenue growth and   26% billings growth in the previous quarter. It would also   represent Fortinet's slowest year-over-year sales growth since   the fourth quarter of 2013. CEO Ken Xie attributed that slowdown   to longer deal cycles, sluggish enterprise spending, sales   execution challenges in North America, and macro challenges in   Latin America and the U.K.However, Xie declared that the company remained ""confident in   the underlying strength of our business and long-term growth   opportunity, and committed to delivering returns to our   shareholders."" The company also boosted its share buyback plan by   $100 million to $300 million. Should investors take advantage of   Fortinet's recent swoon to start a position? Let's take a closer   look at Fortinet's business to find out.What does Fortinet do?Fortinet is the  fourth largest network security   appliance vendor in the world afterCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) ,Check Point(NASDAQ: CHKP) , andPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) , in that order. Fortinet serves over 280,000   customers worldwide, including the ""majority"" of the    Fortune 500.Fortinet's core product is a next-gen firewall called   Fortigate, which includes network security appliances connected   to its Fortinet Security Fabric. That ""fabric"" offers end-to-end   protection across on-premise, cloud-based, and Internet of Things   (IoT) devices. Fortinet also recently acquired security firm    AccelOps to strengthen its position in cloud and IoT   analytics.The bear case against FortinetFortinet's third quarter slowdown suggests that it is   gradually falling behind its closest rival, Palo Alto Networks.   Fortinet's revenue rose 31% in 2015, but  analysts expect   that growth to slow to 25% this year and 18% next year. Palo   Alto's revenue rose 49% last year, and is expected to grow 33%   this year and 30% next year.Palo Alto is also growing its market share at a faster rate   than Fortinet. IDC reports that between the second quarters of   2015 and  2016, Palo Alto's share of the network security   appliance market rose from 9.3% to 12.1%. During that period,   Fortinet's share grew from 8.2% to 9.8%.But even Palo Alto hasn't been growingfast enoughto satisfy investors -- that's why the stock has declined 16%   this year. If Palo Alto's growth rates are considered mediocre,   it's doubtful that investors will embrace Fortinet's slower   growth and smaller market share.Fortinet also isn't consistently profitable on a GAAP basis.   It reported a GAAP net loss of $1.4 million last quarter,   compared to a profit of $0.8 million in the prior year quarter.   Like Palo Alto, stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses are a   major weight on Fortinet's bottom line, gobbling up  22% of   its revenue last quarter.The bull case for FortinetHowever, Fortinet trades at just 4.7 times sales, compared to   Palo Alto's P/S ratio of 9.4. Fortinet's P/S ratio also hovers   near multi-year lows, so itmightrepresent a good long-term buying opportunity if cybersecurity   stocks rebound on stronger enterprise spending.Source:YChartsFortinet is also selling more subscription bundles with its   hardware to boost its gross margins. That effort has clearly paid   off over the past two years.Source:YChartsMeanwhile, Research and Markets estimates that the global   market of security appliances will  grow at a compound   annual growth rate of 11.4% between 2016 and 2020, fueled by an   increase in data breaches.While Fortinet's annual sales growth is slowing down, it's   unlikely to drop to the single digits for the foreseeable future.   With an enterprise value of $4.4 billion and a clean balance   sheet, Fortinet could also be a lucrative takeover target for   larger players like Cisco.Is it time to buy Fortinet?I believe that Fortinet's lower valuation and consistent   margin expansion make it a more compelling buy than Palo Alto.   But I also believe that the market for firewalls and threat   prevention solutions is a crowded one, and that Fortinet may   struggle to keep pace with its larger rivals over the long   term.Therefore, I would avoid Fortinet unless its sales growth   accelerates again. Until that happens, Fortinet will likely   remain under pressure as investors focus on higher-growth plays   in the cybersecurity sector.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Ericsson's (ERIC) Q3 Earnings in the Red, Shares Tumble;10/21/2016;"Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ)ERICmore than delivered on its profit warning last week for its third-quarter 2016 results, as it reported its first loss in nearly four years. Its diluted loss came in at SEK 7 (1 penny) in the quarter, compared with earnings of SEK 94 in the prior-year period.The Swedish wireless equipment maker had released ominous preliminary results last week, indicating a huge decline in top line, citing a steadily weakening mobile broadband business and overall adverse industry trends. The news shocked investors and sent the stock plummeting 20%.Ericsson reported non-IFRS earnings per share (excluding amortizations, write-downs of acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges) of SEK 34 (4 cents) for the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents by a whopping 55.6%. The bottom line fared even worse in year-over-year comparison, having fallen a colossal 75% from the prior-year tally of SEK 1.34.Investors were terribly disappointed with the top- and bottom-line miss. Ericsson's shares were trending down significantly inpre-market trading, falling 4.3% at one point.This is the third consecutive earnings miss for the Swedish giant. Ericsson missed earnings by nearly 29% in second-quarter 2016.The decline in bottom line can be attributed to the consistent weak product demand, which gave rise to weakness across the company's segments. Also, negative revaluation effects of currency hedge contracts and restructuring charges put further pressure on earnings.Inside the HeadlinesRevenues continued their downward spiral and fell 14% year over year to SEK 51.1 billion ($6 billion) for the quarter, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.5 billion.Sluggish growth in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East, completion of major projects in European markets and adverse currency translation hampered revenues. Other broader negative trends from the first half of the year accelerated as well, particularly impacting Networks segment.The decline in sales was all-pervasive, with all three operating segments of the company charting negative revenue growth.Segmental PerformanceOn a segmental basis, Networks revenues were down 19% year over year to SEK 23.3 billion ($2.7 billion). Markets with a weak macro environment recorded softness in both mobile broadband coverage and capacity sales. Delayed spectrum auction in India and lower 3G sales in China proved to be drag on sales in this segment.Also, lack of revenues on account of completion of major European mobile broadband projects in 2015 compounded the segment's problems. However, rapid 4G deployment in China, along with strong core networks sales compensated the decline to some extent.Global Services revenues fell 8% year over year to SEK 24.8 billion ($2.9 billion). Continued decline in Network Rollout sales and tepid professional services performance led to the unimpressive sales.Support Solutions revenues also went down 11% year over year to SEK 2.9 billion ($340 million), dragged primarily by lower software licensing sales in transformation projects.Ericsson's gross margin (excluding restructuring charges) in the quarter contracted 560 basis points year over year to 28.3%.The company's efforts to curb costs failed to offset the diminishing sales and thus, the company's margins contracted sharply. A bigger share of lower margin business like services business, along with lower sales in Networks and mobile broadband businesses, contributed to the compressed margins.The decline in Ericsson's operating margin (excluding restructuring charges) was even more pronounced, plummeting 790 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 0.7%. The effect of lower gross margin trickled down to operating margins, with higher R&D expenses further contracting it.Three-Pronged Growth PlanEricsson is presently following a three-pronged strategy to drive growth. The first strategic area is ""core business growth,"" in which the company is focusing on deployment of 4G and promotion of 5G. The company constantly seeks to seize business opportunities as operators shift toward 4G deployment and prepare grounds for the forthcoming 5G revolution.The second area of focus, which is to improve profitability in the targeted growth areas, is witnessing the company concentrate on ""software sales"" and ""recurring businesses"" to drive growth in its thriving Professional Services.The final growth area is ""cost and efficiency program"" that has been devised to generate higher cost savings. In fact, to adapt to and counteract the lower demand for mobile broadband investments, Ericsson has mapped a set of significant actions to boost efficiency and cut costs further.The formerly announced cost and efficiency program, through which Ericsson intends to unlock savings of SEK 9 billion in 2017, is moving ahead per the plan. Ericsson further revealed plans to reduce cost of sales, in order to adapt operations to weaker mobile broadband demand. The company plans to reduce the annual run rate of operating expenses (excluding restructuring charges) to SEK 53 billion in the second half of 2017, through these initiatives. This is comparable to SEK 63 billion in 2014, and equates to double the amount of savings in operating expenses that was previously targeted.LiquidityDuring the quarter, cash utilized in operating activities came to SEK 2.3 billion ($270 million), compared with cash generated from operating activities of SEK 1.6 billion at the end of third-quarter 2015.Ericsson's cash and cash equivalents as on Sep 30, 2016 totaled SEK 24.4 billion ($2.9 billion), compared with SEK 34 billion a year back.Changes in Company StructureIn first-quarter 2016, Ericsson announced a set of structural changes to improve strategy execution and drive efficiency. The company plans to design five business units and one dedicated customer group for Industry & Society, in line with its three-pronged growth strategy. With these changes, Ericsson believes that it will be better equipped to cater to the needs of multiple customer segments and leverage on market opportunities to drive faster growth.To ConcludeEricsson has been grappling with an industry wide slump in demand and fierce competition from China has further exacerbated this cyclical downturn. Investors have steadily lost faith in this company, which has tanked 49% over the past year.ERICSSON LM ADR Price and EPS SurpriseERICSSON LM ADR Price and EPS Surprise|ERICSSON LM ADR QuoteEricsson is contending with stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co. and Nokia Corp.NOK. Slumping demand in Russia and Brazil, and accelerating negative industry trends have further compounded its problems. Slowing pace of telecom industry, upgrades to 4G standards, and consequent lower spending from clients like Vodafone and Verizon have battered Ericsson's prospects.To combat such critical industry concerns, Ericsson recently struck a partnership with Cisco Systems Inc.CSCO, to boost its product lineup and sell more complete networks. The company expects that the deal would generate $1 billion or more in annual sales for each company by 2018.The company is also taking internal steps to stabilize its operations somewhat. It has plans to reduce its operating expenses by 10 billion kronor by 2017 compared with 2014. However, the company has acknowledged that its savings plans and job reductions do not seem enough to weather the swiftly declining demand.Whether the growth and cost-streamlining efforts of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company will help it beat industry-wide demand blues, remains to be seen.InterDigital, Inc.IDCCdevelops and markets advanced digital wireless telecommunications systems, using proprietary technologies for voice and data communications.

What's in Store for Juniper (JNPR) this Earnings Season?;10/21/2016;"Juniper Networks, Inc.JNPRis set to report third-quarter 2016 results on Oct 25,after the market closes. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.41%. Over the past four quarters, the company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 2.34%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayJuniper delivered decent second-quarter results. Though it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts, the metrics declined on a year-over-year basis.Ahead of its third quarter results, we are optimistic about the company's product launches, its cost reduction initiatives and improving execution. Also, the company's expansion into the software defined network segment should strengthen its position in the networking space.However, an uncertain global macro environment and potentially weak investment patterns among customers are the major headwinds. Competition from Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOand F5 Networks as well as delays in large projects are the other concerns.Juniper's outlook for the third quarter is encouraging. The company expects third-quarter revenues of approximately $1.250 billion (+/- $30 million), which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 billion.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be around 63% (+/- 0.5%). The company expects non-GAAP operating expenses of $500 million (+/- $5 million), and non-GAAP operating margin of 23%.Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range within 48 cents to 54 cents (mid-point 51 cents), much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Juniper will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 41 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.Zacks Rank:Juniper has a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.JUNIPER NETWRKS Price and EPS SurpriseJUNIPER NETWRKS Price and EPS Surprise|JUNIPER NETWRKS QuoteStock to ConsiderYou could consider the following stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Inovalon Holdings, Inc.INOV, with an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and Zacks Rank #1.

Apple (AAPL) Q4 Earnings Preview: Will it Beat Estimates?;10/20/2016;"Apple, Inc.AAPLis set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Oct 25. Last quarter, it posted a 2.16% positive earnings surprise. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.03%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Apple is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Apple has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP:The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.21%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.67 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.65.Zacks Rank:Apple carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (Rank #4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.APPLE INC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAPPLE INC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|APPLE INC QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected   Earnings?Since the beginning of this year, Apple has been on a rollercoaster ride given muted demand and sluggish macroeconomic conditions especially in China. Despite this, in the last reported quarter, the company managed to beat expectations on both counts.We expect the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter to be driven by recovering iPhone sales and robust upgrade cycles. Historically, the fourth quarter has been a strong one for Apple as the company launches its most important offerings during this time. This September, Apple launched the new iPhones (iPhone 7 and 7 Plus), which appear to be significantly better than their predecessors. The company also unveiled a newer version of Apple Watch in addition to providing updates on Apple Music, App Store and Apple Watch in addition to the software upgrades.Apple remains optimistic about growth in regions like India and a decent rebound in China. It has been taking initiatives like setting up R&D facilities to strengthen its foothold in China. A loyal customer base, a strong ecosystem and a robust installed base are the other positives.  Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices. The company has also been seeing strength in the number of switchers from Android and other operating systems to iOS.Apart from this, other revenue drivers to watch out for ahead of this quarter's results include sales from iPad, the App Store as well as Apple's other products division. Further, its collaborations with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and CiscoCSCOin the enterprise space are likely to be accretive to the fourth quarter and beyond.However, continued macroeconomic headwinds in some key regions amid increasing competition may pose some challenges.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Amazon.com Inc.AMZNhas an Earnings ESP of +6.98% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.Entergy CorporationETRhas an Earnings ESP of +11.64% and a Zacks Rank #2.Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Intel, Salesforce, Microsoft, Apple and Cisco;10/20/2016;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - October 20, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeIntel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report),Salesforce(NYSE:CRM-Free Report),Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) andCisco(NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst   Blog:What Intel Q3 Results Say About Tech Earnings This     QuarterIntel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report) had a good-ish third quarter. I say good-ish because the company managed to continue growing its PC-related business despite what IDC and Gartner had to say about continued declines. It also saw IoT revenue grow strongly and one can hope that in the not-too-distant future (hopefully 2017), its next-generation memory chips will make it to market.Data center revenue grew as well, but not as much as many were hoping. Drilling down further, it appears that enterprise remains the spoilsport while cloud is putting up a good fight to make up for this weakness.Significantly, while all costs declined as a percentage of sales sequentially as well as from last year, R&D and engineering costs were down substantially. CEO Brian Krzanich expressed satisfaction about management's ongoing restructuring program and said ""We… continue to realign our resources to our strategy."" True enough, non-PC businesses contributed nearly 53% of operating profit while generating around 43% of revenue in the last quarter.INTEL CORP Price and EPS Surprise|INTEL CORP QuoteIntel shares are sliding today as guidance for the upcoming quarter missed the Street's expectations.Here are five things I picked from the announcement that will hold true for other technology players as well:Earnings Beats May Not Mean Stock AppreciationInvestors this season have a lot of things on their minds what with the election coming up and the strong chances of a rate hike to follow soon thereafter. China growth concerns haven't helped matters (GDP is steady at 6.7% for the third straight quarter, which is the lowest rate in 25 years, but experts are betting this too will drop as the government takes measures to control escalating real estate prices).To top it all, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, reaching new highs just a couple of days ago. And as we all know, most tech companies sell a lot of stuff abroad so a stronger dollar just doesn't help.So this quarter, investors prefer a strong guidance to an earnings beat and shares of companies that fail on the former are going to be punished.PC Inventory BuildupBelieve it or not, companies supplying into the PC (that includes laptops and hybrids) market could see some inventory accumulation and consequently, weaker sales in the current quarter. IDC mentioned that ""Although we've now seen two consecutive quarters of strong market growth, we believe the strong market performance has less to do with strengthening demand and more to do with increased appetite from the channel for inventory"" and, ""We will need a strong holiday season to ensure that we don't enter 2017 in a poor inventory situation.""Check out what Intel says in explaining the below seasonal guidance for the client segment: ""we expect the worldwide PC supply-chain to reduce the inventory.""So the quarter is likely to see inventory corrections and some caution about spending on inventories that PC-exposed companies may experience.Growth Is Where the Cloud IsIntel management said that the cloud piece of its data center business grew 30%+ from the year-ago quarter compared to a 3% decline in the enterprise business. The enterprise softness is partly on account of companies moving their operations to the cloud. While this piece will remain a drag on results, it is expected to improve from the current position as some companies will be deploying private clouds.In general, tech companies with a cloud focus, such as and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM-Free Report), or those that are in rapid transition to it such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) and Intel or those that are primarily involved with connected/computing devices or services like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) will be beneficiaries.Realigning Costs with Strategic PrioritiesThis has become a common theme for a growing number of technology companies, particularly incumbents like Intel, Microsoft and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO-Free Report) over the past few years. These giants have implemented massive restructuring actions to adjust their products and revenue models with the reality of cloud computing. Efficient cost management if not total restructuring will remain important considerations for most players.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for free.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Will Cisco Systems Buy These 2 Security Companies?;10/19/2016;"Networking equipment giantCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) generates nearly half of its revenue from routers   and switches -- two highly commoditized, slow growth markets. Its   routing revenue fell 4% last year as its switching revenue stayed   flat. IDC also reports that Ciscoislosingmarket share in both markets to aggressive rivals likeHuawei.Image source: Getty.makeArticleAd();In response, Cisco has been investing heavily in higher growth   businesses like service provider video, collaboration, and   security solutions. Security is the fastest growing business of   the three, posting 13% annual sales growth last quarter and   accounting for 4% of Cisco's top line.Over the past few years, Cisco beefed up that business by   acquiring security companies like threat protection firms   ThreatGRID, SourceFire, OpenDNS, and Lancope. But looking ahead,   many analysts expect Cisco to dip into its free cash flow ($12.4   billion over the past 12 months) and make additional purchases   across the cybersecurity sector. Let's take a closer look at the   two most likely targets.FireEyeFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) is frequently cited as a takeover target for   Cisco, since it's a ""best in breed"" threat prevention firm which   was  notably the first cybersecurity company to be certified   by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Buying FireEye would   strengthen Cisco's security portfolio, and the company could   bundle all these technologies directly into its networking   hardware and software. These bundles could widen its moat against   rivals like Huawei andHPE.FireEye hasplunged 60%over the past 12 months due to slowing sales growth, jarring   management changes, and its alarming cash burn rate. But it now   has a fairly low enterprise value of $1.9 billion -- not a bad   price for a company that generated $623 million in revenues last   year. Moreover, FireEye's revenues are  still expected to   rise 16% this year and 15% next year. FireEye is unprofitable,   but its operating costs would probably decline dramatically after   being integrated into Cisco's security unit.However, FireEyereportedly rebuffedseveral takeover attempts earlier this year, because its    suitors offered less than the $30 per share (140% higher   than its current price) it wanted. It's also believed that Kevin   Mandia, the company's new CEO, is less interested in selling the   company than his predecessor, David DeWalt.Image source: Getty.ImpervaOver the summer, several reports claimed that Cisco's channel   partners were urging it to buyImperva(NYSE: IMPV) ,the leaderin  the niche market of web application firewalls (WAF)   which shield individual apps from specialized attacks. Sandler   Research estimates that the WAF market could grow at a compound   annual growth rate of 17.3% between 2014 and 2019.Speaking toCRN, an unnamed Cisco Gold solution provider suggested that    buying Imperva would help Cisco ""fill in some key holes""   toward becoming an end-to-end security provider. Greg Kushto,   director of Security and Enterprise Networks at Force 3, also   toldCRNthat Imperva excels in areas where Cisco is weak, including data   security, encryption, and data masking.Like FireEye, shares of Imperva have slumped nearly 30% over   the past 12 months due to slowing sales growth, mainly attributed   to extended sales cycles and the smaller size of larger   purchases. Analysts expect Imperva's sales to rise less than 7%   this year to $250 million before possibly accelerating back to   20% next year.But unlike FireEye, Imperva is still trying to sell itself.Bloombergclaims that Cisco andIBMhave both expressed interest in buying the company, which has a   fairly low enterprise value of $1.3 billion. Imperva also faces   pressure from activist investor Elliot Associates, which holds    a stake of nearly 10% in the company, to explore ""strategic   and operational opportunities"" like a potential sale.Will Cisco buy these companies?It seems more likely for Cisco to buy Imperva than FireEye,   since it's actually looking to sell. But I also wouldn't rule out   a hostile bid for FireEye, since the company is much cheaper than   many of its peers with an EV/Sales ratio of around 3. Imperva,   for example, has an EV/Sales ratio of 5.Investors should never buy a struggling company in   anticipation of a buyout, but FireEye and Imperva's ""best in   breed"" strengths and beaten-down prices could be too tempting for   companies like Cisco to ignore.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

These giants have implemented massive restructuring actions to adjust their products and revenue models with the reality of cloud computing. Efficient cost management if not total restructuring will remain important considerations for most players.Conservatism All the WayIrrespective of what investors may be asking for, companies too have headaches because of changing market conditions, fresh competition from niche players and market saturation such as in the case of PCs. Finding new use cases for their technology is another challenge. So companies are likely to guide conservatively.ConclusionSince there are a large number of growth stocks in the sector, multiples are often inflated. The rich valuation can be a deterrent to investment particularly since there is some uncertainty about the future payback of investments. But post earnings pullbacks may be just the way to get into a stock.Many semiconductor, Internet retail or other Internet stocks are ripe for the buying. But choosing can be a risky business.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Provides Spinoff Details, '17 View;10/19/2016;"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.HPE, in its recent Securities Analyst Meeting, discussed details about the previously announced spinoff of its Enterprise Services (ES) and software business. Moreover, the company provided its fiscal 2017 outlook while reaffirming the fiscal 2016 guidance.The SplitIn September, the company announced its decision to spin off its software business and merge the same with British software firm, Micro Focus International Plc, in a cash-stock deal worth $8.8 billion.The transaction, which is subject to some regulatory approvals, is anticipated to be tax free for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Per the agreement, the company will receive $2.5 billion in cash and a 50.1% stake in the merged entity, currently estimated to be valued at $6.3 billion.Earlier in May, Hewlett Packard Enterprise had announced the spin-off its struggling IT services segment - Enterprise Services - and entered into an agreement to merge the same with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). The transaction, which is scheduled to close in Mar 2017, will deliver approximately $8.5 billion to the company's shareholders on an after-tax basis. This includes $4.5 billion in the form of equity in the combined company, $1.5 billion in cash dividend and $2.5 billion of debt assumption.HPE's 2017 ProjectionsThe company provided full year 2017 outlook in three parts, taking into account the spin off-merger of its ES and Software business with Computer Sciences and Micro Focus, respectively.Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects combined non-GAAP earnings (including contribution from ES and Software business) for full year 2017 in the range of $2.00 to $2.10 per share. Revenues for the same period are expected to be flat to down 1%. Free cash flow is projected to be roughly $3.6 billion to $3.6 billion for full year 2017.The company provided its non-GAAP earnings guidance (which included partial year contributionsfrom ES and Software business) for full year 2017 in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Free cash flow is projected to be negative $1.8 billion for full year 2017, mainly due to pension funding payment. The company however anticipates returning $3 billion in fiscal 2017 and anticipates net operating cash balance to be roughly $8 billion.The company also provided its non-GAAP earnings guidance for full year 2017 on completion of the ESand Software deals (excludingthe contributions from both ES and Software business). Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.35. Revenues for the same period is expected to grow modestly. Free cash flow is projected to be approximately $2.1 to 2.4 billion for full year 2017.Fiscal 2016 Outlook ReaffirmedHewlett Packard Enterprise reiterated its fiscal 2016 outlook.  The company continues to expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be $1.90-$1.95 (mid-point: $1.925). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.88. Revenues for the same period are expected to increase in a range of 1% to 2%.The company continues to anticipate returning $3 billion in fiscal 2016 and expects to deliver free cash flow of $1.7 to $1.9 billion in 2016.HEWLETT PKD ENT PriceHEWLETT PKD ENT Price|HEWLETT PKD ENT QuoteConclusionWe believe Hewlett Packard Enterprise can tap opportunities owing to the improving server market in the long run. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's massive restructuring moves will complement its focus on core businesses and enable it to compete with players like Oracle ( ORCL), Cisco ( CSCO) and NetApp ( NTAP) as well as the new entrant, Dell going forward.Furthermore, the company has done considerably well in the enterprise class server and storage markets. The company concentrates its resources on the high-margin software and security markets as well.

3 Top Stocks for Your Roth IRA;10/19/2016;"Image source: Getty Images.Building up a nest egg only to have it taxed into oblivion at   retirement is a problem that a Roth IRA solves. Contributions   aren't deductible, but that money grows tax-free, potentially for   decades, and withdrawals after reaching the required age are free   and clear of any taxes or penalties.makeArticleAd();Both capital gains and dividends can accumulate tax-free in a   Roth IRA, a fact that makes some stocks better than others. We   asked three of our contributors to discuss a stock that would be   a perfect fit for a Roth IRA due to their growth potential.   Here's what they had to say.Putting my mouth where my money isTyler Crowe:I guess there is no better way to suggest a company for a   Roth IRA than to say that it is a holding in my own Roth IRA:Waste Management(NYSE: WM) . What makes Waste Management a compelling stock to   own in a Roth is two fold. The first is that it is a business   that is likely to be around for a long time. The waste handling   business is extremely difficult to disrupt because of the amount   of capital needed to get a business large enough to compete.   Then, there is the tricky regulatory and slightly political   aspect that gives established business a big advantage -- think   trying to get the permits for a new landfill. With that   competitive advantage platform, Waste Management has built a   business that generates high rates of return and uses those   returns to reward shareholders.So Waste Management's business certainly has the qualities you   want for a long-term holding in a retirement account. The other   reason this one is worth adding to a Roth IRA is you get to use   the tax advantages of the account to benefit even more from the   company's dividend. While the company's 2.6% dividend yield today   won't wow anyone, the company has grown its payout at a decent   clip of 6.5% annually over the past 12 years and has bought back   24% of all shares outstanding over that time frame. The efforts   from the company to increase shareholder value through these   means and thebenefits of reinvested dividendsin a tax advantaged account can do wonders for your retirement   portfolio. That's why I own it in my Roth IRA, and why you should   consider it as well.Everyone should own at least one rare disease drugmakerGeorge Budwell:Novel drugs or therapies that target rare diseases are   perhaps the most coveted types of assets within the high growth   pharmaceutical industry. The basic issue at play is that   so-called ""orphan"" drugs, or drugs indicated for diseases that   afflict fewer than 200,000 people, come with a variety of   benefits for their manufacturers, including premium prices,   little to no push back from payers, extended periods of   exclusivity, tax breaks, and arguably less competition, depending   on the indication. Orphan drugs, on balance, also tend to require   far less capital to bring to market, enabling their manufacturers   to avoid taking on the unsightly amount of debt that frequently   plagues small to mid-sized biopharmas.With these advantages in mind, I think the mid-cap orphan drug   specialistBioMarin(NASDAQ: BMRN) would be a great stock to sock away in a Roth IRA.   BioMarin presently has five drugs on the market for orphan   indications, such as the carbohydrate processing disorder Morquio   A, as well as for Phenylketonuria, a condition characterized by a   person's inability to break down the amino   acid phenylalanine. BioMarin also sports an exciting   clinical pipeline of high-value orphan drug candidates for   conditions like short-limbed dwarfism and hemophilia A.Aside from BioMarin's diverse product portfolio and clinical   pipeline, the company is also set to post some of the highest   levels of revenue growth within the pharmaceutical industry.   Specifically, the drugmaker's top line is forecast to grow by   over 26% this year, and by more than 18% in 2017. And if you   throw in the fact that BioMarin has relatively little leverage on   its balance sheet, with a modest debt to equity ratio of 34.9%,   this stock looks, like a superb growth vehicle to hold for the   long haul.A bargain tech dividend stockTim Green:The ideal stock for a Roth IRA is one that pays a hearty dividend   and has the potential to appreciate in value over the long run.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , the dominant leader in the networking hardware   market, checks both boxes.Cisco is undergoing a transformation, shifting away from being   a seller of hardware and toward being a provider of solutions.Software and serviceswill be the key to the company's growth going forward, with areas   like security and collaboration offsetting slow growth in the   switching and routing businesses. In fiscal year 2016, while the   switching business was flat and the routing business suffered a   small revenue decline, security and collaboration grew by 13% and   9%, respectively.What makesCisco stockenticing is a pessimistic valuation and a nice dividend. Analysts   expect Cisco to produce adjusted EPS of $2.43 in fiscal year   2017, putting the forward P/E ratio at just 12.5. If you value   the net cash on Cisco's balance sheet fully and back it out, that   ratio drops to just 9.5. Add to that low valuation a dividend   yield of 3.4%, and the result is a stock that deserves a place in   your Roth IRA.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

The 3 Biggest Challenges Facing Cisco Systems;10/18/2016;"Networking giantCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) isn't a high growth stock, but it's generally   considered a solid income play which delivers fairly predictable   returns in volatile markets. Cisco's P/E of 14 is lower than the   industry average of 25 for networking equipment companies, and   its forward yield of 3.5% is higher than the S&P 500's   average yield of 2.1%.Image source: Cisco.makeArticleAd();While those numbers will likely set a floor under Cisco's   stock, a few headwinds could also prevent it from moving much   higher. Let's discuss three of those biggest challenges.1. Competition in switches and routersCisco is the world's largest vendor of ethernet switches and   routers. However, it's been losing market share in both markets   to rivals likeHuaweiandHPE(NYSE: HPE) . IDC reported that between the first and    second quarters of 2016, Cisco's share of the switching   market fell from 59% to 56.8%, and its share of the combined   router and service provider market slipped from 48.8% to   44.8%.That's a big problem, since Cisco's combined switches and   routers revenue accounted for nearly half  of its top line   last year. In the past, Cisco marginalized smaller rivals like   Aruba Networks with aggressive hardware and software bundling   tactics. But now that many of the smaller players have either   been beaten or acquired, larger companies are striking back with   their own bundling plays.Huawei, the largest wireless infrastructure company in the   world, is leveraging that leading market position to sell   switches and routers to telcos and large businesses. HPE, which    acquired Aruba last year to increase its scale in both   switches and routers, is also bundling its networking hardware   with various other IT services.2. The rise of cloud networkingA newer challenge for Cisco is the rise of cloud networking   solutions which rely more on software instead of hardware. These   platforms, also known as SDN (software-defined networking) ones,   are often more cost efficient and scalable than older   hardware-based networks.Last year, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha declared   that  SDN platforms will simplify networking, hurt demand   for Cisco's traditional networking equipment, and ""shrink gross   profit dollars for the networking stack."" Guggenheim analyst Ryan   Hutchinson also warned that Cisco's outlook was clouded by   ""uncertainty around future network architectures as more   workloads migrate to the cloud.""Image source: Getty Images.Cisco's biggest adversary in this space isArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) , which has posted double-digit sales growth for   seven straight quarters. Cisco has tried to slow Arista down    with patent infringement lawsuits, which resulted in import   bans on some of its products. The International Trade Commission   and U.S. Trade Representative both  upheld that ban earlier   this year in separate rulings. That ban throws a few hurdles in   Arista's way, but it might not prevent Cisco from falling behind   a crucial tech curve.3. Inorganically growing its security businessCisco's security revenue rose 13% last year, making it the   company's fastest growing business. While the business merely   accounted for 4% of its top line, Cisco has been aggressively   growing it by acquiring cybersecurity firms like ThreatGRID,   SourceFire, OpenDNS, and Lancope. That growth makes Cisco an   oft-cited threat to smaller cybersecurity companies. However,   many smaller players have ""best in breed"" reputations in certain   markets which Cisco lacks.For example,Palo Alto Networks'(NYSE: PANW) firewalls are  approved by a large number of   agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense. Threat   prevention firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) was the  first cybersecurity company to be   certified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Therefore, instead of developing better security platforms   than these leaders, Cisco might need to acquire them instead.   That's why there are persistent rumors about Cisco buying smaller   players like FireEye orImperva. However, many of these companies aren't profitable and are   trading at high valuations -- meaning that Cisco's cybersecurity   expansion could be costly relative to the actual revenue and   profits it generates.Is Cisco still a worthy investment?I believe that Cisco is still a solid long-term investment,   thanks to its dominant position in the networking market, growth   opportunities in the Internet of Things and across 5G networks,   and expansion into higher growth markets like service provider   video, collaboration, and security solutions. However, I also   believe investors should carefully evaluate these headwinds,   which could cause Cisco's top line growth to remain stagnant over   the next few years.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Cisco Systems;10/18/2016;"AtHoldings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 20 most recent 13F filings for the 09/30/2016 reporting period, and noticed that Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) was held by 13 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose theirlongpositions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose theirshortpositions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the storybecause the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.makeArticleAd();Having given that caveat, we believe that looking atgroupsof 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in CSCO positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:FundNew Position?Change In Share CountChange In Market Value($ in 1000's)Putnam FL Investment Management Co.NEW+32,112+$1,019Northwest Investment Counselors LLCExisting+130+$242DORCHESTER WEALTH MANAGEMENT CoExisting-755+$383Hedeker Wealth LLCExisting-38,669+$52,373New Mexico Educational Retirement BoardExisting-77,200-$673WESPAC Advisors LLCNEW+50,118+$1,590Guinness Asset Management LtdExisting+23,230+$1,585Guinness Atkinson Asset Management IncExisting-36,180-$489Kessler Investment Group LLCExisting+8,959+$521Skylands Capital LLCExisting-1,400+$298Bach Investment Advisors LtdExisting-22,000-$698Capital Investment Advisors LLCExisting+43,435+$2,040Hengehold Capital Management LLCExisting+96+$28Aggregate Change:-18,124+$58,219In terms of shares owned, we count 5 of the above funds having increased existing CSCO positions from 06/30/2016 to 09/30/2016, with 6 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions.Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the CSCO share count in the aggregate amongallof the funds which held CSCO at the 09/30/2016 reporting period (out of the 340 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of CSCO shares those same funds held back at the 06/30/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for CSCO. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 2,388,657 shares in the aggregate, from 110,085,222 up to 112,473,879 for a share count increase of approximately 2.17%.

Interesting June 2017 Stock Options for CSCO;10/17/2016;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the June 2017 expiration for CSCO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $25 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 72 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.9% return against the $25 commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSCO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 17.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $24.28 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 72 cents from $25), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.3% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annualized 4.3% figure actually exceeds the 3.4% annualized dividend paid by Cisco Systems, Inc., based on the current share price of $30.32. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 17.55% to reach the $25 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for CSCO below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.4% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the June 2017 expiration, for shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $33 strike and collecting the premium based on the 87 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 4.3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 7.8% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $33 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CSCO shares would have to advance 8.8% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 11.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Cisco Systems, Inc., highlighting in green where the $25 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $33 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June 2017 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cisco Systems, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading dayCSCO historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $30.32) to be 23%.Top YieldBoost CSCO Calls »"

Infosys' (INFY) Q2 Earnings Meet, Stock Down on View Cut;10/17/2016;"makeZacksArticleAd();Infosys Ltd.INFYreported second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per American Depository Share of 24 cents. Earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and rose 3.8% on a year-over-year basis.Infosys' shares fell nearly 6% at the close of the regular trading session on Friday. Downcast revenue forecast, on account of macroeconomic uncertainties, disappointed investors. As companies worldwide are curtailing their IT spending and shifting to cloud-based software services, Infosys remains under pressure.While decent revenue growth drove the year-over-year bottom-line performance, foreign currency volatility proved to be a headwind.Quarterly DetailsRevenues increased 8.2% year over year to $2,587 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,608 million. Moreover, in terms of constant currency, revenues were up 8.9%.Top-line growth was largely supported by lucrative contract wins, the Renew-New strategy, growth in delivery services and enhanced operational efficiency. Improvement in client relationships and better employee engagement also contributed to the overall quarterly performance.Infosys' operating profit climbed 5.6% year over year to $644 million. Management believes that strong focus on operational improvement boosted the company's operating profits in the quarter.Geographical & Industry-wise PerformanceThe company witnessed growth in all the four regions where it operates. Second-quarter sales in India, Rest of the World, North America and Europe improved about 29.1%, 6.5%, 2.6% and 1.1% sequentially, respectively.Each of the four reporting segments of the company registered modest growth. The Energy, Utilities, Communications & Services and Banking & Financial Services, Insurance division emerged as the biggest gainers, wherein revenues rose 6.9% and 4.6% on a sequential basis, respectively. While revenues in the Manufacturing & Hi-Tech division grew 2.1% sequentially, they remained relatively flat at the Retail & Life Sciences division on a sequential basis.Notable Development during the QuarterInfosys has been diligently following the ""Renew New"" program, which lays the blueprint of its long-term growth. Under the ""Renew"" initiative, the company strengthened its relationships with existing ""core services"" clients, clinched some notable deals and leveraged on the Infosys Mana & Zero Distance programs, to drive innovation. Companies like AMD, Global Production Services and Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCOhave benefitted from the Infosys Mana platform.Under the ""New"" initiative, Infosys is working closely with the U.S.-based conglomerate - General Electric CompanyGE- to foster co-development of new applications with advanced Artificial Intelligence.Moreover, most of Infosys' businesses, including Panaya, Skava & EdgeVerve software products, delivered robust performance in the quarter. This, in turn, supplemented both the top and bottom lines. The company's three distinguished offerings - Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge-based IT and Design Thinking - are proving to be key profit churners, helping the company expand its market share. These services continued to gain solid traction by way of renewals.INFOSYS LTD Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseINFOSYS LTD Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|INFOSYS LTD QuoteDuring the reported quarter, Infosys launched a modular e-commerce platform - Skava Commerce. This platform is expected to aid clients in improving their omni-channel experiences. Currently, Infosys is aiding the IT infrastructure transformation of companies like - California-based shoe seller, Toms Shoes and payment processing and technology provider, Vantiv - by leveraging on the Skava platform.Also, Infosys' Panaya platform has gained a major client - Swiss retail trade and wholesale giant, The COOP Group. Similarly, EdgeVerve delivered a sturdy performance, ending the quarter with 48 wins and 23 go-lives from both the Finacle and Edge suite of solutions across various markets.LiquidityAs of Sep 30, 2016, Infosys had cash & cash equivalents of $4,763 million, compared with $4,566 million recorded as of Sep 30, 2015.Guidance SlashedInfosys, considered as a gauge for the health of the $3-trillion global enterprise spending market, trimmed its guidance for revenue growth this fiscal year to 8%-9%, from the previous expectation of 10%−11.5%.To ConcludeInfosys' delivered a commendable financial performance amidst formidable macroeconomic headwinds. The IT industry is in the middle of a transformation where business enterprises are increasingly adopting state-of-the-art software and impeccable Artificial Intelligence. Infosys' future prospects largely depend on its ability to align itself with this changing environment. Currently, the company is steadily shifting its focus from ""cost-based, people-only model"" to software plus services model, in order to take advantage of the changing market scenario.Despite Infosys' diligent efforts, the downcast outlook signals rough days, at least in the near term. Rapid proliferation of customizable Internet-based software has been hurting Infosys' traditional outsourcing business, thus thwarting growth. Management believes that economic conditions in many of its markets remain quite challenging.For instance, in many European countries, large government deficits, along with downgrading of government debt and credit ratings, have compounded the possibility of sustained weakness. This would adversely affect the company's growth going ahead. Reduced IT spending, in response to the challenging economic environment, has led to increased pricing pressure from clients, marring the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company's prospects.A better-ranked stock in the industry is Barracuda Networks, Inc.CUDA, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The California-based security and storage solutions provider has an excellent earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.

2 Rock-Solid Internet of Things Stocks With P/Es Under 15;10/16/2016;"The Internet of Things (IoT), the connection of various   objects to ""the cloud"" and to each other, is one of the hottest   growth markets in the tech sector today.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) predicts that the number of connected devices   worldwide will double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion in   2025. IDC expects the market to  grow from $655.8 million in   2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020.Those bullish expectations have inflated the valuations of   many IoT-related stocks, making it hard to find ""cheap"" plays on   this growing market. So today, I'll introduce two companies that   will profit from the growth of the IoT market but still trade   with fairly low P/E ratios below 15.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Juniper NetworksJuniper Networks'(NYSE: JNPR) networking hardware and software connect IoT   devices to each other, but it's often overshadowed by larger   rival Cisco. IDC says Cisco controlled 56.8% of the global   ethernet switching market in the second quarter this year.   Juniper only controlled a single-digit share of that market, but   it's much stronger in the combined service provider and routers   market, where it held a 15.7% share against Cisco's 44.8%.Juniper's revenue rose 5% last year, and is expected to rise   1% this year and 4% next year. Cisco's sales, which stayed flat   last year, are expected to grow 1% this year and 3% next year.   Near-term headwinds, like slower enterprise spending, are   throttling both companies' top-line growth. But looking ahead,   the growth of the IoT and new 5G networks should still fuel their   long-term growth.Cisco,HPE,Huawei, andArista Networksare all tough rivals, but Juniper has been widening its moat by   acquiring other companies and securing big contracts. To   strengthen its service provider business, Juniper acquired cloud   and  metro networking provider BTI Systems earlier this   year. It also agreed to buy  Aurrion, a developer of silicon   photonics technology which reduces the costs of its networking   systems. Last month,British Airwayschose Juniper to expand its cloud and core networks.Juniper's earnings rose 40% in 2015, but soft router and   security sales are expected to cause earnings to fall 2% this   year. After those businesses stabilize, growth is expected to   return with a 9% rebound next year. Both Juniper and Cisco trade   at 14 times earnings, which is much lower than the  industry   average of 25 for networking equipment companies.Silver Spring NetworksSilver Spring Networks(NYSE: SSNI) sells ""smart grid"" products that transmit data   between electric meters, EV charging stations, smart thermostats,   and in-house displays to run smart cities. Its top customers   include major utility companies likeConsolidated Edison(NYSE: ED) ,Pacific Power, andAmerican Municipal Power.Image source: Getty Images.Research firm Markets and Markets believes that the   smart-cities market will grow from $312 billion to $758 billion   between 2015 and  2020. Silver Springs' sales surged 47% in   2015. Silver Springs' top line is expected to grow 7% in 2016,   then accelerate to 13% growth in 2017. Last quarter, Silver   Spring reported that its number of cumulative network endpoints   had risen 13% annually to 24.3 million.To expand its margins, Silver Spring is pivoting toward   cloud-based services to reduce the amount of hardware that    needs to be installed across its smart grids. That shift, along   with its expanding scale, helped it post a full-year profit in   2015 following several years of annual losses. The company   expects sales to accelerate in the second half of the year, and   analysts expect its earnings to grow 67% this year and another   93% in fiscal 2017.Those growth estimates look robust, but Silver Spring trades   at just 10 times earnings and the stock has fallen about 5% this   year. There's not a simple explanation for this lack of investor   interest, but it's likely due to the fact that it's a small-cap   stock and concerns that it might be marginalized by larger grid   rivals likeGeneral Electricand Cisco. But then again, its low enterprise value of $600   million, low valuation, clean balance sheet, and well-established   customer base make it a lucrative buyout target for those larger   players. However, buying a stock based on the possibility of a   buyout would not be wise.The bottom lineInvestors shouldn't simply buy a stock because it has a low   P/E.

3 Cheap Tech Stocks With Dividends Over 3%;10/13/2016;"The rapidly changing tech landscape abounds with fantastic   opportunity to transform tired legacy businesses into providers   of cutting-edge solutions to meet new customer demands. Which is   exactly whatHP(NYSE: HPQ) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) , andCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) are doing -- all while paying stellar dividends to   shareholders.One of the reasons HP, along with IBM and Cisco, offers such   tremendous value along with strong dividends is the impatience of   some investors. The transitions HP, IBM, and Cisco are in the   midst of take time, which some investors simply aren't willing to   give. This situation creates a great opportunity for investors   with years in mind, rather than weeks or months.makeArticleAd();Image source: HP.Patience is a virtueAs HP demonstrated last quarter, the PC is not dead. Led by a   12% jump in net revenue from notebooks, to $4.3 billion, which   offset a 9% decline in desktop earnings, the company's personal   systems segment sales soared 7% sequentially, to $7.51   billion.In addition to its spot as the No. 1 PC manufacturer in the   U.S. market, HP sold 12.96 million units in 2016's second   calendar quarter, which was a 5.1% improvement compared to a year   ago, increasing the company's global market share to 20.8% --   just a whisker behindLenovo's 21.2%. HP is winning in the PC wars by targeting niche   markets. The new Omen PC, complete with virtual-reality-ready   capabilities, is an ideal example.HP is following the same targeted strategy in its printing   unit. The $1.05 billion acquisition ofSamsung's printing and copier division combines Samsung's   multifunction printers with HP's PageWide technology, creating a   less expensive all-in-one printing-and-copier solution for   commercial customers. The 3D printing market -- an estimated $13   billion opportunity by 2018 -- is another niche HP is   pursuing.A share price at just seven times trailing earnings, combined   with the company's 3.2% dividend yield, warrants HP a spot on a   list of cheap dividend-paying tech stocks.Image source: IBM.Still a bargainIBM stock is up 12% year to date, which is a nice change for   shareholders. Despite its share-price run, IBM still trades at   less than 11 times forward earnings, and boasts a 3.65% dividend.   The guarded optimism surrounding IBM is due to the performance of   its ""strategic imperatives,"" which include cloud, Internet of   Things (IoT), cognitive computing, mobile, and data security.Strategic imperatives generated $8.3 billion of IBM's $20.2   billion total revenue last quarter, good for a year-over-year   gain of 12%. Over the past 12 months, strategic imperatives   accounted for $30.7 billion, equal to 38% of total sales. CEO   Ginni Rometty's plan was to boost IBM's core unit sales to 40% of   revenue annually by 2018.With third-quarter earnings slated for release on Oct. 17, IBM   may prove to have hit its key revenue mark well ahead of   Rometty's initial target. Leading the way are IBM's cloud sales,   which ballooned to an annual run rate of $11.6 billion last   quarter. IBM's strategy of incorporating its cognitive computing   wonder Watson, IoT services, data security, and mobile solutions   into the cloud is spot-on. That strategy, coupled with the   company's targeting of specific industries, will continue to   serve IBM shareholders well.Image source: Cisco.Change is goodWhen Chuck Robbins took over as CEO in 2015, Cisco needed to   change from relying on old-school enterprise routers and switches   to focusing on IoT, the cloud, security, and data center sales.   And the change is working.Two of Cisco's top-performing divisions last fiscal year were   collaboration and security, climbing 9% and 13%, respectively.   Strong performance across the networking company's key business   areas, along with shaving over $600 million in operating expenses   in fiscal 2016, improved Cisco's gross margins and drove an   impressive 21% earnings-per-share jump, to $2.11.The changes Cisco is undergoing also include cutting 5,500   jobs, equal to about 7% of its global workforce, which has made   some investors nervous. The realignment of its engineering   division, including the pending departure of Cisco's CTO, may   have also spooked some folks. One thing that hasn't changed is   Cisco's sky-high dividend of nearly 3.5%. Cisco is a cheap,   high-yield stock deserving of a long, hard look.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Energy was off 0.4% as US oil futures were down about 1.1% to $50.24 a barrel.On the Dow, 16 components were higher and 14 were lower when the session wrapped up. Nike (NKE) posted the best gain, adding 1.2% while Cisco Systems (CSCO) was the leading decliner, falling 2.3%.makeArticleAd();Members of the FOMC saw a stronger case for a rate hike in last month's monetary policy meeting, with near-term risks to the economic outlook appearing ""roughly balanced,"" according to minutes released on Wednesday afternoon. The probability of a December hike held steady on the CME Group's FedWatch tool, with a likelihood of about 64% that the rate will rise to 0.5% to 0.75%.The day's other economic release showed the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey with 5.443 million open positions, down from a revised 5.831 million in July, and below estimates for 5.724 million job openings.Thursday's calendar has initial weekly jobless claims and September import and export prices at 8:30 a.m. ET with the September Treasury Budget due at 2 p.m. Fed speakers include Philadelphia President Patrick Harker on the economic outlook at 12:15 p.m. and Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari at 9 p.m.Here's where the markets stood by the close:US MARKETSDow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.54 points (+0.09%)S&P 500 was up 2.45 points (+0.11%)Nasdaq Composite Index was down 7.77 points (-0.15%)GLOBAL SENTIMENTFTSE 100 was down 0.66%Nikkei 225 was down 1.09%Hang Seng Index was down 0.6%Shanghai China Composite Index was down 0.22%UPSIDE MOVERS(+) VOXX (+49.02%) Swings to a Q2 profit on higher revenues(+) CUDA (+9.17%) Reported better-than-expected Q2 EPS and revenue(+) IPCI (+5.3%) Signed an exclusive license and commercial supply agreement with Mallinckrodt (MNK)(+) SMG (+2.18%) Study shows rising support for marijuana legalization ahead of November electionDOWNSIDE MOVERS(-) ERIC (-20.83%) Warns Q3 results will be significantly lower than expectations(-) FTNT (-10.15%) Cut Q3 revenue and earnings guidance(-) RXII (-9.47%) Enters into exclusive option deal to acquire MirImmune, plans securities offering(-) NOK (-5.57%) Testing 5G technologies in North America with U.S. Cellular"

Midday Update: Stocks Erase Losses But Remain Cautious Before Sept FOMC Minutes;10/12/2016;"Wall Street reversed Wednesday's earlier losses but was only modestly higher as investors remain cautious ahead of the minutes of the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and with oil trading lower for a second consecutive day.Stocks were trading lower at the open but corrected to the upside on a larger-than-expected decline in August job openings and remarks from NY Fed President William Dudley, both of which helped extinguish rate hike jitters. The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.443 million open positions, down from a revised 5.831 million in July, and below estimates for 5.724 million job openings.And speaking at a ""fireside chat"" in Albany NY, Dudley said that the U.S. economic expansion still has more upside, and that the Fed can afford to gradually lift accommodation. While his comments were not out of character for one of the Fed's most dovish members, it amplified the rebound that was already underway across the benchmark averages.makeArticleAd();Of the eleven S&P 500 sectors, the energy, healthcare and materials sectors continue to trade in the red. Dow component stocks Cisco (CSCO) and Microsoft (MSFT) were leading decliners but with broader losses mitigated by gains in Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE).In related markets, gold was slightly lower, the dollar was stronger against the yen and euro, and Treasury yields were three basis points higher in the belly and long-end of the yield curve.European indices all closed lower with the UK's FTSE-100 underperforming as a result of pressure on the energy sector, as well as a considerable rebound in sterling. Shares of Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC) weighed on the Euro-Stoxx along with the broader telecom sector, though losses were mitigated by gains in the Italian banking sector.Crude oil was down $0.75 to $50.05 per barrel. Natural gas was down $0.01 to $3.23 per 1 million BTU. Gold was down $1.50 to $1,254.40 an ounce, while silver was down $0.03 to $17.48 an ounce.

Facebook, Inc.'s Workplace Platform Is Here -- And It's Priced Competitively;10/11/2016;"Image source: Facebook.Asexpected, social media giantFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) announced on Monday that its new workplace platform   is now live for ""any company or organization that wants to use   it."" Called Workplace, the collaboration platform aims to enable   more effective communication at work.makeArticleAd();Workplace enters a highly competitive market for enterprise   collaboration platforms, including names like the rapidly growing   Slack andCisco's Jabber, among others. Can Workplace stand out from the   incumbents?Introducing WorkplaceWhat is Workplace?""Workplace is a dedicated and secure space for companies to   connect, communicate and collaborate,"" Facebook says on the   frequently asked-questions portion of its Workplace website.   ""Organizations of all sizes can use familiar Facebook features   such as News Feed, groups, messages and events to get things   done.""As a comprehensive collaboration tool, Workplace can   essentially replace chat-based collaboration tools like Slack and   video conferencing platforms likeMiscrosoft's Skype.A key selling point is that the platform is ""easy to use   because it's based on familiar Facebook features,"" Facebook   asserts. Users can interact through products used on the original   Facebook platform, such as direct messages, posts, comments,   groups, tagging, live video, the News Feed, and more.Workplace. Image source: Facebook.Importantly, Workplace doesn't require a personal Facebook   account and is totally separate from a user's Facebook friends   and family.Facebook actually started testing Workplace over a year ago.   So it's had some time to fine-tune the offering. The company says   it now has more than 1,000 organizations using the platform.""People have created nearly 100,000 groups and the top five   countries using Workplace are India, the U.S., Norway, UK and   France,"" Facebook said in its announcement on Monday.Current customers using Workplace are wide ranging, including   companies likeStarbucks, Booking.com, Danone, YES Bank in India, and the Government   Technology Agency of Singapore.The business modelFacebook is already monetizing the platform, though not with   ads like it usually does. With the exception of non-profits and   educational institutions, which can use the platform free of   charge, Facebook is charging businesses between $1 and $3 per   monthly active user, depending on how many users a company has on   the platform. This pricing is aggressive, considering Slack costs   about $7 per user for its standard package.Further, if Facebook's decision to undercut the fastest   growing workplace collaboration app so significantly isn't   already enough evidence of how seriously the social network is   taking this new product, Facebook is also enlisting important   names, including companies like Deloitte, Sada Systems, and G   Suite to help customers move over to Workplace.Facebook explained this partnership in its announcement on   Monday:To help more companies get started with Workplace, we are     announcing the Workplace Partner Program, a group of technology     and professional service organizations such as Deloitte who     will work with us to bring Workplace to even more businesses     across the globe. This means that companies will have more ways     to access Workplace -- by working with our teams directly or     via our approved and trained partners.While it's too early to judge how meaningful this product will   be for Facebook, or whether or not it can successfully draw   customers away from existing collaboration platforms like Slack,   the company's running start clearly suggests the fast-growing   king of social networks intends to succeed in this market.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you       something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't       miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their       brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Best Stocks of 2016: Globant SA (GLOB) Emerges as Digital Transformation Leader;10/10/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsEditor's Note: This article is part of ourBest Stocks for 2016contest. Jon Markman's pick for the contest isGlobant SA(NYSE:GLOB)Software is changing the face of commerce and the small,   nimble companies using new technologies to shape user experiences   are reaping the rewards. That's the story ofGlobant SA(NYSE:GLOB), my pick forBest Stocks for 2016.makeArticleAd();You wouldn't expect a small creative company based in Buenos   Aires would be so sought after, yetCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO),The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO),Electronic Arts Inc.(NASDAQ:EA),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL),Southwest Airlines Co(NYSE:LUV) andotherlarge international companies have put their trust in Globant to   deliver innovative, nimble user experiences to customers all over   the world.Yet dig a little into the story and it makes more sense. With   operations in eight countries, GLOB stock has its finger on the   pulse of emerging social trends and the engineering prowess to   integrate contextually aware, personalized experiences using Big   Data and the Internet of Things.It's where commerce is going and Globant has become the clear   leader.Globant Looking GreatGlobant got its start in 2003, when it was founded by current   chief executive Martin Migoya and three friends. The small   startup's initial goal was to create software products, initially   in Latin America. Less than five years later however, the company   had already grown into a multimillion dollar, multinational   corporation with clients all over the world.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of       2016Growth has been impressive. In 2010 the company had sales of   just $57 million. By 2015, revenues were $253.8 million … and   there is no sign of slowdown.In August, GLOB stock reported second-quarter sales of $79.9   million, representing year-over-year growth of 31.9%. It guided   analysts to expect $80 million to $82 million in sales for the   third quarter. In aletter to shareholders, Martín Migoya, Globant's chief executive and co-founder   said:""The market continues to rely on the growth of digital   services' demand, where we maintain our positioning as leader.   This can be seen in a recent IDC MarketScape report, which   recognized us as a worldwide leader of digital strategy   consulting services.""That is a good place to invest because IDC expects the   worldwide market for digital strategy consulting will mushroom to$97 billion by 2019.Better still, Globant is well-positioned in the   fastest-growing part of the business. Digital related spend   should increase from about 50% of all IT and business related   spending to 80% as companies move briskly to the digital age   where outcomes are measurable. For spendthrift business managers   that is a big deal.Michael Versace, research director at IDC makes the case:""As digitization alters the nature of business, competition,   supply and servicing operations, a growing number of   organizations of all sizes and maturities will adopt elements of   a digital strategy to create and/or maintain a brand, product,   and operational advantage. As more firms adopt digital   strategies, consulting engagements must contain a larger digital   strategy services capability.""GLOB stock's growth strategy is an easy sell, and that's   before we've even expounded on its place within the Internet of   Things - perhaps you've heard of that global phenomenon that is   rapidly altering nearly every aspect of how everyday life gets   done? From the complexities of driverless automobiles to the   simplicities of having your living room lamp turn itself off when   you leave the room, the IOT revolution is here, and it is only   going to get bigger and more pervasive.GLOB Stock and the Internet of ThingsAccording to IDC, the global Internet of Things market will reach $1.7 trillion   by 2020. Yes, you read that right,trillion.Early on, most of the attention has been focused on the   connectivity of the actual products, such as devices, network   equipment and sensors. TheApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch and its components for example, or theFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) device you wear when you work out.The hidden value however, lies not in products but the service   providers that will help us navigate the physical and online   worlds with less friction and more joy. The company driving such   developments is Globant.Consider that most big companies today are like gorgeous   hotels with terrible customer service. There's a mismatch in the   way that they sell their products and the way they service those   products in the digital age. Globant helps its clients bridge   that gap between product and user experience.The company has a very unique way in which it meets the   demands of its clients to remain relevant and ahead of the curve   in these new and emerging digital technologies. Globant has   created12 creative studiosthat each focus on a very specific solution. Consumer Experience,   Wearables and IOT, Gaming, Enterprise, and Digital Content are   examples of a few of these. Each studio is full of IT   professionals who are experts in that field.Tesaro Inc (TSRO) Soars on Trial Data,       Analyst UpgradesDespite a hiccup early in the year, Globant has performed very   well yar-to-date, rising over 18% through early October - three   times more than the broad market.I selected it as one of my best ideas of 2016 based on its   strong sales growth and dominant position in the rapidly   expanding digital strategy consulting business. After another   outstanding quarter of growth, I expect GLOB to finish the year   strong.Jon Markman operates the investment firmMarkman Capital Insights.

The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $31 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 70 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.3% return against the $31 commitment, or a 17.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CSCO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems, Inc. sees its shares decline 1.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $30.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 70 cents from $31), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 17.9% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annualized 17.9% figure actually exceeds the 3.3% annualized dividend paid by Cisco Systems, Inc. by 14.6%, based on the current share price of $31.49. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 1.56% to reach the $31 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for CSCO below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.3% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the November expiration, for shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $32 strike and collecting the premium based on the 66 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 16.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 19.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $32 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CSCO shares would have to climb 1.6% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 3.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Cisco Systems, Inc., highlighting in green where the $31 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $32 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the November put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cisco Systems, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading dayCSCO historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $31.49) to be 23%.Top YieldBoost CSCO Calls »"

Cypress Plans to Lay Off Globally to Focus on Growth Areas;10/10/2016;"Cypress Semiconductor CorporationCYplans to cut 8% of its workforce or about 500 jobs globally.makeArticleAd();This layoff is part of the company's strategy of focusing more on growth areas, including the automotive chip business and the IoT segment.The restructuring announcement comes a few days after Cypress' CEO T.J. Rodgers was replaced by Hassane El-Khoury. Notably, El-Khoury had helped during the company's acquisition of chipmaker Spansion in 2015 and in the more recent purchase of Broadcom's internet of things operations.The $550-million Broadcom acquisition makes Cypress the only company in the space to have cutting-edge wireless radios, MCUs, memories and power management ICs for integrated IoT systems in its repertoire. The deal also makes Cypress a key player in the automotive and industrial IoT segments.The job cuts are expected to result in severance charge of about $40-$50 million in the third and the fourth quarters of 2016. However, cost savings to be achieved by this move were not revealed.We believe Cypress is well positioned to resolve its internal inefficiencies and setbacks. Further, we believe these streamlining initiatives will bolster the company's capital position, help Cypress to focus on growth areas, reduce expenses and drive operational efficiencies.Second-Quarter ResultsThe company reported a decent second quarter with both the top and the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's revenues of $456.4 million were up 7.4% sequentially, within management's guided range of $440.0-$470.0 million and slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $455.3 million.For the upcoming third quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $510.0-$514.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $524.9 million. Consolidated gross margin is expected to increase to 41.0%, depending on utilization, product and customer mix. The increase is driven by higher utilization, seasonal revenue increase and contribution from the wireless IoT business.CYPRESS SEMICON PriceCYPRESS SEMICON Price|CYPRESS SEMICON QuoteAbout CypressCypress is a semiconductor company that offers high-performance, mixed signal and programmable solutions.

Cisco, Palo Alto, Symantec Gear Up For Cloud Cybersecurity Shift;10/8/2016;"Cloud computing is reshaping the market for network security   technologies.While corporate America fretted over moving data to public   cloud computing infrastructure a few years ago, many companies   are now fine with it. In fact, in most high-profile   cyberattacks, cloud platforms were not part of the IT   infrastructure breached.As more business workloads shift to Amazon Web Services, part   ofAmazon.com(AMZN), andMicrosoft's (MSFT) Azure, spending on cloud cybersecurity is expected to rise.makeArticleAd();So it's no wonder that providers of security technologies are   rushing to make acquisitions.Cisco Systems(CSCO) in June acquired privately held CloudLock. In earlier deals,   Microsoft bought Adallom;Palo Alto Networks(PANW) snapped up CirroSecure;Imperva(IMPV )purchased Skyfence;  Blue Coat Systems grabbed   Elastica, withSymantec(SYMC) in turn acquiring Blue Coat;Barracuda Networks(CUDA) bought Sookasa; andFortinet(FTNT) purchased AccelOps.Mergers speculation and the the rise in cloud-based security   spending helped boost the 26 stocks in IBD's security software   industry group to a No. 34 ranking on Friday amongthe 197 industry group tracked by IBD, up from No. 146 at the start of the third quarter.Doubling Down On CASBMany of the acquisitions targeted the cloud access security   broker (CASB) market. CASB products act as a middleman between a   corporate network and cloud applications hosted externally.   CASB services extend company security policies and access control   to cloud apps, provide visibility into what software-as-a-service   (SaaS) apps are being used in a network, and maintain tight   restrictions on data transfer.""CASB is about securing the data that goes into the cloud and   is becoming a critical control of new apps that organizations are   using,"" said Jonathan Ho, an analyst at William Blair.IBD'S TAKE:Several cybersecurity stocks are on high alert for     investors thanks to Russian cyberattacks and Barracudaearnings.He says security firms like Palo Alto are selling CASB   products in tandem with their on-premise data center products.   ""It's an opportunity to upsell into your installed base of   customers,"" Ho added.CASB products might, for example, identify suspicious behavior   such as a person making multiple logins to cloud apps from   different locations, perhaps from a mobile device.""Security vendors are doubling down on the CASB market,"" said   Shaul Eyal, an analyst at Oppenheimer. He says they include   Microsoft, Symantec, Palo Alto, Fortinet,Check Point(CHKP), Imperva,Proofpoint(PFPT) and Barracuda Networks.Eyal says CASB will be most important in the SaaS market as   Microsoft Office 365,Salesforce.com(CRM),NetSuite(N) and other apps are increasingly accessed via the internet   cloud.""CASB is important because the use of SaaS applications means   more data is being stored outside an organization, adding more   risk"" that data will be stolen, he said.Only 5% of large organizations now use CASB products, but that   will grow to 85% by 2020, says market research firm Gartner.""CASB  covers what's called 'shadow IT,' when business   users go out and buy services without IT department sanctioning,   and lets the company recognize when that's happening and regain   control over the applications,""  Ho said.Secureworks andIBM(IBM) also sell CASB products, analysts say. And the CASB market   is rife with startups including BitGlass, CipherCloud, NetSkope,   Palerra and Skyhigh Networks, so more acquisitions are expected.   Still, CASB is new.""Where CASBs fall short is on effective integration with an   enterprise's existing security services, such as its identity   access management,"" said Joel Fishbein, an analyst at BTIG.Tackling The Encryption ProblemWhile CASB is just one cloud-related development in   next-generation security; there will be others, analysts say.In PwC's 2017 global information security report, 63% of   survey respondents said they now run IT services in the cloud, in   the survey's first year of asking that question.Research firm IDC says that enterprises now spend about 15% of   their security budget on cloud-related products. That'll rise to   33% by 2018, IDC says. Gartner estimates that spending for cloud   cybersecurity will grow at an annual rate of 19% from 2016   through 2019.According to a Citigroup survey of security professionals,   Cisco and Palo Alto were cited as the most ""strategic vendors""   for cloud security, while a Morgan Stanley report says   Proofpoint is ""ahead of the curve"" in cloud deployment.The Citigroup report, published in September, says that   most companies have about 30% to 40% of business workloads   outsourced to cloud service providers. So-called hybrid clouds,   with a mix of private and public infrastructure, will pose their   own set of challenges.""A lot of the challenges with the cloud revolve around the   need for managing encryption and data loss prevention,"" said   Robert Ayoub, an analyst at market research firm IDC. ""Companies   are evaluating what data really needs to be protected in the   cloud. It's not simple. Encryption is challenging, it's a hard   problem to tackle.""Need For Security Driving Cloud AdoptionOne big question is whether AWS, the leading provider of   infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), will sell more security   products of its own and compete directly with software security   companies. In the IaaS market, customers rent computers and data   storage via the Internet cloud. Microsoft's Azure is the No. 2   IaaS provider whileAlphabet's(GOOGL) Google is the third biggest.AWS has relied on third-party security partners, although it   recently rolled out its own web-application firewall.What's clear is that large companies are getting more   comfortable outsourcing business workloads to AWS and Microsoft's   Azure as security improves, said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley   analyst in a report.Weiss says cloud service providers typically encrypt data ""at   rest and in transit."" In addition, there's no way for hackers to   identify specific servers where data is stored because of public   cloud architectures. ""Our recent conversations with CIOs now   suggest security is a driver of cloud adoption,"" Weiss said in a   May report. ""Computing shifting to the cloud may mean that cloud   platform vendors themselves, such as Amazon and Microsoft,   are best positioned to provide the security functionality,"" he   added.While AWS and Microsoft could develop security products   internally, they also loom as potential acquirers, especially of   startups.Sandboxing, and Other Cloud AdvantagesThere are opportunities for incumbents in cloud cybersecurity,   analysts say.Security vendors typically sell stand-alone ""appliances"" that   house software, electronics and network tools. Analysts expect   more security companies to offer software-only, or ""virtualized""   versions of products sold through AWS or Microsoft Azure. Goldman   Sachs says demand may grow for virtual firewalls in the public   cloud in 2017.Proofpoint, an email security specialist, andFireEye(FEYE) have developed security-as-a-service platforms.CyberArk Software's products give employees or administrators   who have ""privileged accounts"" the ability to access computer   systems in public cloud settings. Barracuda has rolled out   offerings for Office 365 users in the public cloud.Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard says cloud-based   ""sandboxing"" could play a role in threat detection.Sandboxing technology, first from FireEye and now with many   suppliers, executes suspicious code in an isolated   environment to test if a program contains a virus or   malware. ""The malware problem is easier to solve in the   cloud, with a virtualized network to isolate infected hosts and   using cloud computing capacity to run algorithms to detect   malware,"" Pritchard said in a September report.Gartner analyst Lawrence Pingree says cloud-based services   usually offer a discount.""Cloud-based malware sandboxes have been introduced by many   firewall providers, and many are offered at a fraction of the   cost of leading standalone devices,"" Pingree said in an   email.Cloud-based sandboxing may play a role in identifying   so-called ""zero day"" threats. That's when hackers exploit   vulnerability in software code by infiltrating malware into   networks. The attacks are called ""zero day"" because developers   race the clock to patch security holes.A More Cautious Security Market""Enterprises will continue to invest in new cloud-oriented   products (virtual appliances), security-as-a-service products,   and new functionality, such as CASB,"" said Gabriela Borges, a   Goldman Sachs analyst in a report. ""We think incumbent vendors   will pick up the pace in investing in these areas, most likely   through M&A activity.""Spending on security has been growing amid tighter information   technology (IT) budgets.Corporate spending on security has been growing at about a 6%   annual rate while IT budgets have been flattish. Even so,   security remains only roughly 4% to 10% of overall IT budgets,   depending on the company size, analysts say.""You're just not going to get where security is 25% of the IT   budget,"" said IDC's Ayoub. ""There are just too many operational   pieces that are competing for resources.""After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many   companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private   networks and the internet and invested in threat detection   technologies. Firewalls block unauthorized traffic from   entering a private network by analyzing app ""signatures.""That uptick in ""crisis spending"" drove security software   stocks to fresh highs in mid-2015 as valuations soared. Security   stocks cooled through February, then started to rebound. IBD's   software-security industry group has climbed 45% off its February   low through Friday - bolstered by mergers and by management   comments made during earnings calls that spending could pick up   in late 2017. Higher government spending is expected to be one   catalyst.Price competition has intensified among providers following a   moderation of security spending in 2015 and into 2016, which   pressured margins, analysts say. Aside from the IT infrastructure   shift to the cloud, spending on security software has felt some   impact from companies that are emphasizing employee training as a   way to avoid the human error that opens the door to many   hackers.Some companies are also pausing to better understand emerging   technologies, before deciding whether to buy. Another issue is   that companies are digesting new technologies acquired the past   few years. Many customers want different layers of security   technologies to share intelligence in order to prevent   attacks.""IT departments don't have unlimited budgets,"" said Ho. The   security budget has been taking away from other areas. Companies   are stepping back, being more strategic, and evaluating   where best to allocate the dollars, not just throwing money at   boxes and software.""Amazon.com is anIBD Leaderboardstock.RELATED:Dividend Leaders Cisco, Toronto Dominion In     Possible BasesCyberArk Security Focus: Mega-Hacks, Privileged     AccessNimble Proofpoint Breaks Out As It Takes Share     From Cisco, SymantecFortinet Upgraded On Profitability"

Is Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Right for Retirement?;10/7/2016;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRetirement planning demands that you find investments that can provide decent growth for the long-term. Often this involves targeting traditional businesses with strong moats that pay dividends. Those criteria haven't always included technology, but holdings likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) stock have made investors rethink the norm.Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Cisco stockis one of those perfect opportunities that presents all those buy-and-hold qualities, but also provides products or services that are on the cutting edge.makeArticleAd();The Growth of CiscoCSCO, which has been around since the mid-1980s, has proven adept at dealing with disruptive changes in technologies - not just through research and development, but also aggressive mergers and acquisitions.From the company's inception, the focus has been on building powerful networks. According toSequoia's Don Valentine, who was an early investor:""By the 1980s, we knew that the first personal computers needed, in some way, to be networked - although that word hadn't been invented yet…That's why I thought the opportunity was so fabulous at Cisco: Their product was able to route that packet at light speed to the right destination. Many people had products that were like a router but were not a router. And switches were common, but switches couldn't do what Cisco's product did.""The networking business definitely turned into a gold mine for Cisco stock during the 1990s, when the Internet revolution took off. And while the bust in 2002-03 saw a falloff, Cisco came back as network-intensive services became more ubiquitous, such as with cloud computing and social networking led by fast-growing companies likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM).But Cisco stock could be poised for even more growth. According to the company's research, the amount of mobile traffic isforecast to surge by 8X from 2015 to 2020, representing a 53% compound annual growth rate. Some of the drivers include mega-trends like streaming video, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the Internet of Things.Cisco is more than just about the network, too. Keep in mind that the company has been fairly smart at leveraging this platform by moving intoadjacent categories, such as collaboration ($4.4 billion in annual revenues), data center ($3.4 billion), wireless ($2.6 billion) and security ($2 billion).Cisco Stock Is a Lesson in ControlCisco is a disciplined organization that keeps costs manageable and is careful with capital allocations. CSCO recently announced a workforce reduction of 5,500 workers, or about 7% of the total. Revenue per employee for Cisco is a hefty $668,000, which isthree times higherthan forHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE) andInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).No surprise, then, that Cisco stock is rock-solid financially.Cash flows from operations in the past year came to$13.6 billion, up about $1 billion from the year before. Cisco also boasts a hefty $65.8 billion in the bank - enough resources to keep up with R&D and M&A, but also to support the generous Cisco dividend, which yields 3.3%.Valuation is reasonable, too. CSCO stock trades at 15 times earnings. By comparison,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is at 27X andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) sports a multiple of 19X.Yes, Cisco's growth metrics have been sluggish, with revenues up just 3% for the past year. But the company has made substantial investments in markets like security and wireless, which should help perk things up. Plus, long-term, CSCO likely will get a lift from growth in the network.All in all, Cisco stock really does have the kinds of factors that make for a core retirement holding: sustainable cash flows, a nice dividend and the potential for a bump on the top line.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and alsoOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools and financial services for   those who have employee stock options (pre- and post-IPO).Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli.

3 Tech Stocks I Never Plan to Buy;10/6/2016;"Many tech investors chase high-growth stocks, but others like   to bottom-fish for contrarian bargains. However, it's important   to recognize the difference between a broken stock and a broken   company -- the former might recover, while the latter might not.   Let's examine three such broken companies which I never plan to   buy.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();InvenSenseInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) makes motion sensors for smartphones, tablets,   smartwatches, and other devices. While those sound like solid   growth markets, the company respectively generated 40% and 16% of   its sales fromApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsunglast year. Peaking sales of both companies' mobile devices are   weighing down InvenSense's revenue, which is expected to decline   24% this year and another 52% next year.To make matters worse, InvenSense faces fierce competition   from larger rivals likeSTMicroelectronics(NYSE: STM) andBosch. Apple installed STMicro's motion sensors instead of   InvenSense's into the Apple Watch last year -- raising concerns   that Apple would eventually use STMicro's motion sensors for its   flagship iOS devices.InvenSense tried to offset that loss by diversifying into   virtual reality headsets and Internet of Things gadgets, but both   rivals are expanding into the same markets.Facebook's Oculus Rift, for example, uses Bosch's motion sensors. This   ongoing competitive pressure could eventually crush InvenSense's   margins. InvenSense was  unprofitable by both non-GAAP and   GAAP measures last quarter, and its losses could keep widening   due to slowing sales and rising competition.FireEyeCybersecurity firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) provides threat detection services which monitor   the perimeters of enterprise networks. This market is a growing   one due to rising data breaches, but it's saturated with many   rivals like next-gen firewall providerPalo Alto Networksand networking equipment giantCisco's bundled security services.Image source: FireEye.That competition caused FireEye's sales to  rise just 19%   annually last quarter, compared to 34% growth in the previous   quarter and 56% growth in the prior year quarter. FireEye expects   sales to rise just 15% to 17% this year, compared to 46% growth   in 2015. The company attributes that slowdown to its shift from   on-site appliances to its new cloud-based platform, FireEye as a   Service (FaaS). Appliances generate revenue immediately, but   subscription-based FaaS revenues are recognized over longer   periods of time.But with sales growth slowing down, FireEye's net losses will   likely widen -- and its hefty stock-based compensation expenses   (35% of its revenues in the first half of 2015) could prove   unsustainable. The company's cash and equivalents also fell from   $402 million at the end of 2015 to $184 million last quarter --   raising the possibility of additional secondary or convertible   debt offerings.To top it off, FireEye's longtime CFO Michael Sheridan   resigned last July amid cash burn concerns, and CEO Dave DeWalt   resigned in June. FireEye's new CEO Kevin Mandia wants to cut   costs to improve profitability -- but that strategy could reduce   its competitiveness and result in even slower sales growth.SeagateSeagate(NASDAQ: STX) has constantly struggled with declining sales of   its core HDDs (hard disk drives), which are being replaced by   smaller, faster, and more power-efficient SSDs (solid state   drives) -- which the company lacks a meaningful presence in. The   ongoing slowdown in PC sales has also exacerbated that   decline.Image source: Pixabay.Seagate's revenue  fell 19% in 2015, and analysts expect   its top line to fall another 5% this year due to weak PC sales   and demand from data centers. Its earnings are  expected to   rise 35% this year, partially recovering from its 84% decline   last year. Those forecasts sound bullish, but they're inflated by   easy year-over-year comparisons and buybacks.Seagate relies heavily on buybacks, spending over $1 billion   on debt-funded buybacks over the past 12 months. To make matters   worse, it's promised to keep paying its forward dividend yield of   6.5% -- which looks unsustainable relative to its earnings payout   ratio of almost 300%. Meanwhile, low interest rates have caused   investors to flock to high-yielding stocks like Seagate, boosting   its trailing P/E to 47 -- a steep premium to the industry average   of 19 for  data storage companies.Seagate also refuses to make a major acquisition, likeWestern Digital's purchase of SanDisk, to remain relevant in the flash storage   and SSD markets. Instead, CEO Steve Luczo convinced activist   investor ValueAct Capital to  take a big stake in the   company and help the company turn around its data storage   business. That bizarre move indicates that Luczo simply doesn't   have a clear plan for Seagate's future.The bottom lineInvenSense, FireEye, and Seagate all still have bullish   supporters, but I'm not buying their turnaround stories.   InvenSense remains at the mercy of larger rivals, FireEye is   shrinking its business when it needs to expand, and Seagate is   treading water with big buybacks and unsustainable dividends.   Therefore, investors should look elsewhere for better contrarian   plays.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

What Rate Of Return Will An Investment In Johnson & Johnson Deliver? Part 2;10/5/2016;"ByChuck Carnevale:IntroductionI never invest in a common stock without a clear expectation of the future returns that it can generate for me. Consequently, I consider this one of the most important steps in my research and due diligence process. Unfortunately, my experience in dealing with investors has led me to conclude that this important step is rarely taken. Most investors possess only a vague idea of what they might earn from investing in a given stock. Many people simply buy a stock hoping that it will go up, and if it pays a dividend, hopeful that the dividend will increase over time.With this article, I'm going to share my specific process on how I estimate the future return that a stock can be expected to offer me. My primary example will be based on a current investment in the blue-chip Dividend Aristocrat Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). Through this exercise, I will offer a methodical approach designed to determine whether Johnson & Johnson is a viable investment choice at today's valuation.makeArticleAd();Johnson & Johnson: Forecasting Future   ReturnsInpart 1of this two-part series, I reviewed Johnson & Johnson, Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) from a historical perspective. Reviewing a company's history and how the market has typically valued the company's operating results is typically the initial step in my due diligence process. However, I consider forecasting the future potential of any company the most crucial step in my due diligence process.Directly stated, I will never invest in a stock until I have made a determination of what rate of return the investment might potentially produce for me. This is essentially done under a most likely case, best-case and worst-case scenarios. I'm not naïve enough to believe that I can make these calculations with absolute precision. Instead, my objective is to determine future return possibilities within reasonable ranges of accuracy and predictability. But most importantly, this gives me more that a vague idea of what the return potential that a company might produce for me. I call this investing with my eyes wide open.However, before I move on to my forecasting process, I would like to briefly review what I saw when I examined Johnson & Johnson's valuation history over different time periods. You can examine my historical approach more comprehensively by reviewing the link to my previous article above.In order to review historical valuations, I rely on theF.A.S.T. Graphsfundamentals analyzer software tool. I always start by looking at all of the company's history available to me. The following long-term earnings and price correlated graph on Johnson & Johnson revealed two important aspects related to valuation. First of all, I noticed that the market applied a premium valuation on Johnson & Johnson's shares from 1997 through the spring of 2007. However, from that point forward, the market was valuing Johnson & Johnson's shares at a lower valuation. I have drawn a line on the graph separating these two time periods. Note that the normal P/E ratio calculation of 20.2 is high because it is skewed by the high valuations over these first 10 years or so.(click to enlarge)When I shortened thetime frame to cover the period 2006 to current, I discovered that the normal P/E ratio that the market has applied over thistime frame has been approximately 15. Importantly, I consider these more recent valuation levels more relevant. Therefore, my fair value assessment for Johnson & Johnson is set at the more conservative P/E ratio of 15 than at the longer-term normal P/E ratio of 20.2. Consequently, with the current blended P/E ratio at 18.1, I would consider Johnson & Johnson moderately overvalued at these levels. As promised, what follows will be the rate of return calculations I believe this valuation level offers.(click to enlarge)When writing articles like this, I can only include a picture of a live, fully-functioning graph. Therefore, I have arranged to have a live, fully-functioning F.A.S.T. Graph available to readers. Next I will offer a few simple calculations utilizing the Forecasting Calculators and their calculating functionality. However, the calculators allow me to run numerous ""what-if"" calculations based on various assumptions. If the reader follows the below link, they will be able to quickly and easily run as many of their own calculations as they desire.Here is thelinkfor a FAST and FUN Preview of F.A.S.T Graphs using the   stock symbol JNJOnce you follow the link, scroll down to the Forecasting Calculators where you will find five calculators that can be utilized to estimate the future return potential on Johnson & Johnson. Each calculator is color-coded and the following screenshot illustrates how to access each calculator. My first calculation will be based on utilizing Johnson & Johnson's normal P/E ratio of 15 (the dark blue tab and border).(click to enlarge)The calculator is presenting forecasts based on the consensus analyst estimates reporting to S&P Capital IQ. With this Johnson & Johnson example, there are 23 analysts forecasting earnings for fiscal year-end December 2016 and 25 analysts forecasting earnings for fiscal year-end 2017. From there, the number of analysts drops off to 17 analysts for fiscal year-end 2018 and only 11 analysts for fiscal year-end 2019. This information is found at the bottom of the graph as ""# Analysts.""Assuming that these analysts are reasonably correct, and the company's stock price was valued at a normal P/E ratio of 15.3 (red circle), then Johnson & Johnson would be expected to deliver a total annualized rate of return of only 3.57% out to December 31, 2019. Personally, I would consider this too low of a rate of return potential which is due to moderately high current valuation. I consider this, as I will elaborate later, my most reasonable case scenario.(click to enlarge)In contrast, if I ran these calculations utilizing the long-term historical normal P/E ratio of 20.1 (red circle), the investment in Johnson & Johnson looks a lot more attractive. Although I would consider this a possibility, my confidence that Johnson & Johnson would trade at that valuation is low. Therefore, I would consider this more of an optimistic or best-case scenario. Nevertheless, the 11.97% total annual rate of return would be considered attractive.(click to enlarge)At this point, I've run these expected and best-case scenarios utilizing the specific consensus analyst estimates over the next few years. However, many investors hold a rather jaundice view of the accuracy of analyst estimates. On some companies, these negative views on analyst estimates are justified, however, there are certain companies where the analysts' track records have been exceptional. Johnson & Johnson happens to be one of those companies that analysts have tended to estimate correctly.The following ""Analyst Scorecard"" summary shows that analysts have been accurate with their forecasts on Johnson & Johnson virtually 100% of the time. This record assumes a 10% margin of error for forecasts made one year in advance, and a 20% margin of error for forecasts made two years in advance.(click to enlarge)This next screenshot provides a more detailed look at the record of analysts making a one year in advance forecast of earnings on Johnson & Johnson. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to assume two things about Johnson & Johnson's estimates. One, Johnson & Johnson must be a relatively easy company to make forecasts on. Two, in my opinion, since analysts rely heavily on company guidance, Johnson & Johnson's management must give good solid guidance. However, the main point I am making with these scorecards is that my confidence level is high regarding the earnings forecasts in the above calculators. Therefore, I feel it is highly likely that they would turn out to be reasonably accurate.(click to enlarge)Once I have run calculations utilizing specific consensus estimates for the next few years, I like to examine the return possibilities utilizing a longer-term three to five-year trend line calculation. The calculator utilized to run these calculations would be found on the third tab on the forecasting calculators' options.(click to enlarge)There are nine analysts (see FAST FACTS box to the right of the graph) offering a three to five-year trend line earnings growth estimate on Johnson & Johnson at 6.07% on average. If those trend line estimates happen to come to pass and Johnson & Johnson traded at a P/E ratio of 15 on December 31, 2001, it would only offer me a 4.8% rate of return. Once again, I would not be too excited about that long-term rate of return possibility notwithstanding Johnson & Johnson's impeccable quality.(click to enlarge)On the other hand, if I utilize that same growth expectation but applied the long-term normal P/E ratio of approximately 21, my rate of return potential would be much more attractive. However, recent historical data suggests that valuation level might be overly-optimistic. Nevertheless, this would be another possible best-case scenario.(click to enlarge)Once I have examined the consensus trend line estimates based on analysts reporting to S&P Capital IQ, I like to check other sources to see what other analysts think. Therefore, I checked the five-year growth forecast on Johnson & Johnson from Morningstar. Here I found a much lower estimate for longer-term growth of only 3.8% on average.""Morningstar Five-Year Growth Forecast""(click to enlarge)Consequently, I then went to the ""Custom"" calculator option and entered a custom trend line growth rate of 3.8% (red circle) according to Morningstar. Once again, utilizing the normal P/E ratio of 15, my rate of return calculation on Johnson & Johnson based on Morningstar estimates only averaged 2.35% per annum. Perhaps this could be considered a worse case - or maybe even just a bad-case scenario for this blue-chip Dividend Aristocrat. Nevertheless, it provides additional insights generated by my due diligence process.(click to enlarge)Additionally, I often like to run rate of return calculations where I utilize historical earnings growth rates in lieu of analyst estimates. This is an approach that Ben Graham suggested. This next calculation utilizes the ""Historical CAGR"" (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5% (red circle) on average for Johnson & Johnson over the past five completed historical years. All things considered, I consider this 5% growth rate achievable for Johnson & Johnson. Consequently, I would consider this a plausible case scenario.(click to enlarge)However, I never stop with just running calculations based on analyst estimates or historical earnings growth rates on any company I am researching. My next step is to check other research providers in order to assess the validity of the assumptions utilized in my calculations. What follows is one example utilizing Morningstar research and its discussion of Johnson & Johnson's economic moat. However, I will check several other research providers for additional information as well.""Morningstar Research: Economic Moat07/19/2016We believe Johnson & Johnson carries one of the widest   moats in the healthcare sector, supported by intellectual   property in the drug group, switching costs in the device   segment, and strong brand power from the consumer group. The   company's diverse revenue base, strong pipeline, and robust cash   flow generation create a very wide economic moat. An extensive   salesforce makes J&J a powerful candidate for a smaller   biotechnology company looking to partner on a new drug, which   strengthens Johnson & Johnson's ability to bring new products   to market.Johnson & Johnson's diverse operations are a major pillar   supporting the wide moat. The company holds a leadership role in   a number of segments, including medical devices, OTC medicines,   and several drug markets. Further, the company is not overly   dependent on one particular operating segment; the pharmaceutical   business, medical device group, and consumer products represent   40%, 40%, and 20% of total sales, respectively. Additionally,   within each segment no one product dominates sales, as Pfizer's   Lipitor did. Despite carrying some lower-margin divisions,   J&J maintains strong pricing power and has posted gross   margins above 68% during the past five years, validating its   strong competitive position.""Finally, after checking numerous research sources, I like to conclude my due diligence by going to the company's website to see what it has have to say about its future. The following excerpts are fromJohnson & Johnson's Second-Quarter 2016Earnings Presentation:(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)One of the areas I am most interested in is the company's earnings guidance. The following slides and the accompanying F.A.S.T. Graphs Forecasting Calculator illustrate that the company guidance and analysts' estimates are aligned. The 2016 earnings forecast of $6.69 is in the middle of the guidance range provided by Johnson & Johnson.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)Johnson & Johnson - Why I'm Not SellingAfter running the above return calculations for Johnson & Johnson going forward utilizing various scenarios, I have concluded that I do not consider Johnson & Johnson a compelling investment at today's valuation. However, I make a distinction between making a buy decision versus a sell decision.The following historical graphs on Johnson & Johnson are marked with a green dot indicating the day that I bought this blue-chip. With the first graph, I have run a calculation of the rate of return I have achieved on my Johnson & Johnson investment thus far. As you can see, this has been a very profitable holding. Because I purchased the stock when it is undervalued, and considering that it is now moderately overvalued, my results have been better than what the company produced on an operating basis.(click to enlarge)With such a nice profit on my investment, it would be very tempting to sell and harvest that return. However, one of my primary reasons for investing in the stock was the company's impeccable history of increasing its dividend every year. Consequently, if I sold, I would be giving up that future dividend. But, as previously suggested, I believe in investing with my eyes wide open.Therefore, I have run a calculation to see what my rate of return would be if the company reverted to the mean by year-end 2017. Obviously, if that happened, it would be lower. On the other hand, I would still be earning a double-digit return. And of course, there is the possibility that Johnson & Johnson's stock price would maintain its current P/E ratio. Once I've established a solid position in a great business like Johnson & Johnson, I am very reluctant to sell unless valuations become extreme. I don't consider Johnson & Johnson's current valuation extreme; therefore, I plan on continuing to hold it for a long time.(click to enlarge)The Bottom LineI hope the reader recognizes that the primary message I'm attempting to deliver with the above exercise is to always invest with your eyes wide open. To me, this means establishing a reasonable expectation of what the business behind the stock is capable of delivering, and then calculating a reasonable rate of return expectation on that basis. In other words, never invest on just a hope or a prayer.Follow-Up Examples From Part 1In part 1 of this two-part series, I covered two additional companies. Therefore, in this part 2, I wanted to give the reader the opportunity to run their own calculations regarding the future return potential of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc. However, I will spare the reader from repeating the exercise as I did with Johnson & Johnson above. Instead, below I have provided links to live, fully-functioning F.A.S.T. Graphs on both of these companies. Additionally, I have provided a few screenshots just to get you started - you choose to take the opportunity to follow the links and run your own calculations.Consolidated Edison, Inc.Here is thelinkfor a FAST and FUN Preview of F.A.S.T Graphs using the   stock symbol ED(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)Cisco Systems, Inc.Here is thelinkfor a FAST and FUN Preview of our F.A.S.T Graphs using   the stock symbol CSCO(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)Summary and ConclusionsAs I stated in part 1 of this two-part series, common stocks come in all sizes and shapes. There are certain companies that might be attractive based on their dividend yields. Other companies might be attractive based on their future growth potential. And, of course, there is everything in between. This simply implies that different types of companies are capable of producing significantly different future rates of return. The primary drivers will be the growth potential of each business, coupled with the valuation you paid to purchase those results.The key to success is to identify the types of companies you are comfortable investing in, and that are capable of meeting your own goals and objectives. However, I believe that no matter how much you like the company, you should always be keenly aware of the valuation you are being asked to pay. One of the best ways to implement and apply a disciplined approach to investing is to run the numbers out to their logical conclusions.With this article, I utilized the ""Forecasting Calculators"" provided by the F.A.S.T. Graphs research tool. However, the same process could be applied utilizing a simple spreadsheet.

Retired? Here Are 2 Stocks You Should Consider Buying;10/5/2016;"If you recently retired, you're probably looking for stocks   with low volatility and high dividends. Low interest rates have   recently inflated the value of manydividend   stockstounattractive levels, but there are two solid income investments which I believe   retirees can still considerbuying --Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andBank of America's Preferred Lshares(NYSE: BAC-L) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();An underappreciated tech stock with a solid     yieldNetworking giant Cisco is only expected to post 1% sales   growth this year and 3% growth next year. That stagnation is   mainly attributed to slowing demand for its routers and switches,   which generated nearly half its revenue last quarter. Router   sales slid 6% annually during the quarter, but switch sales   improved just 2%. Meanwhile, newer cloud-based networking   solutions from companies likeArista Networksthreaten to reduce sales of Cisco's on-site networking   hardware.Cisco's core business might look mediocre, but the company has   been aggressively expanding its higher-growth security, service   provider video, and collaboration services businesses. It also   inked major enterprise partnerships withApple,IBM, andSalesforceto widen its moat against smaller challengers, and made   numerous acquisitions to expand inorganically across the growing   Internet of Things -- which could connect up to  50 billion   devices by 2020.Cisco generates plenty of free cash flow ($12.4 billion over   the past 12 months) for funding acquisitions, buybacks, and   dividends. It respectively spent 22% and 38% on buybacks and   dividends over the past year, indicating that it has plenty of   room to increase both to boost shareholder value. Buybacks are   expected to increase Cisco's earnings by 3% this year and 6% next   year. Cisco hiked its dividend annually for the past five years   and currently pays a forward yield of 3.4% -- which is much   higher than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.1%.Lastly, Cisco trades at just 15 times earnings, which is much   lower than the industry average of 25 for networking and   communication device companies. That low valuation and its solid   yield should set a floor under the stock -- making it a low-risk,   long-term investment for most retirement portfolios.A preferred stock with unusual benefitsBank of America(NYSE: BAC) offers awide varietyofpreferred shareswhich are less volatile and pay higher dividends than its   common shares. Moreover, if Bank of America became insolvent,   preferred shares could be redeemed at a ""par value"" like bonds,   while common shareholders might lose everything. Therefore, the   par value represents a good safety net for retirees, many of whom   likely remember that the global financial crisis wiped out many   major bank stocks.The trade-off is that preferred shares have less upside   potential than common shares, since they become less attractive   as they rise above those par values. Moreover, many preferred   shares can be redeemed, meaning that Bank of America can buy back   those shares at par value at any time past their redemption   dates.The L-series preferred stock is an exception to that rule. The   stock has a par value of $1,000, but can't be redeemed by Bank of   America at any time. However, Bank of America can convert each L   share into 20 common shares, if the common shares rise above   130% of $50 ($65) over 20 of 30 consecutive trading days. That   probably won't happen anytime soon, since Bank of America was   trading for about $15 as of this writing.Therefore, the 130% figure indicates that each L series share   could eventually be converted into $1,300 worth of stock (20   shares of the common stock at $65). So as long as the L series   stock remains below $1,300, as it is now, it trades at a discount   to its long-term value, even though it has an ""uncallable"" par   value of $1,000. Meanwhile, the L series stock pays quarterly   dividends for a 5.9% annual yield --more than triple the common stock's yield.Growth-oriented investors will probably accept the lower   dividend of Bank of America's common shares in exchange for   higher potential price growth. However, I believe that the   L-series preferred shares are better suited for retirees, because   they offer more predictable prices with a much higher yield.The key takeawayCisco and Bank of America's L series stock aren't exciting   investments for growth-oriented investors, but they offer   stability and generous income -- two qualities which will serve   retirees well in their golden years. However, investors should   also do their due diligence and fully understand the benefits and   drawbacks of ETFs, covered calls, and prefered stock before   buying any shares.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something,     but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat:     There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets     and the coming revolution in technology.

Akamai Adds Soha Systems to Cloud Networking Portfolio;10/5/2016;"Akamai Technologies Inc(AKAM) continues to focus on strengthening its Cloud Networking Solutions through acquisitions. The company recently acquired Sunnyvale-based Soha Systems, which provides ""enterprise secure access-as-a-service"" solution. However, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.makeArticleAd();Shares increased 1.7% to close at $54.64 on Oct 4.Per Techcrunch, Soha had raised roughly $10 million from investors that included Andreessen Horowitz, Cervin Ventures, Menlo Ventures and Moment Ventures. Soha's solution helps in improving security compliance while keeping content safe at the cloud (both public and hybrid systems).Per Akamai ""the deal is intended to enhance the firm's strategy in securing, protecting, and accelerating enterprise applications and services through cloud technology."" Soha is an important addition to the cloud networking suite product portfolio that already included technology from previous acquisitions like Bloxx (Oct 2015) and Prolexic (2013).AKAMAI TECH Price and ConsensusAKAMAI TECH Price and Consensus|AKAMAI TECH QuoteGrowing Demand for Security SolutionsWith rapid adoption of cloud computing, security has become a major concern for enterprises. Hackers are using new and sophisticated techniques to take advantage of the security loopholes of the cloud. Large enterprises are expected to increase their security budgets to efficiently address security concerns and instil confidence in cloud computing.We believe that growing demand for Akamai's security solutions will translate into significant growth opportunities going ahead. In the last reported quarter, Performance & security solutions sales increased 16% year over year to $327 million. Of it, $87 million was generated from Akamai's cloud security solutions, which surged 42% year over year.Acquisitions & Partnerships Key CatalystOver the years, acquisitions have been a key catalyst for Akamai. In 2015, the company completed three acquisitions (Xerocole, Codemate A/S and Bloxx) for almost $142.3 million. After a brief lull in the first half of 2016, it recently acquired data processing solution provider Concord Systems. The takeover expands Akamai's presence in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology market.Moreover, Akamai's partnership with the likes of MicrosoftMSFT, CiscoCSCO, AT&T and IBM, will generate financial synergies over the long term.
