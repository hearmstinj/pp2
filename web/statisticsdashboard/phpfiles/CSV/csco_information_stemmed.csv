How Arista Networks Is Succeeding in the Battle for the Data Center,3/24/2017,"If you'v had your head in the sand for the past five years, you might have miss the news that cloud comput is kind of a big deal.IDC saysthat spend on public cloud servic and infrastructur will exceed $122 billion thi year, up nearli 25% from last year. Moreover, IDC estim thi type of growth can continu through 2020. That is seven time faster than the rest of the IT industry!It is safe to say that cloud comput is the domin trend in IT spend today, and thi is whi competit among vendor that suppli these massiv data center is so fierce.Two rival in the data center switch market areCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) andArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) and the latter ha been rack up wins.makeArticleAd();imag source: Getti images.Whi Arista is winningAnalyst have note that Arista' focu on softwar allow it data center client to use cheap ""merchant silicon"" (aka off-the-shelf chips) and compon from low-cost Asian suppliers. Thi allow Arista to make switch use the latest hardwar components, which it can then program with it EO oper system.Given that data center contain vast amount of these switch to connect server and other data centers, the price-perform characterist of software-defin hardwar is a win formula. Cisco ""can't match it,"" Needham analyst Alex Hendersonsaid.And Arista is go for moreArista is also ventur into the rout market. BMO' Tim Long wrote about thi new opportun for Arista' price-disrupt product back in August (viaBarrons): ""Arista can deliv compel TCO [total cost of ownership] advantages, with the compani point to it 100GbE per port price of $3,000 versu $100,000 per port for a tradit router. Ultimately, we believ Arista and the use of merchant silicon will be disrupt to the router market, with optic transport repres a potenti longer-term opportunity.""Whil switch are use to connect servers, computers, and other devices, router are use to connect whole network to the internet or other networks. However, technolog is make the differ between switch and router more blurry, which could allow switch vendor to move into routers, and vice versa. ""Network design is changing. It' get more difficult to distinguish switch from routing,"" Arista CEO Jayshre Ullalsaidrecently. Therefore, it make sens that Arista continu to target Cisco and rout competitorJunip Networks(NYSE: JNPR) .If you can't beat 'em, sue 'emCisco is fight the competit partli in court. Cisco claim Arista infring on it user interfac when design it EO software. Arista, after all, wa found by ex-Cisco employees.In December, a juri side with Arista. While it did find that Arista had infring some Cisco copyrights, it found Cisco did not prove that Arista' design for it command line interfac wa fulli attribut to Cisco' creativity. Thi wa huge win for Arista, which, at least for now, avoid the $335 million in damag Cisco wa seek (not to mention futur licens payments). Cisco is appeal the ruling, so the battl isn't quit over.A new threat to both Cisco and AristaTher is more to the story, however. While Arista is current the disruptor, mani cloud giant such asFacebook,Microsoft,Alphabet, andAmazonar design their own switches.Th extent to which data center custom would design and use their own hardwar is a point of debat among analysts. However, Arista wast no time in responding. On March 7, the compani announc a ""containerized"" version of it EO softwar that would be abl to run on these ""white-box"" hardwar solut from lesser known hardwar companies.Thi make sense. It is better to realiz a potenti threat earli and confront it rather than tri to hold on to the past. Thi could be an even greater problem for Cisco, which still ha the largest market share and biggest brand name. That also mean it ha potenti the most to lose.Th market is on to these trends, however. Cisco trade at 17.5 trail earnings, while Arista trade at a whop 52 time trail earnings. I see further price competit among switch and rout vendor in the month and year ahead, so investor would be smart to watch how thing play out.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These 3 Stocks Just Raised Their Dividends,3/21/2017,"Incom investor are go to miss winter when it end in a few days.Th season wa full of dividend raises, with mani vari compani increas their distributions. More than a few of these stock were big name on the exchanges, and a lot of those rais were substantial. Recent addit to the 2017 roster of lifter includ the follow companies.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Coca-ColaA longtim favorit among incom investors,Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is a dividend aristocrat, one of the small but popular group of stock that have rais their distribut at least onc annual for a minimum of 25 year running. The compani extend it run to a monster 55 year with the latest hike in it quarterli dividend, a 6% lift to $0.37 per share.KO Dividenddata byYChartsOth financi measur for the beverag giant are drop these days, however. In itsfourth quarter, Coke' revenu fell by 6% on a year-over-year basis, while attribut net incom crater by 56%. Much of thi drop is attribut to the company' restructur efforts, which includ the divest of it bottl assets.Anoth concern is that over the past few years, Coke ha spent the bulk of it free cash flow on dividend payments. The compani alway seem to find the mean to keep lift that payout, and as an aristocrat it ha that lofti statu to maintain. So I don't think the streak will end anytim soon. Regardless, I would keep a concern eye on that FCF level.Coke' upcom payout will be dispens on April 3 to stockhold of record as of March 15. At the most recent close stock price, it would yield 3.5%. That' comfort higher than the current 1.9% averag of dividend-pay stock on the S&P 500.CiscoIn contrast to Coke, networking-equip giantCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) hasn't been play the quarterly-dividend game that long -- it onli start to hand out a payment in 2011. Sinc then, though, that payout ha been rais at least onc everi year; the 2017 edit is a healthi 12% lift to $0.29 per share.That' the good news; the not so good is that the compani ha now record five straight quarter of year-over-year revenu declin and is anticip flat growth at best for the current quarter. In it latest report quarter adjust net profit slip by 2% to land at $2.9 billion. Soft in the router and switch segments, two big busi line for Cisco, were larg to blame.Still, the compani remain immens profitable, with mountain of cash flow through it operations. It most recent annual FCF talli grew by almost 10% over the previou year to over $12 billion -- more than enough scratch to take care of both dividend payment and share buybacks. No investor should worri about the futur of thi payout.CSCO Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYChartsCisco' new dividend is to be paid on April 26 to sharehold of record as of April 6. It yield a theoret 3.4% on the current stock price.Barrick GoldTh world' largest miner of everyone' favorit preciou metal, Canada'sBarrick Gold(NYSE: ABX) , is make it sharehold ever so slightli richer.

The compani is make a smart move by marri softwar excel with it hardwar presence, as a bundl solut should help it sell more routers.Th good news is that the Jasper acquisit ha boost Cisco' custom base.

Cisco is well-plac to tap such an opportun as it ha alreadi deploy a comprehens solut for thi market -- LoRaWAN -- that includ two of it industri routers.A it turn out, the deliveri of both hardwar and softwar solut to custom is help Cisco get better. It NGN rout revenu declin ha slow down to 2% in the first half of fiscal 2017, down from the 4% drop seen last year, and investor can expect more gain due to recent order growth.Cisco' strong market share will be the key to tap the opportun in NGN routers, so it is pull the right string in thi busi by augment it hardwar portfolio with softwar offerings.

Why Cisco Is Spending $3.7 Billion on AppDynamics,3/17/2017,"Mani were surpris whenCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) announc in late Januari it decis to buy AppDynamics. Not the acquisit itself -- Cisco' major strategy, after all, involv buy tech start-up and rebrand them under the Cisco parent name. What wa surpris wa the price and time of the purchase.Cisco announc the deal the even befor AppDynam wa set to go public. Public investor interest in the compani may have been disappointed, but Cisco did shell out a big number, buy the compani for $3.7 billion in cash and equiti options. Thi wa more than doubl what the IPO price would have been, as share at the top end of the company' rang would have price the compani at $1.7 billion.Th $3.7 billion seem steep. AppDynam onli gener $158 million in first the nine month of 2016, for an annual run rate revenu of roughli $210 million, which mean Cisco paid roughli 17 time revenu for the company. While AppDynam did sport an impress growth rate of 54% in the first nine month of 2016, that' still a hefti price. Moreover, a previou round of financ for AppDynam had come in at avalu of $1.9 billion, so the IPO could have even been consid a ""down round.""makeArticleAd();So, whi did Cisco pay up? Let' go through some of the possibl rationales.Imag source: Getti Images.What is AppDynamics?AppDynamicsi an enterpris softwar compani that is essenti a diagnost tool for larg IT departments. Mani busi now have a complex assort of applications, databases, on-premis servers, and cloud infrastructure, plu other network compon that form the backbon of their businesses. The interplay between all of these tool can caus bottlenecks, slow performance, or even crashes. Traditionally, IT profession would have to do extens detect work to find troubl spot and get everyth perform at an optimum level.AppDynam make softwar that will detect what is wrong and can vastli cut down the amount of troubleshoot IT team have to do. It also allow real-tim monitor of all of the element in a company' network. That type of insight is veri valuable. For instance, if a company' webpag is not load correctly, that can result in lost sales.AppDynam boast a laundri list of high-profil compani that reli on it services, fromChart Communications(NASDAQ: CHTR) toKraft-Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) . The Motley Fool is also a customer.It appear Cisco didn't want to let thi product and manag team slip through it grasp, so out came the checkbook.AppDynam ha been compar toNew Relic(NYSE: NEWR) and Solarwinds.New Relic ha a market cap around $1.93 billion and the stock trade around eight time revenue. That be said, New Relic' year-over-year revenu growth of 43% in the third quarter is slightli slower than AppDynam at 54%.Solarwind use to be a public company, but wa bought out by privat equiti firm in earli 2016 for $4.5 billion. The buyout repres a 44% premium over the stock' price befor news of the deal surfaced. Solarwind had a somewhat larger suit of products, though, beyond mere applic management.Don't forget attach ratesWhil some peopl may scoff at the premium Cisco is paying, one must alway rememb the concept of attach rate in these type of acquisitions. An attach rate is when a larg compani is abl to cross-sel a secondari product into it exist custom base, therebi give the secondari product a much larger market than it would have had on it own.Whil AppDynam ha an impress list of public and privat clients, it is nowher near the level of penetr that Cisco ha among enterprise, commercial, and servic provid businesses.Tak thi into account, investor should assess the attach rate Cisco can produc for AppDynamics. Sure Cisco is look to add softwar and servic capabl to it suit of enterpris products. The compani is struggl with it legaci hardwar businesses, which are becom more and more commoditized. In response, Cisco is attempt to boost it softwar and servic portfolio via venu includ cybersecurity, performance-enhanc solut such as AppDynamics, or 2016' IOTservic acquisition, Jasper Technologies.Thus, if Cisco can immedi ""attach"" AppDynam to it exist product bundl and spread it quickly, it' possibl Cisco can make a good return. Moreover, AppDynam had been lose money becaus of it high sale and market efforts, so perhap Cisco, in fold the compani into it own sale force, can boost profit as well as growth. We just don't know yet how success Cisco will be in thi regard.To be sure, Cisco investor may have been wari about the price it' pay for AppDynamics. Still, the compani doe appear to have a best-in-class offering, and it' possibl Cisco can acceler the company' growth and margins.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Check Point Software Technologies vs. Palo Alto Networks,3/17/2017,"Imag source: Getti ImagesCybersecur specialistPalo Alto Networks'(NYSE: PANW) stock ha taken a massiv beat in the wake of itsdisappointingfisc second-quart results.

Not surprisingly, Palo Alto' significantli weak outlook for the third quarter threw water over it rally.makeArticleAd();PANWdata byYCharts.Check Point shares, meanwhile, have remain unaffect after Palo Alto' debacle, thank to the company' solidfisc fourth-quarterearnings. But doe thi make Check Point a better buy, or is Palo Alto' drop an opportun in disguise?A closer look at Palo AltoPalo Alto suffer a major setback when it third-quart revenu growth guidanc of 17%-20% fell way behind Wall Street' 31.5% expectation, thank to the execut challeng in it go-to market strategies. The compani ha so far reli on split it busi into more territori each year, and then pour money to acceler sales.Thi strategi indic that Palo Alto is look to buy it way into custom account as it spend over 54% of it revenu on sale and marketing. By comparison, the outlay on research and develop wa way lower at 21% of sales. Thi model of spend aggress on sale and market and keep R&D cost down won't work forev in a competit cybersecur landscape.A it turn out, Palo Alto' marketing-focus playbook hasn't been entir favor as the company' sale and market expens are grow at almost the same rate as it revenue.PANW Revenu (TTM)data byYCharts.It is like that Palo Alto will struggl with a revenu slowdown in the short run as bigger player such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) are make a stronger push into cybersecurity. Cisco' secur revenu grew 14% year-over-year in the fiscal second-quart to $528 million. What' more, Cisco could achiev over $2 billion in revenu from thi busi thi fiscal year at it current run rate, which is well ahead of Palo Alto' project revenu of $1.73 billion.Additionally, Cisco ha step up it game in the cybersecur space by launch an improv firewal product famili last month. Palo Alto, therefore, might find it difficult to compet and to continu to grow it product revenu -- which remain flat in the previou quarter -- and that will impact it subscript business.What about Check Point?Check Point Software' growth isn'ta fashionablea Palo Alto, but there' one major differ between the two of them. While the latter ha been spend a boatload of money on sale and market to acquir revenue, the Isra cybersecur specialist is more margin-focused.PANW Oper Margin (TTM)data byYCharts.Evidently, Check Point ha way better margin compar to Palo Alto as it spent less than 25% of it revenu on sale and market last quarter. What' more, it margin could get even better as the subscript model start gain momentum.Check Point' subscript sale jump 26% last quarter, account for around 23% of it revenu compar to less than 20% in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, it enter into $1 million-plu deal with 99 custom last quarter, up from 86 in the prior-year period. The grow subscript busi should ensur a steadi stream of revenu for the future, while more big ticket deal point toward improv product traction.Th better betPalo Alto is a high-growth, high-risk cybersecur play, so ani weak in it perform will be met with neg reaction on the market. Moreover, the compani is yet to achiev profit (on a GAAP basis) as it ha been spend aggress to enhanc it market share.Analyst expect Palo Alto to becom profit in the next fiscal year -- forecast a forward price to earn ratio of 35 -- though the road is go to be tough. Check Point Software, meanwhile, is profit and is better valu than Palo Alto at 17 time forward earnings.Therefore, investor with a lower risk toler would be more interest in Check Point as it promis stability. Palo Alto' weakness, meanwhile, look like an opportun given the potenti of cybersecur but it will be prudent to wait and watch how it manag the revenu slowdown.10 stock we like better than Palo Alto NetworksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A stretch of stagnant earn growth, meanwhile, put the brake on the double-digit dividend growth that investor have grown accustom to sinc the financi crisis.

Round up the usual suspects--high dividend-yield utilities, REITs, consum stapl and telecom stocks--may not be the best approach. One reason: You'd be ignor some of the biggest dividend-pay sectors, includ technolog and financials.Th higher-yield stock also look expensive, even after their late-2016 sell-off, money manag say. Investor have use them as bond substitut in a low-rat era, and as rate rise, these bond proxi will suffer more than lower dividend-yielders.Stock that can deliv steadi dividend growth, rather than the richest yields, offer the most fertil ground for dividend investors. These hold look cheaper than the high-yielders, they can hold up well in a rising-r environment, and they can offer a buffer against market volatility.Y can maxim the incom you get from these hold by minim fee and taxes. In a dividend-focus mutual fund, a lofti expens ratio can chew through most of your yield.

Dure the 15 worst month for the broader stock market from the end of 1999 through Septemb 2016, the aristocrat lost 5.9%, on average, versu an 8.6% loss for the high-yield and an 8.9% averag declin for the S&P 1500.Thearistocrat tend to be more resilientdur the worst market downturn in part becaus rais dividend year after year reflect a certain level of financi health and discipline, S&P notes.So where can you find depend dividend grower at a decent price? For old-school dividend investor rais on Ma Bell and Coca-Cola, the answer may be a bit surprising.On sector that' highli favor by value-mind dividend fund manag these days: technology. In 2016, the sector surpass financi to becom the biggest contributor to S&P 500 dividends, account for 15.5% of payouts.SE ALSO:25 Dividend Stock You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMatur tech companies, such as Microsoft (symbolMSFT; recent price, $64), Cisco System (CSCO, $32) and Qualcomm (QCOM, $54), gener load of free cash flow and are find fewer opportun to re-invest in their businesses, say Mike Liss, co-manag of theAmerican Centuri Valu fund. That leav them with an ""abil to increas their dividend at a rate better than the averag stock,"" Liss says.Microsoft, which yield 2.3%, ha nearli doubl it quarterli dividend in the past five years, to 39 cent a share. Money manag see more healthi dividend growth ahead as the company' leadership in cloud comput improv it earnings-growth prospects.Cisco, which yield 3.3%, is known for make the switch and router that move data around comput networks. But Cisco is also expand into faster-grow area such as collabor and security. The compani ha boost it dividend everi year sinc initi it payout in 2011.Patient investor should also take a look at Qualcomm, which yield 3.8%, say John Buckingham, chief invest offic atAFAM Capitaland manag of theAl Frank fund. The stock ha been crush thi year, in part becaus Appl is su Qualcomm over it busi practices, and it now trade at just 11 time analysts' estim of earn in the come year. Buckingham believ the litig will ultim be settl and ""the magnitud of the declin ha creat opportun for those who can take a long-term view.""Look for Healthi PayoutsHealth care stock have look rather sickli lately. Concern about repeal of the Afford Care Act, as well as talk from Washington about negoti lower drug prices, have weigh on the sector.But the polit nois ha creat an opportun for long-term dividend investors, particularli in drug stocks. ""If you continu to creat drug that are innov and meet unmet needs, you'r go to get premium price for those products,"" Liss says.Hold in Liss' fund includ drug giant Pfizer (PFE, $32) and Merck (MRK, $64). Pfizer yield 3.8% and trade at just 13 time analysts' estim of it full-year earnings. While the loss of patent protect on sever drug is a headwind, the compani maintain an impress portfolio of patent-protect drug and is launch sever potenti best-sel in cancer, immunolog and other areas.Lik Pfizer, Merck ha a strong pipelin of new drug to balanc out upcom patent losses. Cancer drug Keytruda ha been a notabl success as the compani sharpen it focu on unmet medic needs. Merck yield 2.9% and ha rais it dividend six year in a row.Swiss drug giant Roch Hold (RHHBY, $30) and Novarti (NVS, $75) also look like good values, say Matt Burdett, associ portfolio manag atThornburg Invest Management. Pricey biologics, which tend to have less gener competition, account for a larg portion of Roche' drug sales, and Roch also ha a strong diagnost business. The stock yield 3.4%.Novartis, which yield 3.6%, is well diversifi with pharmaceuticals, eye care and other businesses. The compani is launch sever drug in key area such as cancer and heart failure.Guard Against Rise RatesRis rate gener aren't disastr for dividend stocks. Look at the two-, three- and five-year period follow the initi of Feder Reserv rate-hik cycl date back to 1954, dividend payer have outperform non-dividend payers, accord to AFAM Capital.But when interest rate rise, some dividend payer do suffer. In recent research, Morningstar look at rising-r period from May 1953 through the end of 2016. The 30% of stock with the highest yield lost about 1.5%, on average, while the 30% with the lowest yield gain 3.2%.SEE ALSO:8 Dow Dividend Stock You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMani dividend-focus fund manag are favor a sector that stand to benefit from rise rates: financials. As rate rise, bank may see an improv in their net interest margins--a measur of lend profitability. What' more, bank are like to see looser capit requir and other deregul under the new administration, say Sandi Pomeroy, co-manag of theNeuberg Berman Equiti Incom fund. With capit freed up, bank may have more flexibl to boost their dividends.Mani big bank stock saw sharp run-up after the election. One that still look attract valu is Bank of America (BAC, $23), say Matt Quinlan, co-manag of theFranklin Incom fund. At 1.1%, it doesn't have the richest yield, but it trade for less than book value. The bank ha slowli recov from it ill-advis 2008 acquisit of mortgag lender Countrywid Financi and ha sharpli cut cost in recent years.Ris rate are also ""a posit for insur compani who have substanti dollar in fix income,"" Buckingham says. He like MetLif (MET, $53), which yield 3% and trade at just 10 time analysts' estim of it full-year earnings. The compani is spin off a U.S. retail unit, a move that analyst see as help MetLif gener more stabl cash flow.Focu on FundsIf you'r shop for a dividend-focus mutual fund, keep a close eye on fees. A mutual fund' expens ratio eat into it yield. So ""the relationship between expens ratio and incom is quit direct,"" Benz says.On high-quality, low-cost fund is Vanguard Dividend Appreci (VIG), an exchange-trad fund that yield 2.1% and charg just 0.09% annually. It track the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achiev Select Index, which includ compani that have boost dividend for at least 10 consecut years.Anoth low-cost option: Schwab U.S. Dividend Equiti ETF (SCHD). The fund track the Dow Jone U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includ compani that not onli have paid dividend for 10 year in a row but also have strong cash-flow-to-debt ratios, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. The fund yield 2.9% and charg just 0.07% annually.Investor look to avoid the highest yielder might also consid iShar Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO). It track the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index, which exclud stock with yield in the top 10% of the broader stock universe. The fund charg 0.08% annual and yield 2.3%.Whether you'r choos a dividend-focus fund or pick your own stocks, pay attent to the potenti tax hit. Qualifi dividends, which includ most U.S. stock dividends, get favor tax treatment. Taxpay in the 25% to 35% tax bracket pay 15% on qualifi dividends. Taxpay in the 10% and 15% bracket pay zero; those abov the 35% bracket pay 20%. If your adjust gross incom is more than $200,000 for singl or $250,000 for marri couples, you'll owe an addit 3.8% on your net invest income, includ qualifi dividends.But mani hold favor by dividend investor don't pay qualifi dividends. Payout from REITs, some foreign stock and convert can be tax as ordinari income. With master limit partnerships, a larg chunk of distribut is typic tax-deferred, but investor may pay a combin of capital-gain and ordinary-incom tax rate when they sell their units.""It' worth look under the hood"" of dividend-focus fund becaus mani of these fund hold non-qualifi dividend payers, Benz says. She point toAmerican Centuri Equiti Income, which is a high-qual fund but tend to hold some non-qualifi dividend payer such as convertibles. The fund' 10-year tax-cost ratio is 1.8, accord to Morningstar, mean that investor have lost an averag annual 1.8% of asset to taxes. Investor inVanguard Dividend Appreci Index fund, which hold onli common stocks, have sacrif far less to taxes, lose an averag annual 0.73% over the period.Anoth tax question for dividend investor is whether to hold foreign dividend-pay stocks--or fund that invest in those stocks--in an IRA. Mani countri withhold tax from dividend that their compani pay to oversea investors. U.S. investor are tax a second time on those dividends, either when they report dividend incom for their taxabl account or withdraw money from their IRA. You can claim a foreign tax credit on your feder return for the tax withheld by the foreign country--but onli if you hold the stock in a taxabl account. If you hold the invest in an IRA, there' no way to recoup the foreign tax paid.""If you have an IRA and a taxabl account, put the foreign stock or foreign stock fund into the taxabl account,"" say John Burke, a financi advis atBurk Financi Strategies, in Iselin, N.J. But there' a caveat: Compani in countri that don't have a tax treati with the U.S. may pay non-qualifi dividends, make them a poor fit for a taxabl account. Most countri have a tax treati with the U.S., but there are signific except such as Brazil, Chile and Singapore.TAK OUR QUIZ:Test Your Invest IQ"
Cisco Is Now an Even Better Dividend Stock,3/7/2017,"While network hardwar giantCisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) fiscal second-quart report wa a bit of a mix bag, it contain one great piec of news for investors. Cisco announc that it wa rais it quarterli dividend to $0.29 per share, up 11.5% from the previou payment of $0.26 per share. With the stock now yield 3.4%, an alreadi great dividend stock ha gotten even better.Cisco onli began pay a dividend in 2011 after it becam clear that it day as a rapidli grow compani were over. The initi quarterli dividend wa just $0.06 per share. Cisco ha rais it dividend at least onc a year sinc then, almost quintupl it in just six years.Data source: Cisco. Chart by author.makeArticleAd();Among the technolog giants, Cisco ha one of the highest dividend yields. A stronger focu on share buyback over dividend at mani of Cisco' peer is one reason for Cisco' higher yield. Cisco ha spent billion over the past few year buy back it own shares, but the company' capit return polici is more balanc than most.CompanyForward Dividend YieldCisco3.40%Microsoft2.43%Apple1.64%Intel2.92%IBM3.10%Data source: Morningstar.Cisco spent $4.75 billion on dividend in fiscal 2016 and $3.91 billion on share buybacks. Appl sent sharehold $12.15 billion in dividend while plow $29.72 billion into share buybacks. Microsoft paid $11.0 billion in dividend and spent nearli $16 billion on share buybacks. Share buyback can be a big win for investor if the price paid is favorable, but I gener prefer Cisco' dividend-heavi approach.Wil the dividend keep growing?Cisco gener $12.4 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2016, put the payout ratio base on free cash flow, the new $0.29-per-shar payment and the most recent share count at about 47%. Thi give Cisco some room to grow the dividend over the next few year even if earn growth doesn't resume. Share buybacks, which reduc the share count and thu the total dividend payment, will also help the cause.Th company' earn growth ha hit a wall in recent quarters, creat a situat where the dividend is grow far faster than earnings. Thi will eventu becom a problem as the payout ratio grows, and if Cisco can't return to consist earn growth eventually, middl dividend growth will be the like result.It long-term growth plan involv shift it busi more heavili toward softwar and services, particularli subscriptions. Switch and rout hardwar will remain the core of the company, but those busi have been inconsist and are like unabl to drive meaning growth.Imag source: Cisco.Cisco' defer revenu relat to subscript softwar and servicesreach $4 billionat the end of the second quarter, up 51% year over year. Thi is spread across Cisco' entir business, but faster-grow segment like collaboration, security, and wireless make up the majority. The move to subscript is hurt Cisco' result in the near term, as revenu recognit is push into the future, but the subscript busi should eventu becom big enough to start drive growth for the compani as a whole. At least, that' the plan.Acquisit are a big part of Cisco' growth strategy, and heavi spend on acquir compani may put a lid on dividend growth over the next few years. Cisco recent agre to pay a whopping$3.7 billion for AppDynamics, a softwar compani that wa on pace to gener about $230 million of revenu in 2016. More acquisit are a near certainti as Cisco look to further build out it softwar portfolio.On wild card when it come to dividend growth is the possibl of corpor tax reform and a tax repatri holiday. A lower tax rate and the abil to bring billion of dollar in oversea cash back to the U.S. inexpens would free up a lot of cash for acquisitions, buybacks, and perhap a higher dividend. Cisco' balanc sheet featur around $36 billion of cash net of debt, which could fuel dividend growth even if earn growth remain sluggish.With anoth double-digit dividend increase, Cisco ha made it stock even more entic to dividend investors. Dividend growth may slow down go forward, but with a 3.4% yield, Cisco is one of the best techdividend stocksaround.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $32 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of 56 cents. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 1.8% return against the $32 commitment, or a 6.3% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to CSCO' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco System Inc see it share declin 6.3% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $31.44 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the 56 cent from $32), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 6.3% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annual 6.3% figur actual exce the 3.4% annual dividend paid by Cisco System Inc by 2.9%, base on the current share price of $34.15.

Accord to recent releas data for fourth-quart 2016 by two independ research firm - Gartner Inc.ITand Intern Data Corpor (""IDC"") - global server market revenu wit a year-over-year decline.Notably, thi wa the fourth consecut quarter of declin for the industry. Prior to that, it had wit seven straight quarter of year-over-year growth.What the Report SaysAccord to preliminari data releas by Gartner, worldwid server revenu decreas 1.9% year over year to $14.838 billion in the fourth quarter while overal shipment inch down 0.6% to 2.939 million. For full-year 2016, server revenu declin 2.7% despit a 0.1% increas in shipments.IDC' view were also more or less similar to Gartner. IDC report a 4.6% declin in server revenu with fourth-quart revenu come in at $14.613 billion. Shipment increas 3.5% to 2.55 million units.Th reason highlight by the two research firm for thi dismal perform were also more or less similar. Accord to IDC, sluggish invest in hyperscal data center, declin high-end server sale and tough year-over-year comparison due to the end of the robust enterpris refresh cycl were the main reason behind the dismal performance.Jeffrey Hewitt, research vice presid at Gartner highlight some distinct aspect of 2016. He reveal that ""Enterpris grew at a lower rate as they continu to leverag server applic through virtual and in some cases, servic provid in the cloud."" However, he ad that ""Hyperscal data center (e.g., Facebook, Google) grew and, at the same time, drove some signific server replacements.""With respect to individu server manufacturers, both the firm have a similar view on the top three vendors. With respect to revenues, accord to Gartner and IDC, Hewlett Packard EnterpriseHPEretain it lead position, follow by Dell and Intern Busi MachinesIBM.Th research firm had differ view when it came to the fourth and fifth positions. As per Gartner, Huawei and Lenovo were at the fourth and fifth position, respectively. On the other hand, accord to IDC, the fourth place wa a tie between Lenovo and CiscoCSCO. Furthermore, IDC did not mention the vendor' name occupi the fifth position, Instead, for the first time, it provid revenu and shipment data for ODM Direct group of vendors.A per Gartner, it wa Dell and Huawei that regist year-over-year growth in revenu as well as shipments. Dell wit an increas of 1.8% and 6.5% in revenu and shipments, respectively, while Huawei wit 88.4% rise in revenu and 64% growth in shipments.Moreover, accord to Gartner, in term of the number of unit shipped, Dell move to the number one spot with a market share of 19.1%, push Hewlett Packard Enterpris to the second spot with 17.2% share.Region-wise, Gartner reveal that except for the Asia-Pacific, everi other region wit a fall in either revenu or shipment. IDC also agre to thi and said that Asia/Pacif (exclud Japan) (APeJ) and Japan were the onli regions, which regist year-over-year growth in revenues. Per IDC, server revenu in APeJ and Japan grew 8.1% and 3.3%, respectively.Com to x86 servers, the two research firm had differ opinions. Per Gartner, x86 server revenu increas 1.1% year over year mainli driven by demand from large-scal data center build-out and growth in integr systems.On the other hand, per IDC, revenu of x86 server declin 1.9% year over year to $12.2 billion while shipment drop 3.3% to 2.53 million units. Despit a fall of 13% in x86 server revenues, Hewlett Packard Enterpris retain it lead posit while Dell remain at the second spot.Bottom LineAlthough there are differ in the two research firms' figures, they hint that 2017 will be a tough year as well for server vendors. Gartner predict modest growth thi year, primarili driven by servic provid build-outs, which will be partial offset by a declin in unit purchas by enterprises.Kuba Stolarski, research director, Comput Platform at IDC, ha a somewhat similar view. Accord to him ""Some public cloud datacent deploy are be delay and there are indic that overal level of deploy and refresh may slow down even through the long term as hyperscal continu to evalu their hardwar provis criteria.""H further ad ""On the enterpris side, we are see ongo weak as compani struggl to decid whether to deploy workload on premis or off, and continu to consolid exist workload on fewer servers.""Although there is huge growth opportun in the hyperscal server infrastructur space with more and more compani shift to cloud-bas storage, we believ that the sluggish tech spend environ could continu to hurt the overal server market in the near term.Look at the two firms' cautiou outlook for server shipments, we believ that the overal perform of vendor will remain weak in the next few quarters. Therefore, it is advis that investor stay away from invest in thi space.Currently, Intern Busi Machin and Cisco carri a Zack Rank #3 (Hold), while Hewlett Packard Enterpris ha a Zack Rank #4 (Sell).You can seeth complet list of today' Zack #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock here.Zacks' Top 10 Stock for 2017In addit to the stock discuss above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold ticker for the entireti of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Non-GAAP net incom stay flat year over year at $2.9 billion, or $0.57 per share, which still beat estim by a penny.A a Cisco shareholder, I wa glad to see the stock climb. But it also made me wonder -- did Cisco deserv to rise to pre-dot com bust levels? Or wa Cisco' ralli mere fuel by demand for depend dividend play with low valuat in a low interest rate market? Let' take at a closer look at Cisco' earn report to find out.Imag source: Cisco.makeArticleAd();First, the good news...Cisco' Secur busi ha been it fastest-grow unit over the past few quarters. Revenu at the busi rose 14% annual to $528 million, and defer revenu -- a key indic of futur demand -- surg 45%. Cisco attribut that growth to robust demand for it advanc threat solut products, next-gen firewall, and secur internet gateway.Cisco' collabor revenu also rose 4% to $1.06 billion, and defer revenu grew 14%. That growth wa attribut to WebEx and Spark, the cloud-bas enterpris collabor platform it launch in late 2015. However, Spark current face tough competit in the collabor space fromriv platforms.Cisco' Spark. Imag source: Cisco.Cisco' wireless revenu rose 3% to $632 million, fuel by the ongo expans of wireless infrastructur to satisfi data hungri customers, strong sale of it 11ac Wave 2 (a new Wi-Fi standard) portfolio of products, and grow demand for it Meraki cloud-bas services.Cisco' total defer revenu rose 13% annual to $17.1 billion, thank to higher demand for subscription-bas and softwar offerings. That growth will gradual allow Cisco to pivot away from it slower-growth hardwar businesses. Cisco also hike it dividend by three cent to $0.29 per share, give it a forward yield of 3.4% and mark it sixth consecut dividend hike. Lastly, Cisco gener $12.3 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 month -- which give it plenti of capit to buy up addit compani inhigher-growth marketslik security, analytics, and the Internet of Things.Now, the bad news...Th big problem for Cisco is that it security, collaboration, and wireless busi onli gener less than a fifth of it total revenue. Nearli half of Cisco' revenu still come from it switch and router units, which are both experienc sluggish growth due to market satur and commoditization.Cisco' switch revenu fell 5% annual to $3.31 billion dure the quarter, due to weaker demand from campu customers, which wa partli offset by rise demand for it ACI (application-centr infrastructure) products. Rout revenu fell 10% to $1.82 billion, as growth in order fail to offset price pressure.Thos declin indic that cloud-bas SDN (software-defin networking) rival likeArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) -- which Cisco is tri to tackl with lawsuit -- are caus a disrupt paradigm shift across the market. Cloud-bas network solut are more scalabl and requir less on-sit hardwar like router and switches, which could turn Cisco' busi upsid down. Arista ha even claim that combin it Jericho switch with it FlexRout softwar can completelyreplacerout with cheaper SDN solutions.Cisco' data center revenu also fell 7% to $790 million due to the ""blade to rack"" shift in which enterpris consum are favor smaller, cheaper, and more scalabl rack server over pricier, higher-pow blade servers.Lastly, Cisco' guidanc wa mediocr at best. For the current quarter, it expect -2% to break-even revenu growth with non-GAAP earn of $0.57-$0.59, which would be nearli flat from prior year levels. Analyst expect it revenu to fall 2% and earn to grow 1% for the full year.But it' all about the valuations...Bas on those numbers, it seem odd that Cisco is hover near a 16-year high. However, Cisco' P/E of 18 is actual much lower than it industri averag of 25 and the S&P 500' P/E of 25. Moreover, the last time Cisco' P/E wa at 18 (in earli 2015), it trade in the upper $20 -- indic the stock isn't as expens as it long-term price chart make it look.When we combin that low valuat with Cisco' recent dividend hike, the stock ha a good balanc between a low valuat and a high yield -- which ha becom increasingli rare in today' frothi market. Therefore, investor shouldn't be thrill by Cisco' lacklust top and bottom line growth, but they should realiz that it' still a cheap and depend incom play.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Cisco Systems Inc. vs. Oracle Corp.,3/1/2017,"BothCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andOracle(NYSE: ORCL) have been under scrutini from investor as they navig through signific busi transitions. For Cisco, the ongo transform mean less relianc on it legaci router and switch business, and a greater focu on cloud-bas secur solutions, enterpris communications, and the Internet of Thing (IoT).Though it took Oracl co-found and current CTO Larri Ellison a while to get aboard the cloud bandwagon, hi compani ha final done so, and that' begin to pay signific dividends. Last quarter mark the first time Oracle' cloud sale top the magic $1 billion plateau. However, Oracle' cloud result come with a caveat.So of these two veteran tech major look to capit on the next wave of change, which is the better buy?makeArticleAd();Oracl headquart Imag source: OracleTh case for OracleBas on it year-over-year results, Oracle' second quarter wa close to a home run. Each of it key cloud unit -- software-as-a-servic (SaaS), platform-as-a-servic (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-servic (IaaS) -- perform admirably.Th hands-down leader in term of revenu growth were Oracle' Saa and Paa units, which togeth climb a whop 81% to $878 million. Yes, that' a mere fraction of Oracle' total sale -- which were flat year-over-year at $9 billion -- but it' a fraction that' grow larger with each pass quarter.Th aforement $1 billion-plu in cloud sale includ the $175 million in Iaa revenu Oracl gener last quarter, good for a meager 6% improv -- which repres a tremend opportunity. Combin with infrastructur software, Iaa and relat softwar gener an estim $471 billion last year with the major -- $294 billion -- from Iaa alone.Which beg the question: Whi is Oracl seemingli put such a signific opportun on the back burner? The upsid potenti in it cloud softwar busi is also significant, but at these rel earli stages, Oracl shouldn't leav anyth cloud-rel unexploited.Al the posit cloud news ha been good for Oracl stock, push it share price up 10% in 2017, but there' a caveat. Oracle' late arriv to the cloud translat to aw tame comparables, so investor would be wise to take that into account befor over-celebrating.Cisco IoT. Imag source: CiscoTh case for CiscoThough the cloud and relat solut are also on Cisco' radar, it' the focu on IoT and the fast-grow data secur market that will drive thi company' long-term growth. The good news is that Cisco is make inroad in both key areas, which it demonstr yet again the past coupl of days.Connect car are one avenu of IoT growth, and Cisco is among a host of provid go all in to win market share as supplier to the auto industry. It recent deal withHondato power it new connect car platform is the latest in a string of win for Cisco in a market expect to grow to more than $46 billion in three years. So Cisco is move the needl with it effort in two of the fastest grow area of IoT -- the other be smart cities. Better still, it work to domin data secur could give it a posit that surpass even it IoT ambitions.A with Oracle' cloud results, Cisco' strong data secur growth should be view in context. Through the first two quarter of Cisco' fiscal 2017, secur sale have climb 13% to $1.07 billion. That' a small fraction of Cisco' $23.9 billion in total revenue, but therein lie the opportunity. One report suggest data secur spend will reach $1 trillion between now and 2021, and Cisco is lead the charge.Cisco expect there will be 26.3 billion connect devic global in 2020, which is whi it new ""secur architectur for mobil servic providers"" solut is such a time addit to it offerings. Target telecom with data secur solut in an increasingli mobile, digit world is a no-brain for it. And Cisco' new mobil secur platform ha alreadi gain a number of fan among some of the lead telecom on the planet.Th envelop pleaseSo which is the better buy, Oracl or Cisco? Both are sound, long-term plays, but given Cisco' 3.4% dividend yield -- Oracle' is 1.4% -- and it earli leadership posit in IoT and data security, each of which could dwarf the opportun in the highli competit cloud market, over the long haul, Cisco get the nod.10 stock we like better than OracleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That' an overwhelm number that can make it difficult for a new investor to get started.To help you narrow down your selection, we ask a team of Fool to each pick a stock they think is a great choic for a beginner. They chooseWast Management(NYSE: WM) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,American Express(NYSE: AXP) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andCostco(NASDAQ: COST) . Read on to find out why.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th benefit of buy disruption-proof businessesTyl Crowe(Wast Management):On of the thing begin investor should learn when make their first dividend invest is how to identifi compani in essenti function of our everyday live with nearli insurmount competit advantag over their competition. These are the kind of compani that will have the price power to grow revenu and profit for decad to come, and return consider valu to shareholders.On compani that fit thi mold incred well is refus handler Wast Management. The compani is the largest refus collect company, and it ha a larg network of landfills, dispos centers, and recycl facil across the U.S. The waste-handl busi inher ha lot of competit advantag for it well-establish players. It' extrem capital-intens to build out a fleet of wast collect vehicles, there are lot of regulatori hurdl involv in open new landfil and maintain exist ones, and it' extrem difficult to disrupt how human gener and handl waste. These thing combin to give Wast Manag a veri favor oper environ where it can pass along rise cost to custom pretti easili and gener a steadi stream of profits.For years, Wast Manag ha taken these competit advantag and turn them into a veri shareholder-friendli business. For more than a decade, the compani ha steadili rais it dividend payment and bought back share to gener high rate of return in what mani would consid a slow-growth business.WM Return on Equiti (TTM)data byYCharts.For begin investors, compani with huge competit advantag like Wast Manag are a great lesson in whi it pay to hang onto stock for the long term. The company' share price gain will never blow anyone' sock off, but it high rate of return in an industri that will like be around for decad will reward those who hold onto their position.Th transit is workingBrian Feroldi(Microsoft):I'm a firm believ that new dividend investor should seek out big, highli profit compani for their first investment. That criteria perfectli describ Microsoft, which is whi I think it' a fantast stock for beginners.Microsoft ha been crank out profit for decad thank to it stranglehold on the softwar industry. Product such as Window and Offic are cash cow that have been a depend sourc of revenu for decades. That should hold true for a long time to come.However, Microsoft' stock stagnat for year over worri that the ever-chang tech world would render thi company' product obsolete. Thankfully, that worri got put to rest when Satya Nadella took over the top chair in 2014. CEO Nadella ha place an emphasi on move Microsoft' product into the cloud, a decis that' pay off handsom as revenu from product like Azure, Offic 365, and Dynam CRM Onlin are surging. When you add in the growth of other product line such as Xbox, Bing, and Surface, Microsoft' bottom line ha been post healthi gain in recent years.Look ahead, market watcher believ Microsoft' bottom line will grow by more than 9% annual over the next five years. That seem realist when combin the growth in cloud product sale with it recent complet acquisit of LinkedIn. Add to that the company' rock-solid dividend yield of 2.4%, and I can't help but think Microsoft is a terrif stock for new dividend investor to buy.Buy one of Buffett' favorit at a great valueJasonHall(American Express):Warren Buffett first bought share of American Express when the company' stock wa sell for bargain prices. Decad later, those share are worth almost 10 time whatBerkshir Hathawaypaid -- but that' onli the tip of the iceberg of what American Express mean for Buffett and Berkshir today.At the current $0.32 per share quarterli dividend, American Express will pay Berkshir almost $195 million in dividend in 2017. That may seem like a paltri yield on it $12 billion stake, but when we look at the yield on cost -- that is, how much American Express' dividend pay base on the origin invest -- the math is much better: Berkshir get paid a roughli 15% yield on it cost for those AmEx shares. And with it prospect and track record, that payout is like to keep grow for year to come.There' a wonder lesson for begin investors: Don't skip the small-yield stock if you'r look for dividends. Sometim your best choic is one like American Express, which ha spent far more time yield below 2% of it market price than abov 3%, but it ha steadili and regularli rais it dividend for decades:AXP Dividenddata byYCharts.Don't let today' paltri yield caus you to miss an excel dividend growth stock. American Express stock is cheap today, trade near 14 time last year' earnings. And with it track record of dividend growth, it could be pay you 15% or more on your origin invest in a coupl of decades.Th compani at the core of our digit worldChuck Saletta(Cisco Systems):Cisco is the ubiquit network giant respons for mani of the high-spe router and switch that move financi transactions, videos, pictures, and text all over the internet. It' also establish itself as a strong dividend player with both a decent histori of increas it dividend and reason room to continu rais it go forward. That combin set it up as a great potenti invest for someon just now dip into the realm of dividend investing.Cisco paid it first dividend of $0.06 per share per quarter in 2011, and it ha been increas it sinc then. The company' current yield is almost 3.5%, which is a decent premium over the gener market. It recent rais it dividend from $0.26 per share per quarter to $0.29, an increas of 11.5%. Even with that increase, Cisco pay out onli around half of it earn in the form of dividends, which give it room to continu increas those dividend as it busi grow over time.Speak of that growth, over the next five years, analyst expect Cisco to be abl to increas it earn by almost 11% per year. If it doe manag to grow at that pace, and it dividend follow suit, investor will receiv around $0.48 per share per quarter five year from now. That' the true power of a strong dividend invest strategy.Learn from a greatJordan Wathen(Costco):Warehous retail Costco is neither cheap nor especi high-yielding, but it is the kind of compani I'd recommend to a friend as a compani to follow and learn from.Costco ha more trait of the ""greats"" than perhap ani other company. For one, it ha the advantag of effici scale, which result from the fact it gener about $120 billion in revenu from just 4,000 products, thu frequent make Costco it suppliers' single-largest customer. That give it power at the negoti table.It' also ridicul good at manag it balanc sheet. Costco manag to sell it inventori befor the bill even come due.Oh -- and it somehow creat a cult follow thatForbesonc dub ""Costcoholics"" for the fact that it loyalist visit the store sever time a week to see what' new. Not mani retail have rabid fan of their off-label brands, but Costco does.Let' get back to the dividend. Costco' current yield of 1% underst it heft as a dividend stock. I think it' like that dividend will grow at a double-digit clip for year to come, as it earn power increas and it pay out a greater percentag of earn to it shareholders. What' more important, especi for beginn investors, is the opportun to use the compani as a case studi to learn about what separ the good busi from the great businesses.10 stock we like better than Costco WholesaleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That mark the fifth straight quarter that the compani ha post fall revenue.Sadly, thing appear set to remain that way for at least the next few quarters. After all, Cisco guid to revenu growth of -2% to breakeven for the current quarter, and see non-GAAP per-shar earn come in at 57 cent 59 cents, in line with Wall Street' consensu of 58 cents.Oddli enough, Cisco stock ha tuck on gain of 6% sinc the earn call, revers the selloff that happen immedi after the results. Cisco stock is now up a solid 13.3% year-to-date. So why, pray, are investor celebr Cisco' revenu tailspin?Busi Model Transit for Cisco StockCSCO is stuck in the throe of a seriou busi model transition. Sinc it earli days, the compani ha been in the busi of sell switch and router that move data around the internet. That' still true in a big way sinc the compani still deriv more than 40% of it revenu from thi network business.But with more and more compani reli on rent comput servic from the like ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), they are buy less and less of Cisco' hardwar for their data centers.Even wors is the fact that when they do buy, they are upgrad to newer devic less often. Further, Cisco is increasingli face tougher competit and cheaper offer from the like ofArista Network Inc(NYSE:ANET), a compani that wa found by former top Cisco executives.Throw in the fact that more compani are experi with software-defin network (SDN), and Cisco is find itself caught between a rock and hard place. Last quarter' result say it all: Cisco' switch and rout revenu for the quarter fell 5% and 10% to $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.But CSCO has, over the past few years, been work on a grand plan that involv push for a recur subscription-bas revenu model. Thi essenti mean develop busi that will protect it from the vagari of the boom-and-bust cycl of it core business.Chief execut Chuck Robbin is optimist that Cisco can leverag the lesson glean from it subscription-bas businesses, such as Meraki cloud-control WiFi, Secur softwar and Collabor to build a solid subscript revenu businesses. Cisco' Secur segment wa the brightest spot in the earn report after grow 14% to reach $528 million. Meanwhil the Collabor busi grew 4% to hit $1,062 million.Investor were pleas with Cisco' latest report is becaus it show that the compani is make progress discov new recur revenu streams. The compani announc that product defer revenu relat to softwar and subscript grew 51% to reach $4 billion. Meanwhile, 10% of it $9 billion Product sale is now of a recur nature, up from virtual zero a coupl of year ago.Cash Cow and Dividend MachineFor all it troubles, Cisco remain by far the most domin player in the network business, someth that ha help the compani preserv it fat margins. Dure the last quarter, the company' Product gross margin decreas from 63.4% to 61.1%, but it Servic gross margin increas from 65.1% to 67.7%. Improv margin is a good sign that the company' price power remain undiminished.Healthi margin have allow CSCO stock to becom a cash cow, with annual free cash flow approach $13 billion. Cisco spend a lot of thi cash on M&A activity. Dure the latest earn call, Cisco announc that it wa take AppDynam off the IPO tabl by dole out $3.7 billion for the applic perform manag startup. But incom investor need not worri - in the same vein, Cisco announc that it wa hike it quarterli dividend by 3 cent to 29 cents.Cisco stock now yield a gener 3.5%, among the highest yield in theDow Jone Industri Average.Bottom Line for Cisco StockCisco institut the dividend six year ago when it declar a quarterli payout of 6 cents, good for a modest 1.4% yield.

3 Internet of Things Stocks That Could Double Your Money,2/27/2017,"The Internet of Thing (IoT), which connect wearables, smart appliances, cars, and other gadget to each other and the cloud, is wide expect to be the next big growth market for chipmakers. Network giantCiscoestim that the number of connect devic worldwid will doubl from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion in 2020 -- indic that earli mover in the market could reap big reward over the next few years.Mani tech compani have highlight the IoT market as a major growth opportunity, but it can be tough for investor to narrow down the best long-term plays. Today, we'll take a look at three IoT stock which could potenti doubl over the next few year --Sierra Wireless(NASDAQ: SWIR) ,Skywork Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) , andSTMicroelectronics(NYSE: STM) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Sierra WirelessSierra Wireless is the world' biggest manufactur of 2G, 3G, and 4G embed modul and gateways. Sinc these compon are requir for most machine-to-machin (M2M) communications, Sierra is often regard as a ""pure play"" on the IoT market. Sierra face rise competit from cheaper chipmakers, especi in China, but the compani ha scale up over the past few year by acquir smaller wireless connect player like AnyData, Maingate, Mobiquithings, and GenX Mobile.Sierra recent broke a four-quart streak of annual revenu declin with 13% sale growth in the fourth quarter, which help it post 1% top line growth for fiscal 2016. That growth doesn't sound impressive, but analyst expect Sierra' revenu and non-GAAP earn to respect grow 7% and 22% thi year as enterpris spend accelerates, macro headwind fade, and competit from Chines competitor wanes.Sierra' low valuat indic that it price could eventu double. It EV/Sal ratio of 1.2 isverylow rel to larger chipmak likeTexa Instruments, which ha an EV/Sal ratio of 5.8. With an enterpris valu of just over $600 million, it' also a lucr takeov target for ani tech compani that want to instantli establish a market-lead posit in the M2M modul market.Skywork SolutionsSkywork Solut suppli RF (radio frequency) chip for the mobile, automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, home automation, industrial, and militari markets. These chip are also wide use for M2M communications. Skywork is primarili known as anApplesupplier, and Oppenheim & Co. previous estim that as much as 40% of it annual revenu came from chip for iDevices.Imag source: Skyworks.But look ahead, Skywork believ that higher sale of RF chip for IoT product like connect cars, smart home appliances, and wearabl will eventu offset the weight of it mobil chip business. Skyworks' quarterli revenu ha dip annual for three straight quarters, but analyst believ that it will return to posit growth thi quarter and post 9% sale growth for the full year thank to robust iPhon order and rise demand for IoT products.It non-GAAP earn are also expect to improv 12% thi year, partli due to a new $500 million buyback plan author in January. Skywork trail P/E of 19 is alreadi lower than it industri averag of 22, but it forward P/E of 14 look even cheaper. That low valuat indic that the stock could rise much higher over the next few years.STMicroelectronicsSTMicroelectronics, the largest chipmak in Europe, manufactur a wide varieti of chip for the automotive, industrial, security, and consum electron industries. It automot busi is it largest unit, and ha been lift by rise demand for connect infotain and navig system in higher-end vehicles. It also sell motion sensor for mobil devic and consum electronics.STMicro' revenu ha risen annual for the past two quarters, which broke amulti-yearstreak of revenu declines. That turnaround can be attribut to soar demand for automot chip and analog chip and sensor for consum electronics, which offset weaker sale of microcontrol and digit ICs. Analyst expect STMicro' revenu to rise 8% thi year, and it non-GAAP earn are expect to rise 128% on it return to top line growth.STMicro trade at 20 time forward earnings, which onli seem like a slight discount to the industri averag of 22 for broad line semiconductor makers. However, analyst expect STMicro' earn to grow at an averag rate of 49% per year over the next five year -- which give it a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.5. Sinc a PEG ratio under 1 is consid undervalued, STMicro look veri cheap rel to it long-term earn growth potential. That low valuat also make STMicro a veri lucr takeov target for bigger chipmak that want to diversifi into automot chips.Th key takeawaySierra Wireless, Skyworks, and STMicro should all benefit from the growth of the IoT market, and their low valuat indic that they have room to grow. I don't believ that these three stock will doubl within a few quarters, but I think that they might do so over sever year as demand for their compon heat up.10 stock we like better than Skywork SolutionsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, while the number of metric may make invest look complicated, not all of them are truli use when you'r look for stock worthi of your money and time.To help you invest better, we ask our contributor to explain the three most import valuat metric that everi investor should understand: the price-to-earn ratio, enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio, and price-to-cash flow ratio.P/ ratio: An easy-to-use, use metricKeith Noonan(Price-to-earn ratio):Th price-to-earn ratio is one of the most common metric for evalu a stock, and while it' not a help indic in everi scenario, it can provid insight on how the market valu a company' earnings.makeArticleAd();A the name implies, the P/E ratio is deriv by take the price of a share of stock, and divid it by the annual earn per share. Thi valu can then be compar to other P/Es, whether of an index, industry, or an individu company. A rel low P/E may be an indic that a stock is undervalu compar to it earnings, while a high P/E might suggest the opposite. As an example,Cisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) forward P/E of roughli 14 suggest the stock is inexpens when compar to the network and commun hardwar sector' averag of 24.7 and theS&P 500' averag forward earn multipl of roughli 18.Confus about valuat metrics? Know the import one helps. Imag source: Getti ImagesP/ ratio are use to evalu price in comparison to both past perform and anticip returns. Trailing-12-month P/E is calcul use actual earn over the last four quarterli report periods, while forward P/E typic is deriv use expect earn over the next fiscal year or 12-month period. Stock price are forward looking, and past perform won't necessarili be repeated, so forward P/E is often a better indic than trail P/E. However, the compani guidanc and analyst expect use to estim futur earn often disagree, and both can be inaccurateP/ ratio can be use tools, but they won't provid meaning insight in everi situation. Compani that are young or otherwis undergo period of rapid expans or high spend might have small profit or still be post losses, and price-to-earn ratio don't provid a use point of comparison for the valu of an equiti in these instances. Earn can also be affect by account practic and other factors, so dig deeper into a company' oper and financi and use other metric to supplement the inform present by P/E valu is essential.EV/FCF ratio: A metric that matter to busi ownersChuck Saletta(Enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio): When you own a compani outright, you care about your total capit structur -- your debtandyour equity. You also care deepli about how much cash the compani is generating, as cash is frequent much more valuabl to a busi than account profit are. That combin is what make the enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio such a power one to look at for investor who want to act and think like owner rather than speculators.Start with the enterpris valu side of that ratio. To calcul the enterpris valu for a company, start with it market capitalization, thensubtractani cash and equival andaddani debt, minor interest, and prefer shares. That basic tell you what the market is valu the compani at in a takeov situation, as ani new owner would benefit from it cash or be respons for it debts.Whil there' no offici definit of free cash flow, a common approach to calcul it is to start with a company' cash from oper and subtract ani capit expenses. Cash from oper measur how much cash a compani gener from run it business, while the capit expens acknowledg that gener that cash gener requir ongo invest in growth and renew of equipment.Calcul the enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio by divid the enterpris valu number by the free cash flow number. The ratio can be more valuabl in some situat than the more common P/E ratio, as it look at the bigger pictur of thing that typic matter more to true owners.Th tabl below show how you would calcul the ratio for technolog giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Note that Apple' EV/FCF ratio of 14.8 is below it price to earn ratio of 16.3. Sinc Appl carri more debt than it ha cash and equivalents, that lower EV/FCF ratio indic that Appl is do a strong job of convert the revenu in take in into cold, hard cash.MetricAmount (in Billions)Market Capitalization$712.06Cash and Equivalents$16.37Debt$87.55Enterpris Value$783.24Cash from Operations$65.42Capit Expenditures$12.46Fre Cash Flow$52.96EV/FCF Ratio14.8T by the authorStill, the use of the EV/FCF ratio to investor ha limits. Chief among them is that unless you have enough of a stake to truli influenc the company' use of it cash and capit structure, you have no control over with it will appropri use it cash or avoid overleverag on debt. In addition, the free cash flow number can be juic in the short term by underinvest in mainten expenditures. Those short-term gain can lead to long-term pain as equip ages.Despit those limits, the enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio is an incred use metric for investor who want to view their invest through the len of the busi owner. Even if you don't control what the compani doe with it cash, you can at least use chang in the number that make up that measur over time to help you judg whether you think it manag is put it cash to good use. And that' a number worthi of the time it take you to calcul and track it.P/CF ratio: Loss-mak compani can be valuabl tooNeha Chamaria(Price-to-cash-flow ratio): My fellow Fool Keith Noonan rightli point out how popular the P/E ratio is as a valuat metric, but as he also stated, sever factor can impact earnings. More importantly, earnings, as reflect on profit-and-loss statements, can be manipul by way of non-cash expenses, distort the true pictur of a company' financi health.What matter more to investor is a company' oper cash flow, which exclud non-cash item to reflect the actual cash a compani gener from core operations. After all, it is thi cash that the compani use to pay debts, reinvest in the business, or return to sharehold via dividend and share buybacks. That is whi I alway consid cash flow while analyz a company, and price-to-cash-flow ratio when valu a stock.To comput the P/CF ratio, all you have to do is divid a company' stock price by it cash flow per share. To deriv that, simpli look up the company' cash flow statement to find it cash from oper or net cash provid by oper activities, and divid that by the number of share outstand to get the cash flow per share. While there' no standard to defin an ""attractive"" P/CF, a lower ratio is gener better when look for valu stocks.Mor often than not, a stock that you may write off as pricey base on it P/E ratio could prove a lot more attract in term of P/CF, as appear to be the case with the broader market right now. Here' a solid exampl to help you understand why:Caterpillar Inc.(NYSE: CAT) .The heavy-equip manufacturer' stock ha soar a stagger 50% in the past year, as of thi writing. Given the persist headwind in the mine and oil and ga sectors, Caterpillar' ralli and the consist flow of rate upgrad from analyst have left mani investor bewildered. After all, how can a compani with a trail P/E of 88 or a forward P/E of 33 be undervalu -- especi if it earn are expect to declin thi year?Ent the P/CF ratio. You'll be surpris to see how dramat differ thing suddenli appear when you measur Caterpillar' base on it P/CF.CAT PE Ratio (TTM)data byYChartsAt onli 10 time P/CF, Caterpillar is anyth but overvalued. While Caterpillar' net earn have slump in recent years, it continu to gener strong cash flow. For perspective, Caterpillar gener almost $5.6 billion in oper cash flow compar to net loss worth $59 million dure the trail 12 months. That also explain how Caterpillar ha maintain it dividend despit plung profits.Of course, no valuat metric is foolproof, includ the P/CF ratio, but it' especi use in analyz compani that aren't profit or have taken big hit to their bottom line primarili becaus of macro factors, as is the case with Caterpillar. You could even go a step further and use the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. (Psst... Caterpillar isn't insan valu on a P/FCF basi either. Don't believ me? Go comput the ratio now that you'v learn about cash flows.)10 stock we like better than CaterpillarWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) Stock Is CRAZY Cheap,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTeva Pharmaceut Industri Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) desper need some good news head into it fourth quarter earn report. TEVA stock hit it lowest level in over a decad the week before, after it CEO resign abruptly.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Schedul (Modified)Th departur of CEO Erez Vigodman came amidst report of briberi investig in the company' home countri of Israel. And it came after a long declin in TEVA stock, driven by price pressure, question acquisitions, and a ""patent cliff"" for Teva Pharmaceutical' key drug, Copaxone.And while Q4 earn delivered, the news wasn't great. Revenu increas 33%, but that came almost sole from the acquisit ofAllergan plc's(NYSE:AGN) gener business. Teva Pharmaceut paid $40.5 billion in a transact that ha boost sale as well as Teva' debt load. Margin were pressured, reflect in non-GAAP EP that increas just 8% despit the 33% rise in sales.But the compani also reaffirm 2017 non-GAAP EP guidanc of $4.90-$5.30. That eas fear of anoth reduct in the 2017 outlook, which had been cut in Januari from $6-$6.50. The news wa enough to drive a ""relief rally"" in TEVA stock, which now ha climb more than 10% from it lows.Ther should be more upsid ahead, even if the road might be bumpy. Teva doe have numer risks, both near-term and long-term. But it also ha tremend potential, a cheap multiple, and a new CEO on the way. There' a turnaround opportun in TEVA stock and it doesn't look quit price in.Whi It' Crazi to Buy Teva StockAdmittedly, there are concern across the board for Teva stock. Thepat invalidationfor Copaxone, a multipl sclerosi treatment, put an estim 20% of revenue, and possibl 40%-plu of profit, at risk. On the Q4 call, CFO Eyal Desheh estim an $800 million cash flow impact in 2017, should competit enter immediately.That entranc - which would occur if Teva lose it appeal - also would shave 75 to 95 cent off EPS.Th combin of lower earn and higher debt after the Allergan deal rais anoth risk. Teva' leverag ratio (net debt to EBITDA) at the end of 2016 wa 4.7. That doesn't impli immedi risk of bankruptcy, to be sure. But Teva bond that matur in 2026 have fallen about 12% just sinc September. Clearly, the debt market are price in a greater, if still modest, possibl of a restructur that could wipe out TEVA stock.Th compani now face the challeng of find a new CEO.Both previou CEOsleft rel quickly, amid question of fit within Teva' cultur and clash with the company' board. The company' current bylaw requir the CEO to resid in Israel, though it' possibl those could be chang for the next candidate.9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.99The bear case for TEVA stock is that, yes, it is cheap - and for good reason. Declin profits, a $36 billion debt load, concern about gener pricing, and the loss of Copaxon all present signific risks. And those risk justifi a 7x multipl to the midpoint of 2017 EP guidance.Whi Teva Stock Is a Buy NonethelessThos concern are valid. But they'r also backward-looking.Teva ha numer option to improv it situation, and interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said on the Q4 call that Teva would ""leav no stone unturned"" in consid those options.And what' import to keep in mind is that the situat isn't all that dire. Yes, bond have fallen; but the yield to matur still is just 4.4%, impli a veri low chanc of bankruptci over the next decade. The leverag ratio could move abov 5x if Copaxon competit move in; but that remain a manag level. Thi isn'tVal Pharmaceut Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX); Teva' back isn't against the wall.Th compani ha options. TEVA is target a 3.5x leverag ratio, and like will consid asset sale as a path to those levels. There' still the possibl of a split between the brand and gener businesses, someth Wall Street ha long targeted. (That decis appear up to the new CEO, per the Q4 call.)Copaxon sale and profit aren't go to zero, even if gener competit enter immediately. And the same goe for Teva Pharmaceut earnings. Thi remain the largest gener drug manufactur in the world base on revenue. With rise health care cost a concern pretti much everywhere, and drug price a key part of those concerns, that' a major long-term competit advantag for Teva.Th Appl iPhon 8 Will Be Revolutionari (AAPL)And TEVA stock is cheap - even assum the worst about Copaxone. Use the low end of 2017 guidanc and the high end of the guid Copaxon impact still put 2017 EP near $4, and TEVA stock' P/E multipl below 10. Simpli stabil the busi at those level like impli a 12-13 multipl - and get TEVA stock to $50.It' alway difficult to time the bottom in ani stock. But the Q4 earn from Teva Pharmaceut seem to impli that the compani at least ha a handl on it challenges. Look forward, the debt load isn't so big that the compani is forc to do anything, and a new CEO will bring fresh eyes.Ther are concerns, to be sure. But Teva Pharmaceut ha a lot of tool still at it dispos to answer those concerns, and push TEVA stock higher.Th author ha no posit in ani secur mentioned.Mor From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stock to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stock With Explos Growth PotentialWatch Cisco Systems, Inc.

1 Number Cisco Wants Investors to Focus On,2/21/2017,"The headlin number fromCisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) fiscal second-quart report were far from impressive. Revenu slump by 2% year over year, driven by weak in the core switch and rout segments. Non-GAAP EP wa flat, aid by share buybacks.Ther were some bright spots. The secur busi expand by 14%, continu it impress streak of growth. And the collabor busi return to growth after a disappoint first quarter. But data center, anoth growth business, suffer a declin in revenue, and weak in the core busi overwhelm ani pocket of strength.Imag source: Cisco Systems.makeArticleAd();Cisco ha been shift toward a recurring-revenu busi model, embrac subscript softwar and servic as it aim to lower it depend on hardwar sales. Thi shift is hurt the company' results, knock at least 2 percentag point off revenu growth, accord to CFO Kelli Kramer.Th good news for Cisco investor is that progress is clearli be made. Defer revenue, particularli defer revenu relat to subscriptions, is soaring. With a weak top line, that' the number that Cisco want investor to focu on. However, investor shouldn't ignor the price tag associ with the acquisit that are help to drive that growth.$17.1 billion and countingDef revenu is book as a liabil on the balanc sheet when a compani receiv payment for a product or servic which it ha yet to deliver. In the case of a subscription, thi defer revenu is transform into real revenu over the length of the contract. Subscript busi that take payment upfront for softwar or servic that will be deliv over time often use defer revenu growth as a proxi for futur revenu growth. It'sfar from a perfect measure, but it give investor a rough way to judg a subscript company' performance.Cisco' total defer revenu reach $17.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 13% year over year. Defer revenu relat to servic grew 9% year over year to $10.5 billion, while product defer revenu jump 19% to $6.6 billion. The rapid growth of the product defer revenu wa mostli due to a surg in softwar and subscriptions.Def revenu from softwar and subscript wa up 51% year over year at the end of the second quarter, reach $4 billion. Thi explos growth ha yet to drive meaning revenu growth for the compani overall, but the number are start to get big. Roughli two-third of thi growth can be attribut to the security, collaboration, and wireless businesses, with the rest come from Cisco' larger segments.Even grow by 51%, $4 billion of subscript defer revenu doesn't yet mean much for a compani that doe nearli $50 billion in revenu each year. Cisco remain highli depend on hardwar sales, and that' unlik to chang anytim soon. But if the compani can continu grow it subscript busi at a rapid pace, revenu should eventu start consist grow onc again.Driv growth with acquisitionsOn pillar of Cisco' growth strategi is acquisitions. The compani ha made plenti of softwar acquisit in recent years, ad to it security, collaboration, and Internet of Thing portfolio. But thedeal announc in Januari to acquir AppDynamicsrepres an escalation. Cisco agre to pay $3.7 billion for the applic monitor company, a stagger 16 time sales.Th deal make strateg sense, and it will help Cisco further fill out it softwar business. But the price tag suggest that Cisco is put growth ahead of discipline. Cisco ha ten of billion of dollar of excess cash earn next to nothing, but dramat overpay for start-up is a good way to wast it.Mor softwar acquisit are likely, especi if Cisco is abl to repatri some of it foreign cash at favor rate in the near future. Addit deal will help turbocharg the company' shift to softwar and subscriptions, but investor should be concern about the company' newfound willing to pay excess premiums.Th rapid growth of Cisco' defer revenu is an encourag sign that the company' shift to subscript and softwar is make progress and will eventu pay off. But acquisit are drive a portion of that growth, and Cisco is pay a high price for AppDynam to keep the ball rolling.A a Cisco investor, I have mix feel about all of this. The push toward subscript and softwar is the right move, but the price tag for AppDynamics, which Cisco pluck right befor it plan IPO, is troubling. I'm hope that the compani will be a littl less eager to close deal in the future.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Amazon's Chime Challenge Microsoft's Skype and Cisco's Spark?,2/21/2017,"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recent introduc Chime, an enterpris collabor servic for onlin meetings, video conferencing, voic calls, chat, and content sharing. Chime' app work on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchron across all platform via Amazon Web Servic (AWS).Chim come in three version -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voic and video call and chat; Chime Plus, which add screen share and the integr of compani directories; and Chime Pro, which add tool for scheduling, hosting, recording, and person meet for up to 100 people.Imag source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Thes featur indic that Amazon is take aim at collabor tool likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rival alreadi too deepli entrench in the enterpris market for Amazon to disrupt? Let' take a closer look at Amazon' game plan to find out.Ent the crowd Saa marketAmazon' AWS, which ha an annual run rate of $14 billion, is the biggest cloud infrastructur platform in the world. It' sever time larger than it closest competitor, Microsoft' Azure. But while AW domin the cloud platform (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which host storag space, process power, and other tool for compani and develop -- it doesn't have a major presenc in the Saa (softwar as a service) market yet.Th Saa market is the crowded, consumer-fac side of the cloud, which includ servic like Microsoft' Offic 365, Dynam CRM, and Skype. The lion' share of Microsoft' commerci cloud revenu run rate of $14 billion is gener by those Saa product instead of Azure. Microsoft ha also been expand Skype' capabl as an enterpris collabor tool with Microsoft Teams, which enhanc Skype' cloud-bas commun featur and tightli integr the servic into Offic 365.Microsoft Teams. Imag source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, network giant Cisco aggress bundl softwar and secur product with it routers, switches, and unifi comput systems. Those bundl includ collabor tool like Spark, the cloud-bas platform for messages, meetings, and call it launch in late 2015. Last quarter, Cisco' collabor revenu rose 4% annual to $1.06 billion -- make it it third largest busi after it core busi of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the onli player in the crowd field of cloud-bas collabor tools.Alphabet' Googl ha been promot Hangout to enterpris custom over the past year,Boxha ad collabor tool on top of it cloud storag platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix' GoToMeet video conferenc platform for the same purposes. However, all these challeng notabl lack Microsoft and Cisco' clout in the enterpris market.That' whi Amazon believ it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also ha leverag -- the grow import of AW to enterpris customers. Amazon like believ that by offer Chime as an extens of AW (especi with it 30-day free trial) to it enterpris custom base, it can gain a foothold in the crowd ""unifi communication"" platform market.Amazon previous launch enterpris Saa product like WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever releas offici growth figur for those products. However, most industri watcher believ that those product are still dwarf by compar solut from Microsoft and Cisco. Thi strongli indic that AWS' domin of the PaaS/Iaa market doesn't guarante that Chime will becom a Skype or Spark killer anytim soon. Chime Pro also cost more than Skype for Busi -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plan to undercut it way into the market.Th key takeawayChim sound like a logic way for AW to straddl the PaaS/Iaa and Saa markets, but it' easier said than done. The market for cloud-bas unifi commun platform is incred crowded, and it' doubt that a new servic -- even one bundl with AW -- can claim a meaning slice of the market. However, Amazon investor should still keep an eye out for futur Saa product to see if the compani can eventu challeng heavyweight like Microsoft and Cisco.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Better Buy: Cisco Systems, Inc. vs. General Electric",2/14/2017,"At first glance,Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andGener Electric(NYSE: GE) don't seem that similar. The former sell network hardwar and software, while the latter sell a wide array of industri product and servic for the utility, healthcare, transportation, aviation, and automot industries.But if we look closer, some similar appear. Both compani are Dow compon and are gener own for incom instead of growth. Both compani are also aggress expand into theInternet of Thing (IoT), which link variou object to each other and the cloud. Cisco estim that the total number of connect devic across the IoT, includ GE' industri machinery, will doubl from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion in 2020.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Cisco and GE are both slow-growth plays, yet both stock have ralli more than 50% over the past five years. But sinc past perform doesn't guarante futur gains, we should take a closer look at their core busi to see if they can keep rise over the next few years.How fast are Cisco and GE growing?Cisco' revenu stay nearli flat at $49.2 billion in fiscal 2016. But after exclud the sale of it set-top box to Technicolor for $600 million, it full-year revenu rose 3% to $48.7 billion. Cisco' revenu grew 1% annual on that same ""normalized"" basi dure the first quarter, but is expect to declin 2%-4% annual dure the second quarter. Analyst expect Cisco' report revenu to fall 2% in fiscal 2017, but potenti rebound 2% in 2018.That lacklust growth is mainli attribut to the sluggish growth of it core busi of network router and switches, which gener nearli half it revenu last quarter. The onli part of Cisco which post consist growth is it cybersecur business, which post 11% sale growth dure the first quarter but onli account for 4% of it top line. Look ahead, Cisco is expect to acquir more compani to strengthen it hardwar and softwar bundl while boost it top line growth.Imag source: Cisco.Gener Electric' revenu rose 5% to $123.7 billion in fiscal 2016. The company' top line receiv a big boost from it $10 billion purchas of Alstom' power divis in late 2015. GE' core busi also grew on robust demand across the aviation, renewables, healthcare, and oil and ga industries. It healthcar busi benefit from solid growth in China, and it oil and ga busi wa lift by reboundingoil prices. Order for wind turbin also rose on an increas appetit for renew energi solut worldwide.GE' backlog -- a key indic of futur demand -- rose 2% to $321 billion in 2016. Look ahead, analyst expect GE' revenu to rise 2% in fiscal 2017 and 7% growth in 2018. But on an organ basis, which exclud currenc impacts, acquisitions, and divestments, GE expect it revenu to rise 3%-5% in fiscal 2017.How profit are Cisco and GE?Sinc Cisco and GE are both heavili expos to currenc headwind and often acquir or divest units, which distort year-over-year comparisons, they report their earn in both GAAP and non-GAAP figures.On a non-GAAP basi -- which exclud currenc impacts, stock-bas compensation, certain acquisitions, divestments, and other charg -- Cisco' earn rose 8% in fiscal 2016. GAAP-adjust earnings, which includ the gain from the set-top box divestment, rose 21%. Analyst expect Cisco' non-GAAP earn to remain nearli flat in 2017 and rise 5% in 2018.GE' total earn remain flat on a GAAP basi in fiscal 2016. However, it non-GAAP earn (which includ it industri oper and relat verticals) rose 14% dure the year. On that basis, analyst expect GE' earn to rise 10% in 2017 and anoth 16% in 2018.Dividend and valuationsCisco current pay a forward yield of 3.3%, which is support by a payout ratio of 47%. It' rais that dividend annual for the past six years. GE also pay a forward yield of 3.3%, but it ha a much less sustain payout ratio of 106%, due to the Alstom acquisit throttl it cash flows. GE rais it dividend by a penni last December, but that wa it first hike intwo years.Cisco trade at 15 time earnings, which is lower than the S&P 500' current P/E of 24 and the industri averag of 25 for network and commun devic makers. GE trade at 25 time earnings, which is higher than the S&P 500' multipl but lower than the averag P/E of 39 for diversifi machineri companies.Th winner: CiscoGener Electr initi seem like a better pick than Cisco, sinc it ha better top and bottom line growth and a more diversifi business. But GE' poor record of dividend hikes, high payout ratio, and frothi valuat indic that it' a riskier buy than Cisco at current prices. With the market hover near all-tim highs, I'd rather stick with Cisco as a fundament cheap play with a reliabl dividend.10 stock we like better than Gener ElectricWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What to Expect When Cisco Systems Reports Earnings,2/14/2017,"Expect are low go intoCisco Systems'(NASDAQ: CSCO) fiscal second-quart report. The network hardwar giant expect the troubl of the first quarter to continue, with it guidanc call for a sizabl year-over-year revenu decline, even after exclud divestitures.Growth busi like collaboration, data center, and secur have help the compani grow in recent quarter despit weak in the core switch and rout segments, but two of those busi suffer declin dure the first quarter. Here' what to look for when Cisco report on Wednesday.What analyst are expectingTh averag analyst estim call for a year-over-year revenu declin of 3.2%, to $11.55 billion. That' near the midpoint of Cisco' guidanc rang -- a declin of 2% to 4%. Cisco' outlook exclud revenu from the SP Video CPE business, which the compani agre to sell back in 2015.makeArticleAd();That deal close in Novemb 2015, about one month into the fiscal second quarter. The discrep between Cisco' report and adjust revenu in the second quarter will onli includ one month of that divest revenue, and the transact will be fulli lap in the fiscal third quarter.Imag source: Cisco Systems.Cisco report a revenu declin of 3% and an adjust revenu increas of 1% dure the first quarter, so the company' second-quart guidanc repres a deterioration. The companypoint to global uncertainty, driven by the U.S. presidenti election, as one reason for it weak guidance. Cisco isn't model ani improv go forward, but it doe believ that business-friendli polic from the Trump administr could revers some of these headwinds.Cisco expect to produc GAAP earn per share (EPS) between $0.42 and $0.47, and non-GAAP EP between $0.55 and $0.57, dure the second quarter. That compar to GAAP EP of $0.62 and non-GAAP EP of $0.57 dure the prior-year period.A $519 million tax benefit boost GAAP EP last year, so the steep declin call for in Cisco' guidanc isn't someth to worri about. Analyst are expect non-GAAP EP of $0.56, right at the midpoint of Cisco' guidanc range.Despit the weak number Cisco expect to report, it' like that the compani will announc a dividend boost along with it second-quart report. Cisco announc a 24% increas to it quarterli dividend in Februari of last year, along with a massiv $15 billion share-buyback authorization. Ani dividend increas thi year will almost certainli be smaller, but a high single-digit or low double-digit percentag boost would still be a nice reward for long-term investors.Pay attent to the growth businessesCisco' first-quart results, while beat analyst estimates, were disappoint due to the sever slowdown of the company' main growth businesses. The data center segment, which wa grow by more than 20% annual as recent as late 2015, ha now been weak for multipl quarters. The segment post a 3% year-over-year declin dure the first quarter, with the compani blame a shift from blade server to rack server for the disappoint performance.Th collabor segment, which produc about $4.4 billion of revenu annually, ha also slow down. The segment grew by 9% dure fiscal 2016, but the first quarter, saw a 3% year-over-year decline. One thing hurt the top line is Cisco' ongo shift to subscript software. Collaboration-def revenu rose by 14% in the first quarter, and order growth wa solid despit the revenu weakness.Th secur busi ha manag to continu grow at a double-digit rate, driven, in part, by acquisitions. Secur revenu expand by 11% year over year dure the first quarter, and investor should expect to see continu growth in the second quarter. Thi will help offset some of the weak in other areas.Cisco is a compani in transition, shift toward softwar and subscript while remain depend on sale of it core switch and rout hardware. The first quarter wa lackluster, and the second quarter will be wors if Cisco hit it guidance. A like dividend hike will provid some good news, but investor should be prepar for anoth weak quarterli report.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Cisco Systems",2/13/2017,"Consistently, one of the more popular stock peopl enter into theirstock option watchlistat Stock Option Channel is Cisco System Inc (Symbol: CSCO).

The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $25 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of $1.19. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 4.8% return against the $25 commitment, or a 3.6% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to CSCO' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco System Inc see it share declin 21.4% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $23.81 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the $1.19 from $25), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 3.6% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annual 3.6% figur actual exce the 3.3% annual dividend paid by Cisco System Inc, base on the current share price of $31.84. And yet, if an investor wa to buy the stock at the go market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downsid becaus the stock would have to lose 21.43% to reach the $25 strike price.Alway import when discuss dividend is the fact that, in general, dividend amount are not alway predict and tend to follow the up and down of profit at each company. In the case of Cisco System Inc, look at the dividend histori chart for CSCO below can help in judg whether the most recent dividend is like to continue, and in turn whether it is a reason expect to expect a 3.3% annual dividend yield.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the June 2018 expiration, for sharehold of Cisco System Inc (Symbol: CSCO) look to boost their incom beyond the stock' 3.3% annual dividend yield.

2 Rock Solid Cheap Stocks with P/Es Under 15,2/13/2017,"With the market hover near all-tim highs, it might seem tough to find ""cheap"" stock that are still worth buying. But with the S&P 500' P/E ratio current near a multi-year high of 24, investor should focu on undervalu stock with less room to fall. Let' take a closer look at two big tech name that have P/E ratio of 15 or less --Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) andHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) .Cisco SystemsCisco is one of the world' largest vendor of network hardwar and software. It core busi of router and switch are slow growth -- sale of router fell 4% in fiscal 2016, while sale of switch stay flat. Those two busi account for nearli half of it top line dure the year.Imag source: Cisco.makeArticleAd();Both busi face twomajor headwinds-- the rise of cheaper rival likeHuawei, and compani likeArista Networks, which special in hardwar for SDN (software-defin networking) solutions. SDN (or cloud networking) platform reduc the need for on-sit hardwar like router and switches.However, Cisco is diversifi away from those busi with increas invest in higher-growth busi likecybersecurity, collaboration, and servic provid video solut -- which it can bundl with it network hardware. It also expand it presenc in the Internet of Thing (IoT) market with it acquisit of Jasper Technologies, and will strengthen it networkwid app analyt capabl with it plan purchas of AppDynamics.Cisco plan to use it robust free cash flow ($12.4 billion over the past 12 months) to buy more companies, boost it earn with buybacks, and pay out dividends. On the surface, Cisco' growth look glacial, with analyst expect a 2% sale declin and nearli flat earn growth thi year. But Cisco' P/E of 15 is also much lower than it industri averag of 25, and it forward dividend yield of 3.3% easili beat the S&P 500' averag yield of 2% -- make it a good conserv incom play for 2017.Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett-Packard Enterpris retain HP' enterpris hardwar and softwar busi after split with the PC, printer, and imag businesses. But like mani of it industri peers, HPE ha struggl to grow it top line amid sluggish enterpris spending, macroeconom issues, currenc headwinds, and rise competit from smaller rivals. Analyst expect HPE' revenu to dip 2% thi year and remain flat next year.HPE' CEO is Meg Whitman, who previous led both halv of HP. Whitman' core strategi ha been to streamlin the enterpris busi with divestments, spinoffs, and layoffs. Prior to the big split, HP exit the highli competit public cloud market to focu more on on-sit and hybrid deployments.Imag source: HPE.Aft the split, HPE agre to spin off and merg it slow-growth IT servic unit withComput Scienc Corp.in an $8.5 billion deal, then agre to a similar spin-off of it ""non-core"" applic deliveri management, big data, and enterpris secur busi toMicro Focu Internationalin an $8.8 billion deal. Those spin-merg result in sever round of layoffs, but those lower expens boost HPE' margins. That' whi analyst expect HPE' earn to grow 6% thi year and anoth 1% next year.To pivot away from slow-growth businesses, HPE agre to buy smaller compani in high growth market -- includ supercomput maker SGI for $275 million and hyperconverg infrastructur vendor SimpliV for $650 million. Both acquisit strengthen HPE' posit in the hybrid cloud market. As HPE pivot toward more of these high growth businesses, their revenu could juic up it top line growth again.HPE' P/E of 13 is much lower than it industri averag of 21, and it pay a forward yield of 1%. That yield is low, but HPE' payout ratio of 12% indic that it ha plenti of room to rais it dividend in the near future.Th key takeawayMani low P/E stock tend to have low growth potential. Cisco and HPE' growth won't impress analyst anytim soon, but their low valuat will limit their downsid potenti dure market downturns. That stabil could be valuabl if the market' lofti valuat catch up to it later thi year.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"3 Big Bets Cisco Systems, Inc. Is Making -- Will They Be Enough?",2/10/2017,"Cisco System Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) ha been best known in the past for it enterpris network hardware, but the compani continu to build out and grow it other segment with some interest recent innov and acquisitions. Here are some of the area of growth Cisco is bet on, the pressur it' get from new competitor likeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , and whi the stock look like a fine hold as the compani transit for the future.1: Build smart, connect citiesIn a recent blog post, Cisco manag said that cloud comput is ""the fourth industri revolution."" The compani estim that by 2020, over 90% of total data center traffic will be via cloud networks. While there are mani compani work to provid servic for individuals' and companies' cloud needs, Cisco is gear up to offer it servic to citi around the world.Cisco launch the ""Smart+Connect Citi Platform"" at the Smart Citi Expo World Congress 2016 in Barcelona in November, and the compani say thi servic is ""a central layer for address the infrastructur need to connect cameras, water meters, traffic meters, and so on in a reliable, secure, robust and seamless manner."" Thi initi wa recent implement in Jaipur, India, which join Hamburg, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Kansa City, Missouri; and Adelaide, Australia as test smart cities. The video below show the CIO of Adelaid explain the import Cisco ha play in hi city.makeArticleAd();2: Becom an all-encompass IoT platform""Internet of Things"" ha becom a buzzword in 2016, but realli it just describ the grow trend of consum or otherwis low-tech item that are be connect to the internet and to each other, usual through a wireless cloud network. In fact, the smart citi initi is mostli about IoT on citi level. Estim on just how big thi market could be vari widely, but most analyst predict it could continu grow by ten ofbillionsof devic in the next few years.Cisco is increasingli make itself the bedrock for variou part of thi ecosystem, includ the actual hardwar that make these consum product connect possible, the connect through cloud networks, and the secur to make sure the IoT connect isn't easili compromised. Cisco acquir a cloud-bas IoT compani call Jasper Technolog last March for $1.4 billion, which, among other things, enabl more data-track and IoT management. Thi acquisit and other like it, along with Cisco' own innov in thi space, have help the compani to launch variou new product and bundl into thi space recently.Similar to Cisco' smart+connect citi push, the compani believ it ha the breadth of expertis and support to be the IoT platform for enterpris and government accounts. Rememb that Cisco alreadi ha a larg footprint in these spaces, so it might be easier for them to win over these big client as they seek an IoT solution.Imag source: Cisco Systems.3: CybersecurityWhil the first two area abov are incred excit in term of what they could mean for the futur of the digit world, they also open up the world to mani more risk in the form of cyber-threats. A recent intensifi focu on hack threat and the need to build secur solut throughout cloud networks, IoT platforms, and all other connect technolog creat an opportun Cisco is take advantag of.In February, the compani launch Cisco Firepower, a new firewal series, and the compani say it advanc secur system have been proven to help custom ""dramat reduc time to detect of attacks."" Throughout the year, the compani also launch new tool such as Cisco Umbrella and Umbrella Roaming, which are increas defens on router and VPN devic to block suspici activity. In September, Cisco acquir CloudLock, a compani that help provid integr secur solut for cloud-bas networks.Cisco' secur revenu in it fiscal Q1 end Oct. 29 rose 11% from the year-earli quarter to about $540 million. Even though that make up less than 5% of Cisco' total revenue, manag believ that have the focu and expertis in thi area will help them win over more busi within it other segment as consum and busi start to consid the need for the most secur network possibl a top priority.Can Cisco fend off competition?Cisco' tradit markets, which still make up the bulk of sales, have declin in recent quarters. Switching, which still make up nearli a third of total sales, slump 7% in the most recent quarter year over year. Overall, even with the growth above, total sale in the quarter gain a paltri 1%. Additionally, manag gave less-than-excit guidanc for earli fiscal 2017.More concern is that in the company' new growth areas, it face some seriou competition. The biggest of them is Amazon Web Servic (AWS), which offer both public and privat cloud host solutions, as well as IoT solutions, usual for a lower cost than tradit options. The servic ha success stori from some big name likeNetflixandComcast, just to name a few, which ha help rais it prestige. In term of security, Amazon provid cloud servic to U.S. intellig agencies, so clearly, secur is import to them as well. AW is grow quickli -- up nearli 50% year over year in the most recent quarter to over $3.5 billion.Th earli success of the segment abov are encouraging. Additionally, Cisco ha been abl to gain a lot of expertis and valu from acquir smaller tech compani in these high-growth segments, and Cisco is in a great posit to continu that strategi with around $70 billion in cash that it' like to start deploy more heavili in the quarter and year to come. While Cisco will certainli face increas growth pressur ahead, especi with AW disrupt thi space, it look to be make some smart move to transit it focus. Finally, Cisco is trade at just 15 time earnings, just 2.5 time book valu (compar with Amazon' P/B at 21.7 times), and ha a 3.3% dividend yield that continu to grow. It look like there' plenti of reason to hold Cisco to see how these market transform in the year ahead -- and how thi behemoth tech compani will play a part in them.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But the compani fell prey to a major faux pa in the technolog world - it didn't innov fast enough, and FEY stock is now pay the price.makeArticleAd();Source:Fortun Brainstorm TECH via FlickrIn 2014, the cloud busi model wa break onto the scene, and it wa creat enough of a stir that even major player likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) were make signific move into the new market. It wa a lesson FireEy learn too late, as evidenc by the company' recent quarterli earn report.Despit a major push and a plethora of incent to boost sales, FireEye' revenu of $184.7 million miss Wall Street' estim of $191 million. But the toplin figur wasn't the onli concern, as FireEy guid to a 3% declin in first-quart revenue, compar to the Street' expect 5% growth.Among the myriad of problem face the company, includ slower corpor enterpris spend and increas competit in the cybersecur market, FireEye' late restructur into a cloud-subscript model is almost unforgiv - especi when blue-chip secur firm were alreadi head that direction.But there is a bright side for FEY stock investors, at least over the short term. Bar ani other major surpris or manag short-sighted (CFO Mike Berri and board chairman David DeWalt are both step down, which could help), the worst appear to be alreadi factor into FEYE' price. As such, liter ani posit news for the compani could kick off a short-term bounce.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowA usual, potenti driver for such a bounc would come from FEYE' sentiment backdrop. For instance, Thomson/First Call report that 21 of the 31 analyst follow FEY stock rate the share a ""hold"" or worse. The fact that there aren't more ""sell"" rate after last week' quarterli report tell me that Wall Street is readi to reward FireEy for move in the right direction.

With said beat now out of the way, FEY should trend higher, with ani posit news provid addit lift.Thos trader look to take a risk on an FEY comeback over the short-term might want to consid a March $12/$13 bull call spread. At last check, thi spread wa offer at 19 cents, or $19 per pair of contracts.

Can FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?,2/8/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt ha been a rough ride forFireEy Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) stock. FEY stock went public in Septemb 2013, price at $20 per share. FireEy doubl on it first day of trading; it clear $90 by March. A quick plung followed, and after a modest rebound, share have been in a consist downtrend, fall from abov $50 in June 2015 to a current price around $11.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)With FEY stock now near an all-tim low, investor are look to see if there' a way to salvag some value.FireEy itself ha been in the middl of a turnaround, to be sure. The compani ha cut costs, and work to shift from legaci hardwar product to a more cloud-bas model. But the departur of the chairman and CFO after last week' Q4 earn report could hamper those plans. Already, restructur ha left sever key posit open and affect FireEye' sale and market efforts.Ther is a case for the compani to be a takeov target, which almost certainli would valu FEY stock abov current levels. But investor expect a deal in the near-term seem like to be disappointed. FireEy could be of interest to a larger player, but it still ha a lot of work to do.What FireEy Need To DoIt' alway tempt to see a M&A opportun in a growth stock that ha fallen on hard times. Accord to aBloombergreport last year, FireEy alreadi ha turn down sever buyout offers. Those deal almost certainli would have been struck at a price much higher than $11. Surely, the rumor buyer - among themIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) - would still be interest at a lower price?12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenTh problem, however, is that FEYE' busi look much wors than it did even six month ago. 2016 as a whole doesn't look that bad, to be sure: Revenu increas 15% over 2015, and the compani manag to cut non-GAAP oper expens by 3% at the same time. That combin move FireEy closer to profitability: The non-GAAP loss narrow from $1.61 per share to $0.99 per share.Thos number don't show the real issue, however. Billings, which reflect revenu ad in the quarter - not necessarili recogn sale - increas just 3% for the year. More concerning: That figur becam progress wors as the year went on. In Q1, bill growth wa over 20%; in Q3, the figur increas just 4%. Q4 bill then declin 14% and the midpoint of Q1 guidanc impli a 25% decreas next quarter.Noth good will happen for FEY stock until that trend is reversed. Acquir don't want to buy a declin business. FireEy is alreadi both unprofit and burn cash. Declin bill will onli worsen it losses. And FEY can't blame it market. PeerFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT) announc 22% bill growth in it first quarter on the same day FEY stock wa plung after it report. To be even consid as an M&A target with a market cap still over $2 billion, FireEy ha to fix it sale problems.Can FEY Stock Rebound Through M&A?For it part, FireEy manag believ those issu will be fixed. After Q4, outgo CFO Mike Berri said the compani would return to growth in the second half of 2017. New cloud-bas offer and the recent roll out Helix platform are project to start boost sale by then.Th huge declin in product bill - down 50% in Q4, and guid the same in Q1 - will start to be lapped. And CEO Kevin Mandia point out on the Q4 call that FireEy for month had no head of sales, either worldwid or in Europe.Combin with easi comparisons, FEY expect to get back to bill growth toward the end of thi year, which like would translat into revenu growth in earli 2018. But until that happens, it' hard to expect much in the way of M&A interest.3 Reason Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingWhil FireEy seem confid in it prospects, the price of FEY stock show that mani observ remain skeptical. The compani is shift from product to clouds, but there' a real concern that it' ""too little, too late,"" with rival like Fortinet andPalo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW) have beaten FireEy to market.Ani sale of FEY is go to depend on that top-lin rebound take place. Lower spend is nice in the near-term, but isn't go to be the primari consider of a strateg acquir like IBM or Cisco. A larger compani look to enter the cybersecur market through a takeout of FireEy stock is go to plan for substanti cost cut regardless. Whether FEY make those cut in 2017 or IBM doe so in 2019 doesn't much chang the possibl of a takeov - or the price to be paid for FireEy stock.Simpli put, it' revenu that will drive FEYE' attract as an M&A target. Thus, it' revenu that will drive the perform of FireEy stock thi year. Sale perform seem to hing on whether the compani succe in pivot away from it legaci applianc business. That put a lot of pressur on Helix, in particular. The platform may rise to the challenge, to be sure. But ani investor expect a takeout of FEY stock should at the least, be patient.

How FireEye Inc. Burned to the Ground,2/7/2017,"Share ofFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) plung 16% on Feb. 3 after the cybersecur firm post a big fourth quarter sale miss and a weak first quarter forecast and reveal the departur of key executives. FireEye' revenu stay roughli flat year-over-year at $184.7 million, but that repres a big slowdown from it double-digit growth in previou quarter and miss forecast by $6.3 million.Bil fell 14% annual to $221.8 million, which miss the company' prior forecast of $230 million to $250 million. Gross margin fell one percentag point annual to 74%, but oper margin of -1% -- boost by layoff and cost cut measur -- repres a solid improv from -28% a year earlier. That' whi FireEye' non-GAAP net loss narrow from $0.36 per share a year ago to just $0.03 per share, beat estim by $0.13.Imag source: FireEye.makeArticleAd();But look ahead, FireEy expect it first quarter revenu to fall 1%-5% annually, which would mark it first year-over-year declin sinc it 2013 IPO. Analyst had expect 5% growth. But on the bottom line, FireEy expect a non-GAAP loss between $0.26-$0.28 per share, which repres an improv over it loss of $0.47 per share a year earlier. Unfortunately, analyst were expect a narrow loss of $0.24. To top off all that bad news, FireEy disclos that CFO Mike Berri and Execut Chairman and former CEO David DeWalt were both leav the company.Fac with all these challenges, it isn't surpris that FireEy trade at just over half it IPO price of $20. Let' discuss the main headwind face FireEye, and whi they could blow the compani even further off cours thi year.How FireEy lost it sparkFireEy provid a threat detect platform that intercept attack befor they breach a company' network perimeter. It serv over 5,000 custom in 67 countries, includ nearli half of the Forb Global 2000. It wa also the first cybersecur firm to be certifi by the U.S. Depart of Homeland Secur back in 2015.FireEye' ""best in breed"" reput and the rise of data breach worldwid fuel it explos revenu growth over the past few years, but that growth is decelerating. It annual revenu rose 163% in 2014, 46% in 2015, but just 15% in 2016. That slowdown can mainli be attribut to slower enterpris spending, tougher competit in the threat detect market, and a shift away from on-sit applianc toward more scalabl cloud-bas subscript services.Imag source: Getti Images.FireEy is still consid the ""best in breed"" player in threat detection, but compani likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are now challeng it with bundl threat detect services. Cisco' acquisit of SourceFir and ThreatGRID enhanc it abil to detect threat across network power by it hardwar and software. Demand for Cisco' bundl secur solut notabl boost it cybersecur revenu by 13% to nearli $2 billion in fiscal 2016.Microsoft recent launch Window Defend ATP (Advanc Threat Protection) for Window 10, which use the company' cloud-bas Secur Graph (contain data from over 1 billion Window devic worldwide) to intercept threat in a similar way. The tech giant also recent pledg to invest$1 billion annuallyinto it cybersecur business, which could make it tough for smaller stand-alon player like FireEy to stay competitive.Widen the moat is a sluggish processFireEye' core turnaround strategi is to pivot away from it sluggish on-sit applianc busi and toward FireEy as a Servic (FaaS), a scalabl cloud-bas platform that continu detect and analyz threat without the need for appliances, on-sit secur teams, or manag secur servic providers.Last November, FireEy expand that ecosystem with Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid, which ad new private, hybrid, and public cloud deploy option for mid-siz and larger businesses. It also launch Helix, an all-in-on platform that bundl it network, endpoint, Threat Analyt Platform, Advanc Threat Intelligence, and FireEy Secur Orchestr in a unifi system under a singl user interface.However, turn custom toward that cloud-bas platform is veri tough on FireEye' revenu growth, sinc the compani gener more upfront revenu per applianc sale than cloud-bas subscription. That' whi analyst expect it revenu to rise just 4% in fiscal 2017. FireEy hope that thi growth will stabil over time, but it dismal bill growth in the fourth quarter indic that it' a tough balanc act to pull off.Th silver liningOn the bright side, CEO Kevin Mandia ha revers FireEye' widen loss and slow down it cash burn rate by downsiz it oper over the past few quarters. The bad news is that reduc FireEye' sale and market spend (down 38% annual last quarter) could crippl it abil to combat other competitor and bundl challeng like Cisco and Microsoft.Therefore, I believ that FireEy is in seriou trouble, and that it onli real salvat is a buyout. Unfortunately, that might not happen anytim soon if potenti suitor believ that the compani can be bought out at a lower price in the near future.10 stock we like better than FireEyeWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Ubiquiti’s Run Continue in 2017?,2/7/2017,"While mani technolog investor no doubt enjoy major gain in the high-profil large-cap tech name in 2016, mid-cap wireless companyUbiqu Networks(NASDAQ: UBNT) also had itself quit a year, rocket 125% in just the past 12 months.

With the recent move in the stock, investor may be wonder if they'v miss the boat, but I think the momentum can continu in 2017 for the follow reasons.makeArticleAd();IMAG SOURCE: UBIQU NETWORKS, INC.Unifi goe up the valu chainA I mentioned, the star of 2016 for Ubiqu wa Unifi, which grew 75% in the Septemb quarter. Thi segment make low-cost enterpris hardwar products, such as wireless access points, switches, routers, secur cameras, and VOIP phones, along with softwar that allow IT profession to track larg network from a singl user interface. Ubiquiti' low-cost busi model -- the compani employ almost no sale forc or servic professionals, and hire a limit number of ""all-star"" engin -- enabl it to produc solid wi-fi product at rock-bottom prices, and the product line caught fire in 2016. In January, however, the compani unveil a new line of advanc product aim at higher-end customers, which is the turf of IT giant such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andHP(NYSE: HPE) . The new product includ the US-16-XG Switch for $599 and a new Wave 2 access point for $349. These are much higher price point than tradit Unifi products, but still much lower than high-end access point vendor such as Cisco' Meraki ($1,399), HP' Aruba ($1,395) andBrocade's(NASDAQ: BRCD) Rucku ($1,295). Should Ubiqu make inroad into higher-end deployments, these new product could drive Ubiquiti' already-sky-high 35% oper margin even higher.Ubiqu look as if it is final make it move to disrupt legaci IT players, just as promin ventur capitalist (and former Ubiqu board member) Bill Gurley predict in 2014:""The fact that Cisco ha never had a price disruptor over 30 year seem to violat the rule of the ""Innovator' Dilemma."" I think mani peopl believ that a disrupt from underneath is overdue. If I had to bet on anyon pull that off it would be [Ubiqu CEO] Robert [Pera].""Airmax refreshWhil Unifi wa the star of 2016, Ubiquiti' biggest segment is still Servic Provider, which account for 59% of total revenues. Under the Airmax and Airfib brands, thi segment make high-pow radio that beam Wi-Fi over long distanc while achiev cable-lik speeds. These radio are the build block for Wireless Internet Servic Provid (WISPs) in rural and emerg market worldwide, where fiber or satellit is too expensive, and the spectrum is less cluttered. Airmax growth had stall in the past two year from it hyper-growth period a few year ago, yet still grew 15% year over year in the Septemb quarter.Ther are reason to think that 2017 could bring a reacceler for Airmax and it associ products. First, Ubiqu drop the ball somewhat when it initi releas Airmax AC, as these hyper-fast product were not backwards-compat with older Airmax M radios. That meant servic provid custom would have to refresh their entir network of radio in order to upgrade, as oppos to upgrad radio-by-radio. Thi wa fix in Decemb with the releas of new firmwar AirO 8.0, which wa no small task (it took over a year!). Second, Pera recent reveal sever new Airmax product for 2017, includ a GPON fiber product. While Ubiquiti' radio are normal use to replac fiber, Ubiqu found out that mani of it emerging-market custom can lay fiber along power line veri cheaply, and thi new product should add to their arsenals. Even more exciting, the compani reveal an entir new ASIC (application-specif integr chip) it ha develop call LTU. As Pera explained:""It' been well over 3 year in the making, and we'r go to launch it next year. And it' go to be essenti airFib multipoint. But it' go to be light-year ahead of anyth in the market, and at cost point relev to airMAX, we'r go to price it higher. The margin are go to be a lot better... we think that' go to be a realli big differenti in the market.""Again, we see Ubiqu make a move to grow out of it reput as just a low-cost vendor, and into a compani that sell higher-qu (and, therefore, higher-margin) product as well.AmplifiWhil Pera & Co. are at it, whi not enter a complet new custom segment? That' what Ubiqu did thi summer with the introduct of Amplifi, a consum router that will take onNetgear's(NASDAQ: NTGR) Orbi andGoogle's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) home router. Amplifi is gettingstellar reviewsso far, and just like Unifi' access points, it might pave the way for other ancillari product for the connect home.Even though the Amplifi wa unveil last summer, it hasn't produc much revenu for Ubiqu yet. Thi is not becaus the product wasn't great, but becaus the compani wa capacity-constrain for the last half of 2016. As Pera said:""What I'm really, really, realli frustrat about, is we didn't execut on the product side. So we had demand for ten of thousand of unit out of the gate, and we'v just been slow to get these out.""That is what I'd call have ""champagn problems."" And while Ubiqu is go up against strong competitor such as Google, Netgear, and others, the price-perform characterist of the product, as well as the secular tailwind of the connect home make me a believ that Amplifi could becom a meaning growth driver as earli as thi year.Th valuat is still reasonableEven after Ubiquiti' big move, the stock trade at a fairli reason 23 time trail earnings, which mean the market is price in decent, though not spectacular, growth from here. Still, with a disrupt busi model, a rock-solid balanc sheet, and a long runway in a secular growth industry, I think Ubiquiti' stock can exit 2017 a good deal higher than where it entered.Off from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

4 Stocks to Buy for Big February Dividend Hikes,2/6/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsToday, I want to talk to you about my favorit strategi for beat the market and build long-term wealth.makeArticleAd();If you'v been read my regular column onForbesand ContrarianOutlook.com, you probabl alreadi know what it is: buy dividend growth. (I'll name 4 individu stock that should be on your list now in just a moment.)Becausea I'v written before, stock that regularli hike their payout outperform ani other kind of compani over time. You can give yourself a bigger edg if you invest in compani that surpris the market with bigger-than-expect dividend hikes.TakeCisco Systems, Inc.(CSCO),which ""accelerated"" it quarterli payout last February: after three year of 2 cent per share- and 3 cent per share-a-year increases, Cisco ""went big,"" boost it dividend by 5 cent per share, or 23.8%.Manag declar the new dividend on Februari 10, 2016; if you'd bought the day before, you'd be up 37% right now:Big Payout Hike Ignit CSCOProblem is, Cisco' sale and earn are flatten out, and it payout ratio (or the percentag of earn paid out as dividends) is edg up near 50%.So even if it doe drop anoth outsiz hike on investor thi month, I don't expect that run to continue.Th Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for FebruaryBut that' not the case with the fourotherstock I'v got for you today.Sherwin-William Co (SHW): The Color of MoneySherwin-William Co(SHW)investor can count on a dividend hike in mid-February, when the paint maker typic announc it quarterli payout for the come year.Sherwin ha rais it dividend for 37 straight years, and it' unlik to break that streak now. Quit the contrary: in the last three years, the payout ha jump 18.8%, on average, and I expectat leastthat again thi month.Why? For one, the compani just report fourth-quart revenu and earn that blew past expectations. Manag will be keen to draw attent to that, and a fat dividend hike is a great way to do it.They have plenti of room: SHW' payout ratio is minuscule, even with the outsiz dividend rais it' been dish out:A Safe, Grow PayoutY might think Sherwin' upsid is cap by it seemingli high forward price-to-earn (P/E) ratio of 22.2, but that' still below it five-year averag of 22.5.And investor are right to expect growth: accord to the Lead Indic of Remodel Activity, US home-reno spend will jump 6.7% thi year. With 37% of the paint market-and like closer to 50% onc it close it merger with rivalTh Valspar Corp(VAL)-Sherwin' perfectli place to capitalize.Meantime, the all-but-guarante dividend hike will keep drive the stock price higher. Check out how SHW ha risen in lockstep with the payout:Dividend Doubles, SHW TriplesThi 151-year-old compani current offer a 1.1% forward dividend yield. The time to buy is now.Lear Corpor (LEA): A Dividend in OverdriveLear Corporation(LEA) may not get your blood pump on the current yield front - it pay just 0.85% - but itcertainlyshould when it come to dividend growth. In the past five years, the automot seat maker' payout ha more than doubled. As with Sherwin, that' help ignit the stock:Anoth Triple-DoubleLast February, Lear hand out a 20% dividend increase, and I see anoth double-digit hike come thi year, like mid-month.Sure, North American car sale have plateaued, but Lear get 60% of it revenu from outsid the continent, and it' forecast gain in all of it other regions.Car Sale Roll OnSource: Lear Corp.That will help drive Lear' revenu up to $19.5 billion, top the record $18.6 billion it post in 2016. And it' sit on a record order backlog, to boot.Th compani also ha a rel small number of locat (just 9% of it total) in Mexico, the countri that' taken the brunt of Presid Trump' ire lately. Meantime, Trump' tax and infrastructur propos could goos job and wage growth in the US-and send more American to their local dealership.Abov all, Lear is a free-cash-flow machine, crank out $1.1 billion worth in the last 12 months. It dividend account for a mere 7.1% of that-on of the lowest ratio I'v ever seen in a dividend stock.Finally, Lear is cheap, trade at just 9.0 time forward earnings. That, plu management' aggress buybacks, give you some ad downsid protection:A Buyback ChampNat Health Investor Inc (NHI): A Long-Term OutperformerN Health Investor Inc(NHI)i a real estat invest trust (REIT) that financ seniors' hous facil through mortgage, sale-leaseback, joint-ventur and other form of financing.Y won't find Sherwin- or Lear-styl double-digit payout growth here. What youwillfind is consistency: NHI' payout ha risen for 14 straight years, and those hike are still healthy, with the dividend grow at 7.7% annual over the past five years. Plus, the REIT set you up with an outsiz 4.9% forward dividend yield right off the bat.And if you bought NHI a decad ago, you'r no doubt happi today. On a total-return basis, the REIT ha crush the benchmarkSPDR S&P 500 ETF(SPY):Built for the Long HaulWhen it come to REITs, the key figur is fund from oper (FFO), not earnings. And a surg in FFO-a demand for the facil NHI financ march higher-ha been the drive forc behind both the soar share price and the payout growth.Surg FFO Launch NHI' DividendI fulli expect that to continue, thank to demographics: roughli 10,000 American turn 65 everi day, and that will fuel soar demand for senior care in the year ahead. NHI, with a presenc in 32 states, stand directli in the way of that trend.Investors, for their part, can look forward to Februari pay rais for year to come.10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsTh dividend current repres 73.2% of normal FFO, a veri manag level for a REIT. NHI is also attract price at just 13.3 time trailing-twelve-month normal FFO. Buy thi one and tuck it away for the next 20 years.Wyndham Worldwid Corpor (WYN): Anoth Yield-and-Growth PlayWyndham Worldwid Corporation(WYN)also offer an above-averag yield - 2.5% vs. 2.1%, on average, for theS&P 500- and strong dividend growth: in each of the past three Februarys, WYN ha deliv a fat 20% dividend hike. Can it keep up the pace?I wouldn't bet against the hotel chain, becaus the earn behind that payout growth keep arc higher:Th company' payout ratio ha also held steadi at just 28%, despit the fact that it' more than doubl it dividend sinc 2011.(Wyndham is the world' fifth-largest hotel chain by revenue, with more than 7,900 hotel and 112,000 vacation-rent properti worldwide.)Th hotel busi is competitive, but WYN' more than hold it own, thank in part to it popular loyalti program, which let custom rack up point fast, thank to the company' huge number of properties.Th Street see more strong earn growth ahead, with analyst forecast EP of $6.25 in 2017. That bode well for more big payout hikes. Plu WYN is cheap, trade at just 12.7 time thi year' EP forecast. Check into thi one now.A Scream BargainAl 4 of these stock are great buy now.

Forget Palo Alto Networks Inc: These 2 Stocks Are Better Buys,2/4/2017,"Imag source: Getty.Th good news for sharehold ofPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) is that the stock ha rebound follow a dismal 2016, jump 16% in January. The not-so-good news is that wild stock price fluctuat are par for the cours with Palo Alto. Now, after nearli two year of grow revenu more than 50%, Palo Alto is see it sale growth -- like that of mani of it peer -- slowli come back down to earth.makeArticleAd();Without the sky-high revenue, investor and some pundit are take a closer look at the rest of Palo Alto' financials, and what they see doesn't paint a pretti picture. However, there are data-secur provid that offer exposur to a market expect to soar in the come year and are financi sound, offer industri diversification, and carri less volatil than Palo Alto. Two that come to mind as better buy -- though for differ reason -- areCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) andCheck Point Software(NASDAQ: CHKP) .Imag source: Cisco.Secur and beyondData secur sale are fairli low on the list of revenu driver for Cisco today, but that' chang with each success quarter. Of it primari units, secur wa handili Cisco' fastest-grow busi last quarter, and don't be surpris to see more of the same when it announc fiscal 2017 second-quart result on Feb. 15.Cisco' secur sale account for $540 million of it $12.4 billion in total revenu last quarter, and that' alreadi more than Palo Alto and Check Point. Secur grew 11% compar with a year ago, and with Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins' strategi of shift to burgeon markets, includ cloud data center and the Internet of Things, data secur will becom increasingli important.That' one of the upsid to Cisco in the secur space. Becaus Cisco is also lead the charg in other fast-grow opportunities, it isn't overli reliant on one market. The introduct of Cisco' new ""Digit Build Switch"" that deliv ""smart"" function to build is one recent exampl of it divers offerings. And with a 3.4% dividend yield, Cisco is a much better buy than Palo Alto for growth and incom investors.Imag source: Check Point Software.Slow and steadyWhen Check Point share it fourth-quart result on Jan. 19, it stock jump about 7% and ha maintain those gain since. That may come as a surprise, given that it revenu climb onli 6%. Palo Alto disappoint last quarter, report a 34% sale improvement. Whi the differ response? The answer to that question is whi Check Point is a better buy, particularli for investor who prefer rel stability.Though Check Point' revenu grew 6%, it earn per share (EPS) climb 21% includ one-tim items. Palo Alto' EPS, despit it 34% increas in sale to $398.1 million, wa a loss of $0.69 a share, 47% wors than a year ago. Check Point' 26% increas in it low overhead, recur subscript revenu of $110 million, and CEO Gil Shwed' cost-manag effort translat to a strong bottom line.Check Point wa abl to report such stellar EP result becaus it total expens -- both cost of revenu and oper expens -- equal 50% of it $486.7 million in revenue. Palo Alto spent $50 million more than it total revenu in the quarter, which is whi EP continu to declin along with it sale growth.Stil a favoriteAnalyst aren't quit as enamor with Palo Alto as they were a few month ago, though the consensu price target is still $176.67, equal to nearli 20% appreci in the near term. One pundit suggest Palo Alto share will climb as high as $210.Neither Cisco nor Check Point ha earn analysts' good tidings, at least to the extent Palo Alto has. That said, Cisco' market diversification, it fast-grow secur sales, and an industry-lead dividend make it a hands-down better buy. And for a pure-play data-secur alternative, Check Point offer a few thing Palo Alto doesn't: increas profits; a focu on consistent, sustain growth; and rel stock price stability.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Microsoft's $1 Billion Cybersecurity Play Hurt Smaller Players?,2/1/2017,"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recent announc that it will invest over $1 billion per year on cybersecur research and development. That amount, which is equival to roughli 8% of it R&D spend over the past 12 months, doesn't includ ani acquisit that Microsoft might make. Let' see whi Microsoft is beef up it cybersecur efforts, and what that could mean for smaller player across the fragment industry.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();What cybersecur mean to MicrosoftMicrosoft' Window is the most wide use PC oper system in the world, Offic is the most popular product suite, and Azur is the second largest cloud platform in the world afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS. Much of thi massiv ecosystem ha tradit been protect by third parti companies. Microsoft' own product -- like Window Firewall, Window Defender, and Microsoft Secur Essenti -- were often consid inferior to third-parti ones.However, Microsoft' ecosystem ha becom more cohes under CEO Satya Nadella' ""One Windows"" strategy, which aim to instal the same OS and app store across multipl platforms. Sinc user would ideal download app from the Window Store and deliv their data to Cortana and Bing via Azure, it would be logic to add first-party, self-upd secur solut across the entir ecosystem. Microsoft claim that the number of weekli cyber attack ha risen from 20,000 to as mani as 700,000 over the past two to three years.To counter those threat while expand it ecosystem, Microsoft acquir three Isra cybersecur firm over the past two year -- enterpris secur start-up Aorato, cloud secur firm Adallom, and data protect firmSecur Islands. Those acquisit and it plan R&D invest could help Azur challeng AWS, which alreadi integr an arsen of secur featur into it cloud infrastructur platform. Azure' revenu surg 93% annual last quarter, but Microsoft hasn't reveal it exact sale figur yet.How thi could hurt smaller playersA Microsoft' cybersecur ecosystem grows, it could overlap with the servic of mani smaller stand-alon third-parti players. For example, Microsoft recent launch Window Defend ATP (Advanc Threat Protection) for Window 10. That endpoint servic match event with Microsoft' cloud-bas Secur Graph, which gather data across over a billion Window devic worldwide. It also work with Microsoft' email protect servic from Offic 365 and Microsoft Advanc Threat Analytics.Thi platform directli compet against ""perimeter"" player like threat prevent firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) and next-gen firewal vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) . Dure last year' RSA Conference, Microsoft princip research lead Tanmay Ganacharya toldDark Readingthat Window Defend ATP can ""help captur network traffic out of a given endpoint"", so that it could ""detect the same attacks"" as FireEy and other threat detect services.Consid what $1 billion mean to these smaller cybersecur companies. Palo Alto and FireEy are expect to respect gener $1.8 billion and $720 million in revenu thi year -- so there' no way that they could match Microsoft' R&D investments. Windows, Offic 365, Azure, Dynamics, and other platform all give Microsoft the abil to bundl and scale up it cybersecur servic veri quickly. It can also offer lower price and offset those loss across other part of it ecosystem.But ""best in breed"" cybersecur firm could still surviveMicrosoft' grow interest in the cybersecur market could render some smaller player obsolete, but ""best in breed"" player like FireEy and Palo Alto have surviv similar assault from bundl player before.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , for example, ha aggress bundl threat prevent and next-gen firewal into it network hardwar and software. Yet FireEy still serv 5,000 custom across 67 countries, which includ nearli half of the Forb Global 2000. Palo Alto serv over 35,500 custom in more than 140 countries, includ 80 of the Fortun 100 and half of the Global 2000.Those number indic that compani will like valu a company' track record and reput over the conveni of cheaper bundles. They also indic that it could be smarter for Microsoft to either acquir or partner with smaller stand-alon player instead of tri to render them obsolete.Th key takeawayBeef up it cybersecur busi will help Microsoft counter Amazon and tighten up it ""One Windows"" ecosystem. While some of the new featur seem destin to crush third-parti secur players, investor should rememb that compani will like stick with ""best in breed"" player instead of the cheapest bundle, and a mass switch to a new secur platform can be costli and time consuming.Therefore, investor in cybersecur compani should be mind of Microsoft' ambitions, but they should rememb that mani ""best in breed"" compani have weather similar attack from compani like Cisco before.10 stock we like better than MicrosoftWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

They expect earn of $1.69 per share thi year - plenti to cover the 98-cent annual dividend, which rose by a penni late last year.A I recent wrote, GE is a compani thatover-promis and under-delivers.It isn't go to fail, but it isn't go to boom, either.It may do well if oil boom again, but under Immelt, GE ha becom aWait for Godotstock … and in the play, Godot never show up.I own GE for most of thi decade, and enjoy a decent return, but I see a limit horizon for the oil and ga busi - higher price will just bring more supply, drive price back down again. Add to that the fact that renew energi supplies, especi efficiency, are increas and get cheaper.Yes, it make wind turbin and it' all over efficiency, but I'm not feel the return there.Sorry, Charlie.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February: #7, Cisco System (CSCO)Source: ShutterstockCSCO Dividend Yield:3.4%For one brief shine moment in the year 2000,Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) wa the world' most valuabl company. Their Internet switch and router connect the world, and the ceil for growth seem unlimited.Thi wa back when my kid were in grade school and I rock a red beard, with a fedora. Good times.Today, CSCO is a solid dividend stock. The 26-cent quarterli dividend yield 3.4%. It' a littl like me: a distinguish white-hair gentleman. If you bought it when it made that turn in 2011, at $15, it 6-cent payout ha more than quadrupled, and you have an annual yield of 6% on that investment. Cisco can afford the dividend, too, as it usual earn about twice it payout.But there is danger in the air.Hardwar is becom software. The function of a switch or a writer can be done by ani PC with port and the write software. The trend is call Softwar Defin Networking. Cisco is thu rush to becom a softwar company, buyingAppDynamicsfor $3.7 billion, becom a forc in comput security, and rais the percentag of revenu from softwar to 29%.Analyst are divid between those who tell peopl to buy Cisco, and those who just want you to hold it. I onc own thi stock, and I am not divided. I say avoid it. If you'r to buy into technology, you need to get in on the lead edge, and switch are no longer the lead edge.Technolog evolv rapidly. When a technolog compani ceas to be on that lead edge, it start to die. Thi can happen veri quickly, asNokia Corp. (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) discov with the debut of the iPhon 10 year ago. And there may be noth that can be done, as Novel learn when the internet replac it network system. Also, the industri seldom allow for second acts.Th 7 Best High-Yield Invest for RetirementI do not envi the job of Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, who succeed the legendari John Chamber in 2015. Sell ani kind of hardwar in a cloud-bas era is a veri difficult thing to do, and margin will remain compressed.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February: #6, Coca-Cola (KO)Source:Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)KO Dividend Yield:3.4%I admit to a bia on behalf ofTh Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO).I wa rais on Coke on Long Island. I never like Pepsi. (Pro tip: The secret ingredi is vanilla.)I move to Atlanta in 1981, and Coca-Cola built Atlanta. There is no other reason for a citi to be here, save the sugar water that Robert Woodruff took around the world. Woodruff convinc corpor to put region offic here, hi boyhood friend Bill Hartsfield (of the airport) help make the citi an island of rel peac dure the Civil Right era, and as ""Mr. Anonymous"" he contribut much of the civic infrastructure, like the Art Center and most of the Emori Univers campus, which drive Atlanta today.Oh, did you ever wonder whi Santa Clau wear a red coat?That' Coca-Cola red.I have own Coca-Cola stock in the past. I got out becaus it' just not grow - revenu are down 10% sinc 2012, and oper margin have been declining. Don't let anyon fool you about what they make, either. It' not so much sugar water as it is treat water. Mr. Woodruff said in 1923 to make everi Coca-Cola (we call it Co-Cola down here) tast like everi other Coca-Cola, no matter where you bought it, and that made the compani an earli leader in water treatment. If you don't trust the water on your travels, buy a Coke. It won't hurt you.That said, there may final be a reason to buy Coke stock again, and hi name is Jame Quincey.Quincey becom CEO on May 1and is alreadi credit with grow profit through smaller can and buy new brand likeJugo de Valle, a Mexican juic producer.Cok now ha 20 brand with over $1 billion in sales, includ Dasani water, Odwalla juic and Honest Tea. If you buy a can of hot coffe from a vend machin in Japan, it' probablyGeorgia, anoth Coke product.Coca-Cola deliv a steadi $10 billion in oper cash flow each year, and continu to cover it 35-cent quarterli dividend with earnings. A 10% price declin sinc April ha goos the yield a bit - and you want to buy a dividend stock when the price is down, like now, but when there is a littl bit of excit around it, like now.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February: #5,Boe (BA)Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrBA Dividend Yield:3.5%I am a former sharehold ofBo Co(NYSE:BA), have sold out last spring at about $130 per share.Thi wa a mistake, as Boe share are now worth $169 - one-third more than they were when I sold. Even at that price, however, the recent announc $1.42-per-shar dividend sport a yield of 3.5%. Boe deliv $10.5 billion in oper cash flow dure the fourth quarter, and forecast 2017 earn of $9.10 to $9.30 per share, mean that new dividend should be safe.Sinc order for new plane peak in 2014, Boe ha been focus on product and cost-cutting, move product from Puget Sound, where the compani is headquartered, to Charleston, South Carolina, which for now is not unionized.But aftera fail attemptto move product offshor earli in the decade, I question just how much more cost could be driven out of plane production, which is whi I foolishli sold.Bo is increas it deliveri of aircraft in 2017 and plan to get into the space busi in 2018. If it can pick up more militari contracts, the stock could be worth it current price, which ha reach analyst target and thu could be subject to profit-taking.If profit are taken and the price falls, however, jump in. Profit-tak will be limit by the increas dividend, whose yield put a floor under that price.In short, Boe truli is among the ""top"" Dow dividend stocks, in that it make more than enough to cover what it pay out, and it ha good enough prospect to be worth hold for year to come.Th 7 Best REIT to Buy for High Yield AND GrowthEverybodi goof at some point.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February: #4, Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)XOM Dividend Yield:3.6%No Dow stock wa as readi for Trump asExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), whose CEO Rex Tillerson is close to be confirm as Secretari of State.Exxon rose sharpli after the election, by more than 10% in about a month. But it ha sinc given up most of those gains, help expand it yield to 3.6%. The question is whether that dividend can be sustain into the future. Exxon hasn't brought in more than 75 cent per share in net incom sinc the end of 2015, and that wa not expect to changewhen it report earn on Jan. 31.The street' ""whisper number"" of 68 cent per share - what analyst are supposedli tell each other what to expect - is below the consensu earn estim of 72 cents.Th bull case for Exxon ha alway been base on it balanc sheet. The compani ha nearli $340 billion in assets, and the $46 billion in debt it had against those asset in Octob wa among the lowest figur in the industry. Tillerson manag Exxon Mobil conserv dure the oil bust, which turn out to be a wise move as oper cash flow deterior sharpli through the first quarter of 2016.Exxon Mobil is call an ""integr international"" oil company, with product asset around the world, along with refineries, tankers, and ga stations. Thi let it squeez out margin even when oil price were at their lowest, through refining, trade and run ga stations.Th compani is hedg it bet on intern growth, buy oil asset in Texas' Permian Basin for $5.6 billion up-front and as much asanoth $1 billion over the next few years. It' also hedg it bet on the climate, appoint environment scientist Dr. Susan Averi to it board of director - a move Tillerson would have been unlik to make and one that shock some Trump allies. The fact is XOM now ha alli in Washington to fight it polit battles, and it can expect good news on that front for some time to come.In the near-term, thi make Exxon Mobil stock a buy and, for incom investors, a bargain.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February: #3,Chevron (CVX)Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)CVX Dividend Yield:3.9%Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) is the anti-Exxon. More precisely, Chevron is everyth Exxon Mobil is accus of being, and a littl bit more.Chevron is a more aggress pollut - and a more aggress litig against pay for pollut - than Exxon Mobil. Chevron is also less commit to downstream retail, thu more depend on crude prices, than Exxon Mobil.CVX also is a bit more generous, with it dividend near 4% to current buyers. But should you be one?Personally, I don't think so. Chevron lost money for three of the last four quarters, make that dividend harder to justify. It debt-to-asset ratio ha been rise faster than Exxon Mobil's, and until the Septemb quarter, it oper cash flow had been fall steadily.Th are get wors for Chevron, even while they seem to be get better for Exxon Mobil. CVX miss badli on optimist estim for it Decemb quarter, with a profit of 22 cent per share on revenu of $31.5 billion. Analyst had been expect a 65-cent profit. That' not a miss … that' a mile.Bul expect Chevron to score big profit from a return to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. I do not.Go back to Q4 earnings, note that revenu did beat. But profit were down becaus profit from refin fell 65% year-over-year, to $357 million. If the Gulf doesn't yield big profits, if oil price don't stay high, or if there' an accident, that dividend - which wa hike a penni last fall to $1.08 per share - will be at seriou risk.Incom investor can't just look at yield. They need to look at earn as well. If earn don't match the dividend for long enough, and there' a dividend cut, you'r go to take some big losses.7 Straight-A Stock to Build Your Portfolio AroundI think the risk of that happen to Chevron is bigger than that happen to Exxon Mobil.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February: #2, Pfizer (PFE)Source:Kojach Via FlickrPF Dividend Yield:4.1%Pfiz Inc.(NYSE:PFE) is a great dividend stock as far as yield is concerned. But can you trust it?But can you trust it? Thi is not just a question of whether the compani can afford to pay sharehold out of earn (which Pfizer usual can't). It' also a question of whether the compani even want toruna a dividend company.In Novemb 2015, Pfizer said no to that. It announc a $160 billion deal to merg withAllergan plc(NYSE:AGN), which wa onli pay 5 cent per share in dividends, and to move it headquart to Ireland for tax purposes. The hope wa that the combin compani would deliv fat capit gain to shareholders. A chang in rule from the Treasuri Depart forc the two compani apart last April. If the deal were present today, it' like the new administr would approv it.What investor are get today is a compani whose profit margin have been fall steadili for years, as it biggest drug (like Lipitor) come off-patent, with a declin asset base, and with oper cash flow which, while improv lately, still repres less than 10 cent for each dollar of equity.Pfizer, in short, look like a veri lazi compani that may, or may not, pull a rabbit out of it hat and becom someth that it is not, which is a compani you buy for capit gains. The compani wa expect to earn 50 cent per share but report 47 cents.Th question remains, is Pfizer good for it dividend? Doe manag evenwantit to be a dividend stock? There are opportun in thi Dow dividend stock, but also risk - the kind an incom investor learn to avoid.Top 10 Dow Dividend Stock for February: #1, Verizon Commun (VZ)Source:Via FlickrVZ Dividend Yield:4.7%Th best yield among Dow dividend stocks, and one of the safest, is the 4.7% present paid to sharehold ofVerizon Commun Inc.(NYSE:VZ) - the former Babi Bell that ha emerg as one of two duopolist in the mobil and Internet backbon businesses.Verizon is the veri model of a stock you buy for income. It perform usual match that of the market, and the dividend is regular. The compani deliv 46 cent per share to sharehold at the bottom of the last recession, and now deliv almost 58 cents.Thi mean that when the stock becom oversold, as the trader say, which happen last Novemb and in Septemb 2015, and which some sayi happen right now, you buy. Then you hold and enjoy the yield.Th latest bargain time come on an earn miss announc Jan. 24. Trader may have been disappointed, but the $1.10 per share in incom still cover the dividend almost twice over, and Verizon remain commit to maintain the dividend. Verizon is a cash flow monster, deliv about $30 billion in oper cash flow each year. It busi model works.Verizon buy income-produc asset and then milk profit from them. That' whi it bought the rest of it mobil arm, Verizon Communications, payingVodafon Group PLC (ADR)(NASDAQ:VOD) $130 billion in 2014 and dramat hike it debt-to-asset ratio.

Cisco Gambles $3.7 Billion on Software,1/26/2017,"Imag source: Cisco Systems.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , the domin provid of enterpris switch and routers, is still predominantli a hardwar company. Just 29% of total revenu dure the latest quarter wa recurring, come from either softwar subscript or services.makeArticleAd();Th softwar business, which is spread across all of Cisco' report segments, is grow fast: defer revenu from recur softwar and subscript busi grew by 48% year over year to $3.8 billion dure the latest quarter. But hardwar is still the core of Cisco' business.Cisco ha manag to maintain it domin and it margin in the switch and rout busi despit major shift in the world of IT, like the emerg of cloud comput and software-defin networking. But neither busi is grow consistently. Softwar will be one of the key growth driver for Cisco go forward, and the compani hasn't been shi about make acquisit to push softwar revenu higher.A $3.7 billion bet on softwareOn Jan. 24, Cisco announc that it had agre to pay $3.7 billion in cash and assum equiti award for privat held AppDynamics, a provid of a cloud applic and business-monitor platform. AppDynam wa just one day away from go public, and Cisco paid a hefti premium to scoop up the compani at the last second. AppDynamics' last privat fundrais round yield a valuat of $1.9 billion, and the high-end of it IPO price rang repres a market capit of just $1.7 billion.""Appl have becom the lifeblood of a company' success,"" said Cisco SVP Rowan Trollope. Cisco believ that the acquisit will allow it to provid ""end to end visibl and intellig from the network through the application."" AppDynam will becom a new softwar busi unit within Cisco' Internet of Thing and applic business, with the deal expect to close dure Cisco' fiscal third quarter.Becaus AppDynam wa so close to go public, thi is a rare case where the financi of an acquir privat compani have been publicli disclosed. Cisco isn't get much revenu for it $3.7 billion investment. AppDynam ha produc $158 million of revenu through the nine month end Oct. 31, up about 55% year over year. Full-year revenu would be somewher around $230 million if that rate of growth holds. Cisco is pay roughli 16 time sales.AppDynam is also unprofitable, produc a net loss of $134 million dure the last fiscal year and $95 million through the nine month end Oct. 31. Big spend on sale and marketing, a common featur of fast-grow subscript softwar companies, is the main culprit. Oper expens are grow slower than revenue, a sign that thing are move in the right direction, but thi deal won't provid ani boost to Cisco' bottom line.Not a fan of thi dealA a Cisco shareholder, it' hard for me to get behind thi acquisition. Cisco' timing, race against the clock to close the deal, led to a price that wa more than twice the expect IPO price. Granted, the stock may have surg follow it now-cancel IPO. But thi doesn't seem like a compani that Cisconeededto own, price be damned.Cisco ha alway been acquisitive, but mani of it deal have been smaller, measur in the hundr of million of dollars. Bigger recent deal includ the $1.4 billion purchas of Jasper Technolog in earli 2016 and the $2.7 billion purchas of Sourcefir in 2013. The deal for AppDynam is bigger than both of those, and one of the largest Cisco ha made in years.To be fair, put Cisco' resourc behind AppDynam could turbocharg growth. But it will take an aw lot of growth to justifi the $3.7 billion price tag. I'm not convinc that thi deal is a good idea. If Cisco start make a habit of overpay for start-up valu in the billion of dollars, shell out more than a dozen time sales, I may have to reconsid my invest in the company.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Cisco Buys 45th Company In 5 Years, Revenues Still Stagnate",1/26/2017,"ByWolf Richter:Hav Cisco' Financi Engin Gone Nuts?Cisco (CSCO) is, let' say, in transition. It ha been in transit for years, from network hardware, such as switch and router where it' get batter by Chines competition, to softwar where it' get batter by… well you get the idea. The compani is in a veri competit environment. And it' tri to buy it way out of it.In it latest move, it announc that it would acquir AppDynam (APPD) - a ""perform manag and IT oper analyt company,"" as it say - for $3.7 billion, pluck it out from the IPO pipelin on the eve of it IPO.makeArticleAd();That' a huge premium over an alreadi rich IPO price. If banker had price the share at the top of the indic IPO range, the compani would have gone public at a valuat of $1.7 billion. Cisco paid over twice that.""Th fact that they were in their IPO process repres a window where we need to make a decision,"" Cisco' VP of Corpor Development, Rob Salvagno, toldReutersin an interview.AppDynam isn't huge - despit what that lofti price might indicate. And it isn't profit either. Accord to itsfilingwith the SEC, it had $158.4 million in revenu for the nine month through Octob 31, 2016, up 54% year-over-year. And it lost $95 million, up 3% year-over-year.So at that pace, AppDynam would have a littl over $200 million in revenu in the 12-month period. In other words, Cisco is pay 18 time those revenues.If revenu increas 50% a year, for four year straight, so by the end of 2020, the compani would have $1 billion in revenues, though revenu rare grow in a linear manner like thi - growth rate tend to slow down as a compani get larger. Nevertheless, if… by the end of 2020, it book $1 billion in revenues, Cisco would at that time still see a price tag of 3.7 time revenue.How much is that? Cisco had $49 billion in revenu in 2016 and a market capit of $153.6 billion. So it share trade at a rich 3.1 time revenues. Thi is go to be a long, long wait, if it isn't eternal, befor the AppDynam gambl pay off.But no matter. Cisco is an acquisit machine. And price doesn't matter. Revenu doesn't matter either, as we will see in a moment.Sinc 2012, Cisco ha acquired45 companies, from tini startup to not so small companies, mostli in software, includ comput security, data visualization, energi management, all manner of cloud softwar and services, mobil softwar and services, video, network softwar and services, and so on. For 26 of them, the term were not disclosed. So we don't know how much Cisco spent in total for these outfits.But for the 19 acquisit for which the term were disclosed, Cisco spent $18.2 billion!Despit all these acquisit and the fortun spent on them, Cisco' revenu haven't budg much over the past four years. Revenu in 2016, at $49.25 billion, were flat with 2015, and were up onli 1.3% sinc 2013:So Cisco ha spent well over $18 billion in five year on buy 45 companies, and revenu are stagnating?Oh, andbecauserevenu are stagnating, Cisco decid it had to cut costs. It blow billion of dollar on share buyback everi year, no problem. And it sink billion more everi year into overpr acquisitions, no problem. But it ha to cut ""costs,"" and so in August last year, it confirm rumor that it would tri to cut cost by about 15%, and to do that it would lay off 5,500 employees, or 7% of it global workforce.But no matter. Startup investor are dump their babi into Cisco' big lap - and thu into the lap of public and privat pension funds, stock portfolios, mutual fund and the like that all own Cisco shares. Those investor at the receiv end of Cisco' gener financi engin are love it. Without compani like Cisco, the whole system of unicorn would come tumbl down, as startup investor found their other exit larg blocked:in 2016, IPO had their worst year sinc 2003.APPDynam is base in San Francisco. It' part of the crazi boom, and it investor found their big-fat exit. The compani had a pre-IPO valuat of $1.9 billion. So even those investor that got in at the last fund round made a bundle. Other startup investor see that too. Becaus everyon is hope for those big-fat exits. And if IPO no longer open those doors, well, Cisco or IBM (IBM) or some other larg company, whose financi engin have gone nuts, might still be abl to.IBM is in trouble, and desper hype is appar required.

Here' how I describ thi powerhous technolog compani in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is gener classifi as a semiconductor design and developer, it solut serv telecom and enterpris network custom in the build-out of data center and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T(T),Cisco(CSCO), orAlphabet(GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surpris if they weren't.Thu about half of Broadcom' sale come from the Wire Infrastructur segment which ha been see steadi double-digit growth as these big custom transit to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approxim 30% of Broadcom' revenu come from it Wireless Commun divis which serv top-end mobil smart-devic maker likeAppl (AAPL)with radio frequenc (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technolog filters.

Do I Hear $300?So what ha chang in a month to make Broadcom the Bull of the Day again?Simpli this: the stock took off over 10% to new high in the past six session as a coupl of analyst bolster their view of thi must-own tech ""arm dealer.""

We think AVGO could achiev >$17.00 of EP by FY19 (prior $16) and the stock should work in an upsid scenario to $250+.""Oddly, the analyst did not rais hi exist price target from $200.So we'll leav that to a bolder fan of the company...On Januari 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenback rais hi price target on Broadcom to $240 from $210, and obvious reiter hi Overweight rating. Here' the MS view...""Increas our PT to $240 from $210 and highlight a bull case valuat of $300.

Ignore Palo Alto Networks Inc: Here Are 3 Better Stocks,1/25/2017,"Palo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) kick off the year with a bang, rise nearli 13% so far in January, nearli 4% sinc competitorCheck Point Software(NASDAQ: CHKP) report finish 2016 with anoth solid quarter. However, Palo Alto investor have seen thi movi before. Palo Alto stock wa fli high with it string of report 50% quarterli jump in revenu each quarter, which end earlier thi year.Now that sale growth ha slow to the low 30% range, and expect are for even less in the quarter that end at the end of thi month, the roller-coast ride that come with own share of Palo Alto will like continue. But there are a few data secur stock that offer upsid without as much risk, includ one ideal for growth and incom investors. Let' take a look.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Check Point Software.Check Point: Similar, but differentOn reason Check Point stock is bump up against it 52-week high is that CEO Gil Shwed' strategi of grow subscript sale -- a sourc of recur revenu -- have been an unmitig success. Check Point increas sale 6% year over year to $487 million last quarter, but it subscript revenu soar 26% to $110 million.A year ago, subscript equal 19% of total revenue; now that figur is 23% and climbing. Not onli do recur sale give Check Point a rel solid revenu foundation, the shift is also in line with Shwed' focu on manag expenses. Recur revenu cost less to gener over time than new sales, which is one reason Check Point offer less risk than it peer.Expens manag help set Check Point apart from Palo Alto. It help drive a 21% jump in Check Point' earn per share (EPS) last quarter. Check Point' total oper expens equal 50% of revenu last quarter, which ha gener been the case. And Palo Alto? Includ the cost of revenue, as is the case with Check Point' expenses-to-sal results, Palo Alto' overhead wa approxim $50 million more than it gener in revenue.Imag source: Cisco.Cisco: Bigger and betterLast quarter,Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) report $540 million in secur sales, good for an 11% improv year over year. In addit to Cisco' in-hous data secur solutions, it $71 billion in cash and equival allow it to continu ad to it product suite, as it did last quarter with the close of it $293 million deal for CloudLock.Similar to Check Point and, to a lesser extent, Palo Alto, Cisco ha adopt a subscription-bas model. CFO Kelli Kramer in a Novemb press releas point to Cisco' subscript and softwar offer ""a we transit our busi to a more recur revenu model"" as a key to it 3% EP growth year over year, after one-tim charges. Not bad consid Cisco grew total sale -- after exclud it now divest SP Video unit -- by 1% to $12.4 billion.Anoth reason Cisco warrant inclus on a list of stock that are better than Palo Alto is the divers of it business. Cisco ha long been a leader in switch and routers, but it continu to add software, cloud data center, and Internet of Thing (IoT) solut to it arsenal, along with security. In addit to it rel stabil and product diversification, Cisco' nearli 3.5% dividend yield also make it an ideal growth and incom alternative. Palo Alto doe not pay a dividend.Imag source: Fortinet.Fortinet: Consist profitableTh closest to Palo Alto among these three stock isFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) in that it ha also enjoy soar total revenue. Like Palo Alto, Fortinet' 22% increas in sale to $316.6 million in the third quarter wa down after a string of even stronger quarters. Howev Fortinet, like Check Point and Cisco, doesn't spend more than it gener and it profit translat to slightli less risk than Palo Alto with it mount losses..Though not in Check Point' rang of 50%, or even Cisco' 76%, Fortinet' combin cost of revenu and oper expens equal 98% of total sales. A rather sizabl jump in sale and marketing-rel overhead play a big role in Fortinet' cost last quarter, and it like will again when it announc earn on Jan. 26.However, Fortinet is consist profitable, and while not grow it top line as it had been, the 32% increas in defer revenu of $934.8 million last quarter bode well for the future.Th reliabl of Check Point, Cisco' market strength and dividend, and the consist profit of Fortinet while grow revenu 20% or more each quarter make each one a better stock than Palo Alto.10 stock we like better than Palo Alto NetworksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years",1/20/2017,"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump ha been sworn in as the 45th presid of the Unit States. The President-elect, who pledg to “Make America great again,” promis plenti of thing he would do regard hi first day in office. From repeal and replac Obamacar to renegoti NAFTA and begin the construct of the wall on the Mexican border.W won’t know for certain which of Trump’ polici will take prioriti or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on hi promis to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he need busi to lead, innov and hire workers. For that to happen, busi leader need to know their govern is on their side. To that end, here are some name to own for the next four year (at least) as Trump’ polici take shape.makeArticleAd();Low Corpor TaxesTrump’ promis to lower corpor tax can have a boost effect on the tech sector, which ha an estim $1.4 trillion stash in oversea tax havens. These includ some America' largest corpor such as Appl (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not onli ha Trump promis to lower the busi tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledg to elimin the corpor altern minimum tax.Beyond lower the tax rate, it would hardli shock anyon if Trump — given hi pro-busi stanc — were to enact a tax holiday at some point dure hi presidency. Compani like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capit Tesla (TSLA) can acceler the build of it Gigafactory, help it achiev not onli higher profit margins, but also higher vehicl production. In the process, Tesla would ignit the state of Nevada as an innov hub, while mass-produc produc emission-fre vehicl at afford prices.“Rep and Replace”Th Afford Care Act, a.k.a Obamacar wa design to — among other thing — “insur the un-insurable.” Notably, to provid insur coverag to peopl with pre-exist condit who were block under the then-exist rules. Depend on what side of the aisl you’r on, Obamacar either did it job or wa a “complet disaster,” accord to Trump. Still, whether Obamacar is entir dismantl or part of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth ha work aggress to exit the Afford Care exchanges, which reduc it exposur to ani chang Trump might make. What’ more, ad from be the nation' largest health insurer, UnitedHealth own Optum, which provid pharmaci benefit manag services. Last week, not onli did the compani beat top- and bottom-lin estimates, UnitedHealth rais it fiscal 2017 financi outlook, suggest it is readi for whatev Trump decid to do.Not everi compani will be as lucky. Conversely, compani such HCA Hold (HCA) and Univers Health Servic (UHS) that prosper under Obamacar may suffer. As will govern health care provid such as Centen Corpor (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).Scal Back Dodd-FrankCut down strict regul impos on financi institut ha been anoth polici Trump ha proposed. After all, how can he achiev econom growth and strengthen small busi if bank aren't lend money — someth bank collect struggl to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenc by the strong earn result releas so far from the like of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sach (GS), financi are onc again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consum protect and creat tougher rule on excess risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act ha been cite by bank execut as a prohibit of growth. ""There' mani aspect of it that we'v got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump' pick for Treasuri secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, call Dodd-Frank ""the number one prioriti on the regulatori side.”To that end, I would be surpris if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in hi first 100 day in office. Combin with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower tax it’ tough to ignor the potenti upsid a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’ not just the big bank that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super region like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financi (PNC), which Trump ha made great again."

The 6 Biggest Risks to Twilio Inc. Stock,1/17/2017,"Twilio(NYSE: TWLO) ha taken investor on a gut-churn roller-coast ride sinc it IPO last June. The company, which integr call and SM messag into app with a cloud platform, saw it share surg from an IPO price of $15 to nearli $70 befor pull back to the high $20 on concernsabout it valuation.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();But is Twilio now a worthi rebound play after that rout? Let' take a closer look at the six biggest risk face the compani (a outlin in it SEC filings) to find out.1. It depend on FacebookTwilio is heavili depend onFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) . Facebook' WhatsApp gener 10% of Twilio' revenu in the first nine month of fiscal 2016. That repres a declin from 17% in 2015, but Facebook recent ad Twilio' servic to Messenger, which should increas it weight on Twilio' top line again.To make matter worse, Facebook is a ""Variabl Custom Account"" which ha ""never enter into 12-month minimum revenu contract with Twilio."" Thi mean that Facebook can drop Twilio' servic at ani time, and it isn't oblig to pay Twilio a certain amount of guarante revenue.2. It depend on AmazonTwilio' cloud infrastructur is outsourc toAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AW (Amazon Web Services). Thi mean that an outag at AWS, which happen sever time in recent years, would knock all of Twilio' in-app phone and SM servic offlin -- which would be devast for top custom like WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb.Amazon could also emerg as a potenti rival to Twilio if it develop similar call and messag process servic for AWS. AWS' superior scale would then enabl it to offer those servic at lower price and render Twilio obsolete. But Amazon wa an earli investor in Twilio, and it use it platform to deliv SM messag for AW -- so compet against Twilio would be counterproductive.3. It depend on network servic providersA a middleman between network servic provid and mobil apps, Twilio is highli vulner to servic provid hike their prices. Twilio admit in it latest 10-Q file that ""the fee that we are charg by network servic provid may chang daili or weekly, while we do not typic chang our customers' price as rapidly.""Twilio also warn that ""mani of these network servic provid do not have long-term commit contract with us, and may termin their agreement with us without notic or restriction."" Thi mean that if the carrier decid to launch their own cloud platform for integr call and SM messag with apps, they could cut Twilio out of the loop and gut it core business.4. Potenti competit from CiscoTwilio also admit that legaci on-premis network equip vendor likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) could bundl Twilio-lik servic into their network hardwar bundl for servic providers. Do so could strengthen Cisco' servic provid revenue, which dip 2% annual last quarter.Integr more cloud-bas servic would widen Cisco' moat against rival in the software-defin network market while pivot it core busi away from itsslower-growthrout and switch -- but it could be devast for Twilio.5. It depend on growth abroadTwilio gener 15% of it revenu from intern market in the first nine month of 2016. That' up from 14% in 2015 and 12% in 2014. Therefore, Twilio note that it' been expand it oversea sale team, but that it experi in sell product in non-U.S. market wa ""limited.""Twilio also warn that the no-stack, developer-first model that gener such explos growth in the U.S. might not gain ""the same traction outsid the Unit States."" Moreover, carrier might not be as agreeable, similar platform might emerg in differ countries, and develop might prefer to develop their own call and SM integr servic from scratch. A consist strong dollar could also gobbl up the company' profit abroad.6. It lack of profitabilityTwilio is still unprofit by both GAAP (gener accept account principles) and non-GAAP (adjusted) metrics, and will like remain so for the forese future. The company' expens will like rise as it spend on sale team to acquir new custom and expand oversea goe up, and margin could be pressur by competit from bigger rivals. Thi mean that Twilio' cash posit will keep declin -- which could lead to yet anoth share-dilut stock offering.Th key takeawayI person own a small posit in Twilio, but I believ that it will remain volatil thi year due to the aforement risks. However, if investor are will to ride out that volatil and Twilio maintain it ""best in breed"" reput in call and SM integration, they could be well reward over the next few years.10 stock we like better than Twilio Inc.When invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit,1/13/2017,"With interest rate set to rise thi year, mani dividend investor are like worri that their stock will slip as bond yield becom more attractive. While somedividend stockswillinevit decline, investor can still find some low-risk incom play that have high yield and cheap valuations. Let' take a look at three such stock --AT&T(NYSE: T) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andReynold American(NYSE: RAI) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();TheDividend Aristocrat: AT&TAT&T' forward yield of 4.8% is much higher than the S&P 500' 2.1% yield, and it' comfort support by a payout ratio of 81%. It spent 72% of it free cash flow over the past 12 month on dividends. AT&T ha hike it dividend annual for over three decades, surpass the 25-year threshold for becom a Dividend Aristocrat.In addit to be a rock-solid incom play, AT&T is becom a growth play again with it acquisit of DirecTV and propos takeov ofTim Warner. Bundl it pay TV, wireless, and broadband internet servic togeth give the telco gianttremend leveragein deliv media content across multipl platform -- especi if it exclud that content from data charg across it own networks.Analyst expect AT&T' revenu and earn to rise 12% and 5%, respectively, thi year. The stock alreadi ralli 22% over the past 12 months, but it remain surprisingli cheap at 17 time earn -- which is much lower than it industri averag of 25.The matur tech stock: Cisco SystemsCisco System is often describ as a slow-growth, ""mature"" tech stock. Analyst expect the network giant' revenu to fall 2% and it earn to rise less than 1% thi year due to tough competit in router and switches, slower enterpris spending, and thedisrupt threatof cloud-bas network solut that requir less hardware.Du to those challenges, Cisco trade at just 15 time earnings, which is much lower than it industri averag of 25. It forward yield of 3.5% is also much higher than the market average, and it' easili support by a payout ratio of 47%. It spent 40% of it FCF on those dividend over the past 12 months. Cisco ha hike it dividend everi year sinc it start pay one in 2011.Cisco ralli more than 20% over the past 12 months, but those gain can mainli be attribut to the popular of dividend stock in a low-interest-r environ instead of ani real enthusiasm for it core business. But look ahead, Cisco might rekindl it top-lin growth with the robust growth of it cybersecur business, the growth of it newli acquir Jasper Internet of Thing (IoT) platform, and addit acquisitions.Th overlook tobacco play: Reynold AmericanTobacco stock are often consid solid incom investments, but some investor onli focu on the two former halv of the Philip Morri empir --AltriaandPhilip Morri International. Altria is a good domest play, but it price-to-earn ratio (P/E) of 25 is higher than the industri averag of 22. Meanwhile, PMI' all-oversea busi is too expos to the strong dollar.A better play is Reynold American, which becam the second-largest domest cigarett maker after it acquir Lorillard last year. Reynold trade at just 15 time earn and gener most of it revenu in the Unit States. Reynolds' flagship Camel brand counter Altria' Marlboro. The compani also domin the menthol market with Newport, lead the e-cigarett market with Vuse, and control the ""additive-free"" nich with Natur American Spirit.Reynold pay a forward yield of 3.3%, which is support by a payout ratio of 44%. It dividend payment have eclips it free cash flow (FCF) over the past year due to the Lorillard acquisition, but that payout ratio should drop to manag level as it FCF grow again. Reynold ha rais it dividend annual for seven straight years.Analyst expect Reynold to post 4% sale growth and 11% earn growth next year -- which top Altria' project sale growth of 2% and earn growth of 10%. Reynold could eventu be hurt by declin smoke rates, but it can like rais prices, cut costs, and repurchas stock to boost it earn for year to come.Th bottom lineThere' no perfect dividend stock that can be bought and forgotten about, but AT&T, Cisco, and Reynold American won't caus you to lose much sleep.

But at the same time, there are plenti of reason to skip thi biggest of the big oil companies, particularli if you'r look for a solid sourc of income. We reach out to five of our top contributor and ask them to write about some compani with bigger dividend than ExxonMobil.They gave us compel reason to consid oil and ga logist specialistHolli Energi Partner L.P.(NYSE: HEP) , tech stalwartCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) , telecom and media giantVerizon Commun Inc.(NYSE: VZ) , pharma blue chipPfiz Inc.(NYSE: PFE) , and healthcar real estat upstartCaretrust REIT Inc.(NASDAQ: CTRE) . Keep read to find out which of these compani would make a great addit to your dividend stock portfolio.makeArticleAd();Littl company, big dividendTyl Crowe(Holli Energi Partners): One thing dividend investor want from an invest in ExxonMobil is stabil with modest growth. For decad ExxonMobil ha been abl to deliv that, even through some of the biggest time of crisi for the oil and ga industry. It' one thing to recommend a compani that ha a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It' an entir other thing to find one that can deliv a dividend that ha the abil to weather ani storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth.Imag source: Getti Images.On that ha develop a decent reput for do just that over the year is oil and ga logist specialist Holli Energi Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of mani other transport and logist companies, it make up for it with it contract structur and management' prudent approach to growth. All of the servic the compani provid are done on 100% fee-bas contract with strong minimum volum commit from it customers. In do so, it take out almost all of the commod price risk associ with the oil and ga industry. Also it modest growth profil is done in a way to maintain a manag debt level and continu to deliv payout increases. The most recent distribut increas mark the 48th consecut quarter in which manag rais it payout.With it distribut yield of 7.1% and a histori of rais it payout in a sustainable, consist manner, investor look for a littl more yield than share of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holli Energi Partners.A domin tech companyTim Green(Cisco Systems): Network hardwar giant Cisco System ha been increas it dividend at an impress pace over the past few years. Cisco' quarterli dividend ha more than tripl sinc mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%.Cisco' long-term growth includ industri users, not just tradit tech applications.Cisco domin it core switch and rout markets, although growth ha been elus in recent years. The compani ha been invest in growth busi such as secur and collaboration, but broad weak dure Cisco' most recent quarter and lacklust guidanc suggest that a return to growth may take a while.Th good news for dividend investor is that Cisco gener a tremend amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion dure fiscal 2016, put the payout ratio base on thi number at about 42.5%. That leav plenti of room to grow the dividend even without much earn growth. Investor shouldn't expect Cisco' rapid dividend growth of the past few year to continu unless earn pick up. But a solid yield and the potenti for modest dividend growth go forward make Cisco a good choic for dividend investors.A low-risk telecom giantStev Symington(Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that' been rais everi year for the past decade,Verizon stockoff an attract mix between stabil and growth potential.Of course, there' no deni Verizon ha had a hard time find growth, given it increasingli competit core markets. Exclud 2015 contribut of it since-divest landlin business, revenu and adjust net incom per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boast except custom loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarter -- a testament to it continu invest in it market-lead network. And that leadership should onli becom more pronounc after it fulfil it promis to be the first compani to launch a 5G fix wireless broadband network in the Unit States.Imag source: Getti Images.Meanwhile, Verizon' Fio fiber-opt servic are enjoy renew growth, with FiO revenu up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thank to the addit of 90,000 FiO internet connect and 36,000 FiO Video connections.Verizon ha also made a number of acquisit to posit itself for longer-term growth, includ it purchas of connect vehicl solut compani Telog and an agreement to acquir Yahoo! last July, the acquisit of smart-citi solut compani Sensiti System in September, and it acquisit of fleet and mobil workforc manag compani Fleetmat complet in November. The fruit of these purchas will take time to realize, but collect they should serv to onli expand the scope and power of Verizon' busi over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon' juici dividend and compound return to do their work.Thi drugmak is a great way to gain exposur to the high-fli pharma spaceGeorg Budwell(Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offer a slightli richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real differ between these two income-gener stock is arguabl the tailwind face their respect industries.Imag source: Getti Images.Th pharmaceut industry, after all, is experienc a golden era stem from an uptick in innovation, an age and rapidli expand global population, and broader access to modern healthcar around the world.

There' the drastic slowdown in sales, the abrupt departur of the CEO last year and, of course, the intens competit environment. Not the least of which is FireEye' meander transit to the cloud and it hesit to adopt next-gener technologies.In light of all this, is it ani wonder that FEY stock ha been so terrible? Nope.But when it come to investing, there are often nice opportun with contrarian plays. So might thi be the case with FireEy stock? Well, to see, let' take a look at three pro and three cons:FEY Stock ProsStil a Solid Company:It doe seem overblown that FEY stock is head for near oblivion. The fact is that the compani still ha an impress business, with a wide array of product and services. In the latest quarter, FEY added287 new customersand there were 47 that enter into transact in excess of $1 million. The total custom account is over 5,000 and more than 940 are on the Forb Global 2000. As for revenues, they came to $186.4 million in the most recent quarter. In all, there is $926.2 million in the bank. Consid that the market cap of FEY stock is onli about $2.2 billion.Strong Leadership:CEO Kevin Mandia ha wast littl time in make seriou restructur efforts. Then again, he is one of the top influenc in the cybersecur industry. Hestart hi career in the Unit State Air Forcea a secur offic and then as a cybercrim investig in the Air Forc Offic of Special Investigation. After these stints, he went into the privat sector, have work at variou firm like Sytex, and also co-author two well-regard books. Then he went on to launch Mandiant in 2004, eventuallysel the compani to FireEyein 2014.10 Stock to Buy for Donald Trump' Second WindIn other words, Mandia ha a rare blend of deep experi with the technic aspect of cybersecur and also how to build success companies. So regard the product line, a key part of hi strategi is to offer more afford solut so as to cater to smaller customers. To thi end, FEY ha launch FireEy Essentials. But, of course, anoth high prioriti is the cloud, which is part of the FireEy as a Servic (FaaS) platform. Some of the recent product launch for thi includ Cloud MVX - which doe not requir a hardwar applianc and is price on a subscript basi - and MVX Smart Grid (thi is for those compani that prefer on-premis approaches, such as in industri like financi servic and healthcare).Then there are other import tool like the FireEy Secur Orchestrator, which manag threat and respons across massiv organizations. As a testament to it power, a govern agenc made a seven-figur purchas of the softwar dure thelatest quarter.Secular Trends:Mor than ever, we reli on core technolog that are becom essenti to everyday living. No doubt, there is the ubiqu of smartphon and wearables. But with the Internet of Things, there is the growth in technolog for autos, home and even medic devices. Protect these system from cyberattack is onli get more complicated. As a result, the growth for the industri is like to remain strong for the long haul. Accord to a report fromIDC, the global spend is expect to jump from $73.7 billion in 2016 to $101.6 billion by 2020.FEY Stock ConsGrowth Issues:Th deceler of the top line ha certainli been dramatic. Dure the first quarter of 2015, revenu soar by69% to $125.4 million. Yet for the latest earn report, there wa onli a 13% gain. Keep in mind that FEY expect the situat to get even worse. The guidanc for the fourth quarter is for revenu of $187 million to $193 million, which would translat to an increas of1.2% to 4.4%. It' import to note that a big part of the reduct ha come from the transit to a subscript busi model, which mean not as much revenu can be recogn up front. Despit this, there is littl doubt that FEY ha been lose momentum. That' whi the compani ha focus on restructur it operations.Competition:It' intens for the cybersecur market. Just some of the top oper includeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW),Check Point Softwar Technolog Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP) andProofpoint Inc(NASDAQ:PFPT). But some mega tech compani have also move aggress into the space, such asCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO). But perhap the biggest threat is from the startups, which have the benefit of a flush ventur capit market. The fact is that a technolog lead can easili disappear - and it can be veri tough to regain it. A prime exampl of thi isSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC), which reli too long on it antiviru franchis and did not make enough invest to refresh it product offering.Losses:FEY ha been a consist money loser. True, thi is fairli common throughout the cybersecur industry. But then again, loss becom much more of a problem when sale are rapidli falling! Unfortunately, there are no sign that FEY will hit profit anytim soon. For the current quarter, analyst expect a net loss of 16 cent a share. The compani ha made progress with reduc costs, yet asInvestorPlac Media'sJam Brumelynot recently: ""… an even closer inspect reveal that rel improv almost entir came from the $10.7 million reduct in R&D spend - a cost cut that may come back to haunt the compani in the long run.""Bottom Line on FEY StockTech turnaround are alway difficult, and mani fail. But again, FEY ha a CEO with a strong background and is make smart decisions. Actually, the compani is alreadi start to see posit results.FireEy Inc (FEYE) Stock Hit A Bottom ... But Not THE BottomBesides, the valuat is fairli reasonable. Consid that FEY stock trade at about three time it sales. By comparison, both PANW andCyberark Softwar Ltd(NASDAQ:CYBR) sport multipl of about eight time sales.OK then, should you buy FEY stock now?

Will Cisco Systems Raise Its Dividend in 2017?,1/11/2017,"Technolog stock use to be stingi with their capital, butCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) is proof of how much the tech industri ha chang when it come to dividends. Cisco paid it first dividend just six year ago, but sinc then, it ha grown it quarterli payment so much that the network giant is now among the top dividend pay stock in theDow Jone Industrialsin term of yield. Look forward, incom investor want to know if they can count on Cisco to continu it streak of reward sharehold with higher dividends. Let' take a closer look at Cisco System to see whether it will rais it dividend in 2017.Imag source: Cisco Systems.Dividend stat on Cisco SystemsCurr Quarterli Dividend Per SharemakeArticleAd();$0.26Curr Yield3.4%Numb of Consecut Year With Dividend Increases6 yearsPayout Ratio47%Last IncreaseApril 2016Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Last increas refer to ex-dividend date.How Cisco becam a dividend giantCisco' histori of pay dividend is short but sweet. In 2011, the network giant declar a $0.06-per-shar quarterli dividend. Then-CFO Frank Calderoni told investors, ""Cisco' leadership posit in the market we serv is strong, and the time is right for Cisco to pay our first-ev cash dividend."" The payout gave Cisco a modest dividend yield at the time of 1.4%.Yet Cisco wasn't content for veri long with simpli pay a dividend. The follow year, the compani gave investor a 33% increas in April, and then came back with a whop 75% boost in October. The second increas wa part of Cisco' broader capit manag strategy, which state the company' intent to return half of it free cash flow to sharehold in the form of dividend and stock repurchas combined. Moreover, then-CEO John Chamber said, ""We want to get the dividend to allow both that the sharehold clearli understood we'r commit to it, and if we do our job right, at the right times, we'r commit to rais it.""CSCO dividenddata byYCharts.Sinc then, Cisco ha follow through on it commit to make the dividend an increasingli import part of it total return for shareholders. Three double-digit percentag dividend hike follow in consecut years, and the most recent increas came to 24%. Current CEO Chuck Robbin told investor after that boost, ""We have a tremend amount of confid in our busi long term, [and] we heard from mani of our sharehold that they want to see us get more aggress with the dividend returns.""Yet even with the big increas in dividends, Cisco hasn't overextend itself. Dividend payout make up just over half of Cisco' earn right now. If the compani can sustain it growth rate go forward, then there should be more opportun for the network giant to make further increases.Wil Cisco rais it dividend in 2017?One outstand issu that could spur anoth increas in Cisco' capit return to sharehold is whether tax reform will reduc the amount of tax that the tech giant would have to pay to repatri profit from overseas. As Robbin told investor in December, ""If we'r abl to bring those fund back to the U.S., then we would look at a combin of the option of dividends, buybacks, and M&A activity.""Yet it wouldn't take favor movement on repatri to allow Cisco to make a further increase. Stock buyback have reduc Cisco' share count over the years, and that permit the compani to make dividend increas without boost the total amount of cash it' pay to shareholders.Overall, the odd are good that Cisco will rais it dividend in 2017. There' a chanc that the compani could wait until later in the year than it usual March-April time frame in order to give lawmak time to consid a tax reform packag that could includ repatri provisions. However, what' more like is that investor will get a roughli 12% increas to $0.29 per share earli in the year, with a possibl further increas if thing in Washington go well. Regardless, Cisco' total return of nearli 25% over the past year ha kept long-term sharehold happy, and it growth prospect remain solid, offer futur support for futur dividend increas in 2017 and beyond.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Though the compani hasn't report it Q4 earn yet, as of Q3, the compani report that it had exceed it target, gener free cash flow at a gold price below $1,000 per ounce.Barrick' skill at keep it expens down wa partli respons for thi success. The mine industry' version of oper expens -- all-in sustain cost (AISC) -- provid good insight into how effici a compani is operating. And in thi regard, Barrick wa quit successful.A of Q3, manag estim that AISC for fiscal 2016 will total between $740 and $775 per gold ounce. By comparison,NewmontMining(NYSE: NEM) , one of Barrick' lead competitors, ha a fiscal 2016 AISC estim of $870 to $930 per gold ounce.Becaus dig the yellow stuff out of the ground doesn't come cheaply, mine compani often reli on debt to keep the shovel shoveling. Consequently, a compani carri a heavi debt load can quickli find itself in troubl if the price of gold fall too far.Barrick Gold' management, which is sensit to this, ha commit to a medium-term debt-reduct strategi of lower it total debt by $5 billion from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2017. Barrick reduc debt by $3 billion in 2015, which led to a debt-reduct target of $2 billion in 2016. And as of Q3, it had achiev 71% of that target. Moreover, on the Q3 confer call, manag report that it wa ""track well"" to the yearli target.Growth catalyst in 2017Turn toward the new year, we don't find ani singular event that will affect the company' performance. One initi that will be worth following, however, is the company' work withCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) . John L. Thornton, Barrick' execut chairman, recogn the partnership ha tremend potential.In the press release, he states, ""Har the potenti of digit technolog will unlock valu across our business, help us grow our free cash flow per share."" And in 2017, the two compani will work to develop Barrick' Cortez mine -- one of Barrick' core mine in Nevada -- into Barrick' ""flagship digit operation."" Though progress at Cortez will not have a profound effect in 2017, it will be an auspici sign that further success await as other mine are digit -- success that will, in time, result in larger financi gains.Besid monitor progress with Cisco, investor can watch for Barrick' success in achiev it financi targets. Arguably, the strong perform of Barrick' stock wa a result of the company' strong perform in strengthen both it balanc sheet and cash flow.Imag source: Barrick Gold.A a result, continu success in shore up the balanc sheet and improv cash flow may translat to a rise in shares. For example, in it Investor Day present from February, manag forecast gold product to total between 5.0 million and 5.5 million ounc of gold. In addition, manag estim AISC to total between $740 and $790 per gold ounce.A golden valuation?We'v look at what' behind Barrick and what' ahead, so let' turn our attent now to it stock. Sinc the compani hasn't report posit net incom sinc 2011, the tradit price-to-earn ratio won't provid much insight. Instead, let' consid the stock in term of it free cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis.Ov the past year, the stock ha trade as low as 8.5 time free cash flow and as high as 17.0 time free cash flow. Currently, share are trade at about 13 time free cash flow -- almost exactli the midpoint of it rang over the past year. Thi suggest that share are reason priced.Consid onli one valuat metric seem inadequ to properli gaug the stock, so let' also look at it' price-to-sal ratio on a trailing-12-month basis. Trade at about 2.3 time sales, share seem to be a littl bit higher than the midpoint of it high and low for the year -- but not by much.ABX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYCharts.To provid more context for the stock' valuation, let' consid it alongsid it peers:Goldcorp,Kinross Gold, Newmont Mining, andYamana Gold. In term of free cash flow, Barrick' valuat certainli seem fair. Although it may seem a littl pricier than it peers, the stock' valuat in term of sale doesn't rais ani red flags.ABX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYCharts.Overall, consid where share are trade today, the stock seem fairli priced.Th takeawayAlthough share of Barrick Gold had a great run in 2016, there' no guarante that it will continu into 2017. At thi point, in fact, it seem that Wall Street ha gotten thi one right by not bake in too mani expectations, or punish it unfairly. With it eye on the futur -- a digit futur -- and a circumspect approach to manag it debt, Barrick Gold is a reason consider for investor look to gain exposur to the gold industry.10 stock we like better than Barrick GoldWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Total softwar revenu isgrow again, and cognit comput system Watson will be used, both directli and indirectly, by more than 1 billion consum by the end of 2017.IBM expect to produc at least $13.50 in adjust earn per share in 2016, which is depress becaus of it heavi invest and the continu neg impact of currency. IBM will need to eventu return to earn growth for my invest to reach it full potential, but I'm confid that thecompany' strategyi the right one.Anoth big tech companyI'v own share of network hardwar giant Cisco sinc mid-2012, origin pay $16.61 per share. I ad to that posit a coupl of times, includ in earli 2016, when the stock market had a brief but lucr meltdown. My cost basi current sit at $20.40 per share.Th stock ha surg to around $30 per share sinc then, driven mostli by the fact that the market wa extrem pessimist about Cisco a few year ago. The company' result have been fine but noth to write home about. Growth ha been slow, and it core switch and rout busi have been volatile. But Cisco continu to domin those markets.CSCOdata byYChartsCisco is extrem profitable, produc oper margin around 25%. The compani ha produc $12.4 billion of free cash flow over the past 12 months, compar with a market capit of about $150 billion. Back out the $36 billion of net cash on the balanc sheet, and Cisco' cash-adjust price to free cash flow ratio is a paltri 9.2.The rise of cloud comput and software-defin network ha introduc quit a bit of uncertainty. Whether Cisco can remain as domin as it is today in it core market go forward is an open question. But the pessimist stock price give investor a substanti margin of safety. Cisco doesn't need to be the growth compani it onc wa for an invest in the stock to work out well. It just need to do better than the market expects. And the market isn't expect much.An overlook small-cap stockKulick & Soffa is not a well-known company.

But the compani ha done a good job remain profit dure the tough times, onli post one annual net loss in the past decade. Kulick & Soffa' balanc sheet wa a big factor in my decis to buy the stock in the first place. At the end of the most recent quarter, the compani had $548 million in cash and no debt. Even after the surg in the stock price, cash still repres nearli half of Kulick & Soffa' market capitalization.Averag around $50 million in net incom annually, albeit with a lot of variation, Kulick & Soffa wa too cheap to ignor when it wa trade for around $10 per share.

But, of course, invest is rare thi simple, so let' take a look at what you need to know befor decid whether to buy these large-cap cash cows.makeArticleAd();Th valu propositionA you can see in the tabl below, both have attract FCF-to-enterpris valu (market cap plu net debt) multiples. In plain English, thi mean that Cisco System is current gener more than 10% of it market cap in FCF, while Oracl clock in around 8%. H owever, as is often the case with cash cow stocks, revenu growth is low.However, both have good return on invest capit (net incom after tax divid by invest capital), a use measur becaus an increas ROIC suggest a compani can increas FCF in the futur even if revenu and earn are flat.

Not so fast -- these type of stock can be valu trap out to catch an unsuspect investor. Let' look closer at them.Oracl analysisBoth compani have threats/opportun from the cloud, but Oracl is arguabl better place to address them. Oracle' challenge/opportun in the next few year is to:Replac it declin hardwar and on-premis softwar licens sale with it fast-grow cloud revenues.Grow revenu while navig the shift to cloud-bas subscript sales, which forgo a larg part of upfront revenu typic gener by on-licens softwar sales.Her is a breakout of Oracle' revenu growth for the first six month of it fiscal 2017, which end in May. As you can see below, growth in cloud-bas revenu (software, platform and infrastructur as a service) is current offset declin elsewher -- most notabl in on-premis new softwar licenses.SectorRevenu ChangeConstant-Curr GrowthShar of RevenueCloud Saa and PaaS$74181%9%Cloud IaaS$219%2%On-premis new softwar licenses($452)(15%)13%On-premis softwar licens updat and product support$1913%55%Hardwar products($183)(15%)6%Hardwar support(57%)(4%)6%Servic revenue($72)(3%)9%Total$1892%100%Data source: Oracl Corpor presentations. Tabl by author. Data in million of U.S. dollars.Ther are two reason to be optimistic. First, analyst are forecast Oracle' revenu to grow 1.3% in 2017, with 3.3% expect for 2018.Second, cloud-bas subscript sale don't show the full picture, becaus they produc an annual recur revenu of roughli a third of an up-font licens sale. Thi is becaus subscript revenu is recogn over time, while sit on the balanc sheet as defer revenue.Thi mean that report revenu is not entir reflect of underli growth. Moreover, a look at short-term defer revenu -- up 8% in constant-curr term in the second quarter -- confirm Oracle' underli busi growth is good.Finally, a quick look at FCF/sale suggest Oracl is hold up well dure the transition, but declin in oper incom in the last two year have hit ROIC. No matter, if EP bounc back to 9% growth as expect in the year end May 2018, the stock will start to look veri cheap.Data source: Oracl Corpor presentations. Chart by author.Cisco analysisWhil Oracl seem to be on track, the cloud appear to be creat more problem than opportun for Cisco Systems. Increas usag of network virtual could mean compani run their network architectur in the cloud rather than in Cisco' sophist switches. Unfortunately, these switch tend to be expens and good revenu gener for Cisco.Similarly, if Cisco' router and switch (which gener around 45% of it revenue) becom commoditized, then less expens option from competitor like Huawei or ZTE could threaten Cisco' market position. Indeed, a look at it quarterli switch and rout revenu show that combin switch and rout revenu growth ha been neg for the last four quarters.NGN = next-gener network. Data source: Cisco System presentations. Chart by author.Put simply, Cisco need to stabil it core switch and rout revenu while use it FCF to invest and grow it non-cor operations. It' a different, and more difficult, problem than that face by Oracle, and for that reason Cisco should trade at a discount to it tech peer.Wil Oracl Corpor stock fli high in 2017? Imag source: Oracl Corpor website.Which is the better buy?Cisco is definit a cash cow, but the risk to it core product remains, and if it product becom commodit then pricing, earnings, and cash flow could go into protract decline. Oracle, on the other hand, look to be on track with it transit toward the cloud, and for that reason look like a more attract investment.10 stock we like better than OracleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nor is it mishandl of the company' polici chang regard itstransgendercustomers' use of it bathroom and fit rooms.Whil these aren't game breaker by ani means, you can't help but wonder if Target is perman off it game.Head into 2017, investor are go to be look at what kind of Christma the discount retail had and whether there' ani point in continu to give TGT stock the benefit of the doubt.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017Here are three pro and con central to whether you should buy Target stock.Target Stock ProsRevers to the Mean:Target stock ha beenbeatenbi the S&P 500 in four out of the last six year and by it discount store peer in three of the last six - not exactli the kind of perform investor are look for.However, if you believe, as I do, that stock tend to return to their histor averag after a period of underperform or over performance, than TGT stock is readi for a bounce.In 2015, Target underperform the index by 289 basi points; in 2016, that spread will jump to almost 900 basi points, a much wors result than the year before.Look at Target' financials, one shouldn't be nearli as pessimist about it chances.Bottom Line:Whil the top line face some issu in 2016, the bottom line fare much better. In the first nine month of the year end Octob 29, Target' EBITDA increas by 1.6% year-over-year to$5.3 billionand gener an EBITDA margin of 10.9%, 90 basi point higher than in the same period a year earlier.Especi posit wa it third-quart report which saw EBITDA profit increas by a robust 6.8% to $1.6 billion gener an EBITDA margin of 9.9%, 130 basi point higher than in the same quarter a year earlier.Even CEO Brian Cornel wa surprised.""W are veri pleas with our third quarter financi results, which reflect meaning improv in our traffic and sale trend and much stronger-than-expect profitability,""saidCornell. ""Favor gross margin mix and effici execut by our team drove third quarter EP perform well beyond our guidance.""It might be face some top-lin comp struggl but it can still deliv the good when it come to profit and if I can onli have strong top-lin or strong bottom-lin growth, I'll take profit over sale ani day of the week.Digital:It onlin sale grew by 26% in the third quarter contribut 0.7% compar sale growth against a 1% declin in compar sale at it physic locations. Without the onlin busi growing, Target' Q3 2016 sale would have look even more anem than they actual were.Look on the bright side, it digit channel grew by 60 basi point in the first nine month of 2016 and now repres 3.5% of Target' overal revenue.InvestorPlac contributor Chri Fraley made a good pointrecentlythat Target shopper are younger than the typicalWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT) shopper which suggest that when it come to grow it onlin business, Target' got a much greater upsid than WMT does.Mor importantly, Target custom are wealthier than WMT customers, which mean they'll be more inclin to shop onlin and pay for the last minut ship costs.Target Stock ConsDigital:Say what? Didn't I just say that it onlin busi wa a posit for the company? I did indeed. But, busi isn't alway black or white. More often it' gray. Target should be asham of itself for gener onli 3.5% of it busi from it digit business.Sure, $2.6 billion sound big until you realiz that Target gener more than $73 billion a year in annual revenues. I'v said it befor and I'll say it again. If you'r a big-tim retailer, onlin revenu ha to repres at least10%of overal sale on annual basis.Holiday Revenue:Accord to S&P Global Market Intelligence, 10 U.S. retail were expect to generate66%of thi year' holiday revenues. Target' on the list, which is good news, but it' onli expect to account for 3.7% of the retail revenu gener by all of the retail constitu that make up the S&P 1500.Meanwhile, WMT, it biggest rival other thanAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), is expect to grab 23% of the holiday revenu gener by retail in the broader index.That' a good news, bad news type of situat for Target.Th good news is that it spread Target revenu across 12 month of the year make it less vulner to econom downturn where custom cut back on Christma spending.Th bad news is that Christmas, as Black Friday' histori suggests, can be the differ between a good year and a great year. On that note, WMT is much more like to pleas it sharehold at thi time of year.Groceries:I'm a big fan of Phil Lempert whose weeklyfood reviewsat Supermarketguru.com I watch them religiously. Recently, he wa ask about the neg associ with Target' move to captur some groceri busi from WMT and others.""[Target groceri section were placed] not in the front of the store, but off to the side, or in the back,"" LemperttoldFox News. ""It' still go to have food over here, and tire over there. And for some peopl that' great.""I total can relat to that.Befor Target pull out of Canada, it groceri section wa at the back of the store' second floor, far remov from anything. Target fail in Canada for a lot of reason and that wa certainli one of them.Canadian aren't particularli fond of have to hunt for their food unless actual hunt is involved.Lempert suggest that the groceri section are get better placement these day but the damag may alreadi have been done.Bottom Line on Target StockTarget stock is cheaper than all of it discount peers, groceri stores, and even most depart store with the except ofDillard's, Inc.(NYSE:DDS) whose P/E ratio is a very-low 11.1 time earnings.Whi Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Won't Be Grow Anytim SoonIt current yield 3.3% which is better than most of it peers. If you current own TGT stock, I'd be inclin to own it as long as the yield remain abov 3%.With a decent balanc sheet and a good nose for profits, Target won't be the worst stock to own in 2017.

However, look at the pictur for the entir year, Nokia stock is still off 31% year-to-date. The fact is that despit the recent comeback, NOK stock still face sever tough fundament challenges.Source:Open Grid Schedul / Grid Engin via Flickr (Modified)Consid that NOK' outlook for next year call for a 2% declin in the network business. It' import to note that telecom carrier have been hold off on purchas becaus they have alreadi spent substanti amount on upgrad their network to 4G technologies.makeArticleAd();Ther is also weak in emerg markets. In fact, with the surg of the dollar, the problem may get even worse. All of thi is kind of grim, right? But when it come to investing, a contrarian approach can certainli lead to nice profits.So doe Nokia stock fit the bill? Perhap the compani is pois for a turnaround? Well, let' take a look.Thre Pro to Own Nokia StockInnovation: Nokia Technolog is the segment that focus on consum and profession technolog offerings, such as those for digit health and media. Although, for the most part, much of the growth ha been from licens it extens patent portfolio.Th 7 WORST Stock to Buy for 2017But NOK is certainli invest aggress with it own innovations. For example, the compani ha develop a sophist virtual realiti system for professionals. One of the marque client isSoni Corp(ADR)(NYSE:SNE), which ha had lot of success with it PlayStat VR platform.In addit to this, Nokia is make anoth play for the smartphon market. The devic is call theNokia P, which is base onAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android oper system and will be manufactur byHon Hai Precis Industri Co. Ltd.(OTCMKTS:HNHPF). Granted, the smartphon market is brutal competitive. But it is encourag that NOK is take some risks. Besides, the compani ha a lot of experi market technolog in develop countries.Nokia stock ha also been get more adventuresom with merger and acquisitions. Just look at the deal for Withings. The compani is a pioneer in the connect health market, such as with digit weight scales, activ tracker and babi monitors. Accord to NOK' own research, the market is expect to grow at a compound annual rate of37% from 2015 to 2020.Network: NOK ha a high-performance, end-to-end platform, cover mobil networks, fix networks, IP/opt networks, applic and analytics. Becaus of this, the compani ha been abl to sell to a wide assort of customers, such as in vertic like energy, the public sector and transportation. What' more, the recent acquisit of Gainspe ha been import in attract cabl oper custom too.But the real play is for 5G mobil networks. Accord to areportfromTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(NASDAQ:ERIC), the market is expect to hit 550 million user by 2022. A key driver will be the megatrend of the Internet of Things, which involv wireless connect among devices, as well as video and VR.Accord toInvestorPlace.com' Dana Blankenhorn: ""If you get into Nokia now, you'r catch the next wave of network spend at it bottom, and can ride that wave to profit. That is the bull case, and while that might take some time to prove out, it' a good bet carrier will spend again in the next three to five years.""Dividend and Fiscal Disciplne: With the transform acquisit of Alcaltel Lucent, NOK is expect to gener save of €1.2 billion per year. And these may ultim prove to be fairli conservative. If anything, NOK ha shown a great abil to be disciplin with it cost structure.In other words, margin are like to expand over time, especi as the network busi start to recover.In the meantime, investor will like enjoy a competit dividend, which is at nearli 6%.Three Con to Own Nokia StockHistori and Brand: NOK ha a stori history. Back in the late 1980s, the compani realiz the potenti of the mobil industri and start to develop it own devices. Nokia wa also critic in establish the core standard for wireless systems. So by the end of the 1990s, the compani wa one of the most valuabl tech oper in the world.But unfortunately, NOK fail to keep up the innovation, which allowedAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and GOOGL to domin the market. By 2012, Nokia stock sunk below $2 a share and it look like surviv wa in doubt.So yes, it is remark that the compani ha been abl to get some stabil and invest in growth. But then again, when it come to turnaround in the tech industry, the success rate is usual not so good. It is incred tough to catch up - and there is alway the tarnish of the brand. After all, how mani peopl want to buy a product from a compani that seem like a has-been?Competition: Even with the consolidation, the network busi remain highli competitive. Granted, some of the rival are not particularli strong, such as Ericsson. But these kind of compani can still be veri problemat sinc they are often tempt to engag in price wars.Although, for NOK stock the biggest threat could be from the oper in China, like Huawei and ZTE. They not onli have the benefit of low-cost platform but also preferenti access to their home markets.Moreover, growth ha been strong. For the first half of thi year, the revenu of Huawei spike by40% to $36.8 billion. Then again, the compani ha a diversifi revenu base, which not onli includ the sale of network equip but also smartphon (rank No. 3 in the world).Currently, NOK ha the second highest market share for wireless infrastructur equipment, at about 26%. Thi compar to Huawei' 23%. However, given the company' growth ramp, it probabl won't be long until it becom the world leader.Should You Buy Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsPatents: Licens of intellectu properti ha been the onli growth driver for Nokia stock. In thelatest quarter, thi busi help ignit a 109% increas in sale for the Nokia Technolog division. The run-rat for the year is expect to hit €950 million.But there is a big issue: About€150 millionof exist licens revenu will expir thi year. Thi is one of the reason NOK ha beenramp up it legal efforts.Yet thi type of litig can be time consum and unpredictable. And even if there is a win, it can still take year of appeal to get ani resolution. More importantly, AAPL is known to be a tough fighter when it come to IP claims.Bottom Line On Nokia StockWhil the long-term prospect of 5G look promising, it will take time for the market to get going. Custom will certainli tri to find way to delay the heavi invest and tri to find way to keep leverag the exist networks. There are also the intens competit forc that will weigh on margins.In the meantime, NOK stock must deal with other problems, such as the expir of a bulk of the licens business.

The compani start to chang cours follow longtim CEO John Chamber' exit last year. Chuck Robbin took the rein last July, and ha refocus the company' strategi toward the cloud. Robbin ha acquir mani busi in that space. 2016 deliv better result for CSCO stock, and 2017 is shape up nicely, as analyst forecast renew strength in networking.Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Add it all up, and Cisco stock final got some traction. After trade essenti flat for the past decade, CSCO stock is up 12% in 2016. Can the good time continu head into next year?makeArticleAd();CSCO Stock ConsTransit Challenges: Cisco, like mani older tech companies, reli on legaci technologies. Older invent still drive much of CSCO' profit and cash flow. Consid switching, for example. Thi segment account for almost a third of Cisco' sales, yet it is declin at a high single-digit rate. Thus, it need to find a lot of growth in other area to make up for the steadi eros of it top offering. Bull can counter thi point by show other segments, such as security, that rose at a double-digit rate. But these gain come from a small start base, and are often in area with more aggress competition.Cisco is inde make the right move with big push in cloud, secur and services. However, at least for the next coupl of years, these appear mere suffici to offset declin elsewhere, rather than power the compani as a whole to meaning growth. There are wors posit in the world than sit on $70 billion in cash while milk cash cow legaci businesses. However, for strong CSCO stock perform in the future, these newer initi need to replac the current fade divisions.Erod Posit Competitively: While Cisco' longer-term result still seem fairli strong, there are worri signs. Gross margins, for one. Cisco gener gross margin in excess of 70% in 2003, and tradit earn high 60 margin last decade. These slip to the high 50 recently, befor rebound modestli in 2016. Fall margin indic a slip competit position. Other compani are hit Cisco on price and take away the company' profitability.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017The company' return on asset ha also drop sharply. It tradit ran around 14% to 15% prior to the Great Financi Crisis. In recent years, thi ha fallen into the singl digits, and sit at about 9% currently. Thi reflect the company' inabl to convert profit into new opportunities. Whether thi is becaus the compani ha cash tie up oversea or simpli due to a lack of invest opportunities, it lead to poor return on CSCO stock. A compani that can't find attract use for it cash will struggl to deliv strong returns.China Risk: Cisco gener almost half of it revenu outsid of the U.S. Given President-elect Trump' threat to target China specif and trade in general, Cisco is more vulner than mani to a trade war.Mani of the product that Cisco make can be copi by cheaper Asian competition. Compani such asHuaweiwould love to take more market share away from Cisco. And in a scenario where variou countri start throw retaliatori tariff back at the U.S., it would put Cisco in an unfavor position. Combin that with the worsen overvalu U.S. dollar issue, and Cisco may have issu internationally.CSCO Stock ProsCash Come Home: Cisco current oper with a gigant cash pile. The compani count more than $70 billion in cash and short-term market securities. The vast major of thi is held off-shor to avoid taxat on profits. Should Trump get hi way, it appear that there would be a tax break, allow compani such as Cisco to bring their money back to the U.S.Given that Cisco' whole market cap is just $150 billion, it' clear that have more than $60 billion in newli avail cash could unlock real valu in CSCO stock. Whether the compani use it to boost the alreadi solid dividend, buy back stock or make acquisitions, ani such avenu is like to produc better result than the current situation.Rel Cheap: Cisco stock current trade around 15x earn and 13x forward earnings. That compar quit favor to the tech industri as a whole. Although if you view CSCO as a so-cal tech util - with much less growth - the valuat is about what you'd expect.That said, Cisco stock ha proven itself capabl of continu to grow at a modest clip. The compani ha grown revenu at a compound 7.5% rate over the past 10 years. And free cash flow ha advanc 6.6% annual over that same span. Given the gener overvalu in the U.S. stock market, a compani trade at 15x earn with 6% to 7% growth rate over the longer haul isn't a bad idea.Big Dividend: The 3.4% dividend make CSCO stock the singl highest yield mega-cap tech compani in the U.S: 3.4% place it just ahead ofIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) at 3.36%. Cisco ha grown the dividend at a 22% annual rate over the past five years, and rais it 20% thi past year.Should I Buy Intern Busi Machin Corp. (IBM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsOf course, a good chunk of that came from the rise dividend payout ratio. The compani ha elect to return more cash to shareholders. That said, over the last coupl of years, the dividend payout ratio ha stabilized, while the dividend continu to rise. Should the cash repatri plan come into effect, CSCO should have plenti of runway to keep rais the dividend at a strong clip for year to come.Bottom Line on Cisco StockCSCO stock is one of the U.S.' cheapest larg tech companies. And it ha some grow divis to pick up the slack for it fade legaci operations. The dividend is large, grow and defend with a strong balanc sheet. However, should Cisco' acquisit and growth strategi fail to play out, the stock could end up dead money, offer littl more than the dividend.At the time of thi writing, Ian Bezek own CSCO stock and IBM stock.

FireEye Inc's Best Moves in 2016,12/28/2016,"I'v generallybeen bearishonFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) , the once-promis cybersecur firm that lost over 40% of it valu in 2016. The company' declin revenu growth, widen GAAP losses, unstabl cash flow, and execut exodu all indic that the stock could fall further next year. However, those challeng shouldn't complet overshadow it accomplish thi year. Let' take a look back at three of FireEye' smartest move in 2016.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();1. Appoint Kevin Mandia as it new CEOFireEye' futur look bleak after CEO David DeWalt abruptli announc hi resign earlier thi year. After all, DeWalt had led FireEy for over four years, and help establish it ""best-in-breed"" reput in threat detect solutions. DeWalt wa also will to sell FireEye, which would have given it investor a quick exit opportunity.However, appoint FireEy Presid Kevin Mandia as DeWalt' successor wa a smart move. Mandia found Mandiant, the cybersecur compani that reveal that an elit Chines hack group wa target U.S. govern and corpor system in 2013. FireEy acquir Mandiant for about $1 billion the follow year, and it machine-bas secur tech play a central role in it threat prevent services.Mandia' transit from presid to CEO ha been fairli smooth. Mandiareportedli isn't interest in sell FireEye. Instead, he'll like focu on improv it long-term growth and profit instead of profit from a quick sale. Under Mandia the compani also decid to lay off 300 to 400 of FireEye' 3,400 workers.That move -- along with other cost-cut initi -- are aim at reduc FireEye' annual cost by $80 million. We alreadi saw some progress last quarter, when it GAAP net loss narrow $0.13 from the prior-year quarter to $0.75 per share. That bottom-lin improv is rare in the cybersecur industry. Next-gen firewal vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) , for example, saw it GAAP loss widen from $0.47 to $0.69 per share last quarter.2. Expand FireEy as a cloud-bas serviceFireEye' sale growth slow down due to wane demand for it on-sit applianc and rise demand for it cloud-bas services. That shift ha been tough, sinc FireEy gener much more revenu on the initi sale of an applianc than gain new subscriptions. But over time, these cloud-bas subscript becom more depend sourc of long-term revenue.FireEye' main product for thi market is FireEy as a Servic (FaaS), which continu detect and analyz threat without the need for larg secur team or manag secur servic providers. In November, FireEy expand that ecosystem with Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid, which add new private, hybrid, and public cloud deploy option for mid-siz and larger businesses.Mandia note that these product still repres the ""earli phase of the richest new innov cycl in our history,"" as the cloud-bas product would help ""custom elev their secur profil at a lower total cost of ownership.""3. Turn FireEy into an all-in-on platformIn late November, FireEy introduc Helix -- an all-in-on platform that bundl it network, endpoint, Threat Analyt Platform, Advanc Threat Intelligence, and FireEy Secur Orchestr togeth in a unifi system with a singl user interface. From that interface, user can add addit servic like FaaS, email, other threat detect tools, and even integr the platform with third-parti threat intellig tools.Thi platform serv as the foundat of a ""FireEy ecosystem,"" which widen it moat against tech giant likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , which bundl it secur solut with it network hardwar and software. It also help FireEy keep pace with perimet secur rival like Palo Alto, which launch a compar bundl dub the Next-Gener Secur Platform earlier thi year. FireEy still face intens competit from compani like Cisco and Palo Alto, but at least Helix help it lock in more custom and widen it moat.Th key takeawayFireEy still ha a lot to prove befor I'd consid buy it as a contrarian play. Analyst expect it revenu to rise just 16% thi year and 10% next year -- which compar poorli to it 46% growth last year. However, I'll still be keep an eye on Mandia' next move as well as FireEye' growth in cloud and platform servic -- which could help the stock rebound next year.10 stock we like better than FireEyeWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Tech Stocks 2016 Recap: Chips Up, FANGs Down",12/27/2016,"Technolog stock in 2016 didn't deliv the oomph investor expected. Not unlike, say, when powerhous FANG stock Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) lit up the market in 2015. But with year-to-d gain of almost 14%, compar to 9% rise in the Nasdaq Composit Index, there' littl for tech investor to complain about.Here' the thing, however: Unlik 2015, FANG stock thi year didn't do the heavi lift and more of the wealth wa share among other tech names. The FANG lost ton of bite and were pretti pedestrian in 2016. Take a look at the chart a few graph below.Aft gain 141% last year, Netflix share have risen just 10% in 2016, mark the biggest drop among the FANG on a percentag basis. Thi wa follow by Amazon, which ha gain about 12.5% year to date, fall from 120% return last year.makeArticleAd();Meanwhile, Facebook and Alphabet, which have post respect 2016 gain of 12% and 4%, struggl to duplic their 2015 respect return of 37% and 49%.In all four cases, expect these compani to repeat their 2015 success would have been unrealistic. But with three out of the four name best the or -- at least -- track the S&P 500 Index' 10% rise, the group didn't stink up the joint. And while Alphabet' 4% rise would seem as a disappointment, take it as a buy opportunity. I expect next year' recap will yield better results.Al told, the FANG were displac by the like AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA), which post respect gain of 303% and 235%. Add in Qualcomm' (QCOM) 38% rise and you'v got a nice chip party. All that' miss is the dip and soft drinks. Speak of soft, Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 17% in 2016, seem rejuven under CEO Satya Nadella' cloud-first strategy. While 17% is noth to brag about compar to AMD, Microsoft stock will end 2016 at near tech-bubbl highs.Likewise, IBM (IBM), which ha soar some 26% thi year, will end the year as one of tech' biggest surprises. Rais your had if you saw Big Blue post such green. Notably, despit suffer iPhon revenu and shipment declines, the fact that Appl (AAPL) ha gain 13% in 2016 underscor the level of optim investor have about 2017. It remain to be seen whether Appl can deliver. But with some $230 billion in cash on the balanc sheet, a 2.00% dividend yield and new product on the way, take a bite out of Appl never seem like a bad idea.Bi contrast, despit Twitter' (TWTR) 28% decline, it will be tough for the compani to turn thing around in 2017. Same with GoPro (GPRO), which lost some 50% of it valu in 2016. But if either compani get acquir in 2017, all bet are off.Two stock to keep an eye on are Intel (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO).

By invest heavili in research and develop (R&D), these compani are make expens bet on the futur and what technolog and trend will lead it -- along with their own sale and profits.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();6 compani invest billion in R&DTo compil thi list, we look at the total dollar amount that publicli trade tech compani have each spent on R&D over the past year. There are mani compani invest heavili in R&D, both by real dollar amount and also rel to their own market cap., but here are the six compani that stood out as shape the futur base on how much they have invested, and will probabl continu to do so, to be the one at the forefront of futur development.CompanyMarket CapR&D Spend (Previou 12 Months)Alphabet Inc.$531 billion$13.8 billionIntel Corporation$176 billion$13 billionMicrosoft Corporation$468 billion$12.1 billionAppl Inc.$582 billion$10 billionOracl Corporation$159 billion$6.5 billionCisco Systems, Inc.$148 billion$6.3 billionData source: Capit IQWhat those billion are go afterIt' not surpris thatAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) top the list as the biggest investor in the in the world in term of R&D spend. Alphabet' willing to spend heavili on research into area such as self-driv cars, artifici intelligence, and wearabl technolog such as Googl Glass and connect cloth show how the compani is work to assur it ha a place in the world far beyond the internet search that current make up the vast major of it revenue. Alphabet' recent restructur to make Googl one segment of the overal compani wa specif design to allow the compani to continu make audaci moonshot bets.Alphabet' self-driv car project, now call Waymo. Imag source: Alphabet/Waymo.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recent announc that it will releas a devic to compet in the smart-hom space. Power by it Cortana voice-en artifici intellig platform, thi devic will compet directli with similar product such as Googl Home. Other big invest in the past few year from Microsoft includ cloud comput and more work on it Window oper system for mobil devic and as an ""Internet of Things"" platform. It' yet to be seen how Microsoft' recent acquisit of LinkedIn will fulli play out, but you can expect that it link up with some of the area Microsoft ha been invest heavili in already.Intel,Oracle, andCisco Systemsar each work hard to keep their industry-domin posit from younger and more fast-pac compani within the microprocessor, graphic chip, and comput network space. These three behemoth compani have been build and develop infrastructur for cloud computing, internet security, and other digital-ag network servic that requir new technolog far beyond what their own technolog could handl in year past. Build and prepar for these big growth trend in such a fast-mov segment of the IT industri will like drive higher R&D spend in these compani for year to come.Finally, there'sApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Thi compani ha been the focu of much analysi in the past few year for not releas enough new and astonish tech, so much so that mani of those analyst have question if Apple' growth day are behind it. However, the compani is one of the biggest investor in R&D, seemingli go after the connected-car market, artifici intelligence, or other long-term invest such as build much more comprehens softwar platforms. What make Appl especi interest is that it' by far the wealthiest compani on the list by total cash value, which wa a record of nearli $238 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and market secur in it most recent quarter. That' more than doubl the cash of second-plac Microsoft, with $117 billion.Prepar for bigger spend to comeIf those number don't alreadi look massiv enough, they could get bigger in the come years. Apple' $238 billion in cash? The vast major of that amount is store offshore, where Appl is hold it becaus the compani doesn't want to pay the around 35% corpor tax to repatri it back to the Unit States.A part of a tax system overhaul, President-elect Donald Trump ha said he seek to lower thi corpor tax rate and could even provid a special 10% tax for compani that are seek to repatri a huge chunk of cash back to the States.Th richest compani in the U.S., then, includ mani of the compani in the preced list, would probabl then repatri much of that cash and could put the money to work in increas R&D spending.Lik much of the potenti chang come to corpor tax or other policy, there' no tell when thi might happen, what the final number will be, how much each of that oversea cash each compani would bring back, or what the compani will do with the money. Still, either way, these compani and mani like them are like to continu spend heavili on research and develop the next wave of new technolog that will drive their industri in the year ahead -- someth that long-term investor won't want to miss.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

CEO Chuck Robbin referenc uncertainti in the world economy, as well as potenti regul under the incom Donald Trump administration.Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Although you can't go wrong er on the side of caution, Cisco might be hedg their bet unnecessarily. There are a number of technolog sector in which the network giant can leverag it power, key among them be theInternet of Things. Thi is a market that' project to hit $1.7 trillion by the year 2020.makeArticleAd();Furthermore, the compani ha a divis call ""IoT System and Software."" You can't get ani more direct than that for CSCO stock!Understandably, with a lucr market come intens competition. The IoT busi is uniqu in that it bring out aneclect bunch.NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), andGener Electr Company(NYSE:GE) are all compet in one form or another.

By default, the compani can provid the physic connect through itsvast networks. Also, Cisco can offer secur mechan and standard measur for IoT devic makers.Strong technic tailwind for CSCO stockAl of these are wonder reason to consid buy up CSCO stock. However, what I like best is it technic momentum. Frankly, a fundament stori is onli that - a story. The differ is whether or not investor are will to risk money on it.Most indic suggest that Cisco stock is pois for greater thing in the come years.Let' start with the low-hang fruit. Year-to-date, Cisco share are up over 12%. Base on recent trends, the actual return shouldn't be too far off from that figure. Yes, the price action ha been a littl choppi sinc the begin of September. Nevertheless, CSCO stock is trade abov it 50- and 200-day move averages.I'm also encourag by the substant gain made in the wake of the ""Great Recession."" From 2008 until the end of 2011, CSCO stock return a lousi -7%. But from 2012 onwards, it ha been a differ compani altogether, with Cisco averag 14% in the black. If it weren't for a volatil 2015, the averag would be much higher.Even then, you have to love how CSCO stock just brush the neg aside.Cisco Stock Broke Past a Key Resist LevelClick to EnlargeMov forward, the prospect for Cisco are bright for investors.I say thi becaus the compani bust open a long-term resist level. In 2007, the averag high on an adjust basi wa a littl over $28. Thi is approxim the same price point where Cisco stock falter last year. As previous mentioned, it pick itself up in impress fashion. More importantly, share are convincingli abov the bearish ceiling.If CSCO stock had failed, we would be look at a double-top formation. Bearish trader would have note that the bull attempt to push Cisco abov a psycholog threshold without success. That could have led to a self-fulfil prophesy, engend further panic.Fortunately, that' not how thing turn out. I would argu that with the breakthrough, CSCO stock ha a clean slate. Combin with it enorm strength and financi stability, thi is a compani on the rise. Unless there wa an absolut compel reason to bet against Cisco stock, investor are much safer go long.Und Armour Inc (UA) Stock or Nike Inc (NKE): Which to Own in 2017?Of course, tech is hardli a consist and reliabl sector.

The Best Dividend Stocks in the Dow Averages,12/22/2016,"It' been a strang year for high-yield stocks. In the first half of 2016, the Dow Jone util average, a proxi for hefti dividend payers, wa a market leader, rise 26%. Sinc then, however, it ha tumbl 6%. And it ha been a notabl laggard dure the post-elect rally, fall 1% sinc Novemb 8, while the broad market, as measur by Standard & Poor' 500-stock index, advanc 6%.What' a yield-seek investor to think now, with a lot of hot money chase stock that should benefit from rise rate (such as financials) and faster econom growth (such as industri manufactur and produc of steel, copper and other materials)?makeArticleAd();Portfolio manag suggest that in thi environ it make sens to invest in compani that should deliv both above-averag dividend growth and above-averag earnings. We analyz the 65 stock in the Dow Jone industrial, transport and util averag and came up with 10 that meet those criteria and should provid investor with solid returns. We focus on thi univers becaus inclus in one of the Dow averag is a testament to a company' size and financi strength. The market capit of the smallest compani on our list is $55.7 billion.Th stock have an averag yield of 2.7%, and all but one yield more than the averag 2.1% yield of the S&P 500 index.ChevronIf you'r bullish onoil prices, Chevron is attractive, say Paul Franzen, a senior analyst with the Commerc Valu Fund. And it look much more appeal than ExxonMobil (XOM), the world' biggest publicli trade energi compani and also a member of the Dow Jone industrials.Chevron should see annual product of oil and ga rise by 5% over the next three years, compar with 1% per year for Exxon. In addition, Exxon ha a lot of exposur to refin and chemicals, which Chevron doe not. That would be a rel plu for Chevron becaus rise crude price pressur refin and chemic profits.Chevron ha a number of asset that should deliv solid return with oil price back in the $50-a-barrel area and perhap head higher. One particularli attract hold is the roughli 2 million acr it own in the Permian Basin in Texa and New Mexico, the second-largest oil field in the world. Analyst Pavel Molchanov of Raymond Jame think thi hold could be worth $30 billion, or about 14% of the company' market cap.Beyond the Permian Basin, one of Chevron' two huge liquefi natur ga facil in Australia just went online, and the other one will go onlin soon. Anoth advantag for Chevron is that a rel small amount of it asset are in global hot spot or polit unattract locations. For instance, onli 2% of it reserv are in the Middl East (compar with 13% for it competitors, other enorm multin energi companies), and none are in Russia (compar with 12% for it rivals).Don't put too much stock in the 313% earn growth that analyst expect Chevron to deliv next year. The figur is larg becaus profit remain depress in 2016 due to the recent crash in oil prices. By the same token, becaus of the profit slump, Chevron' unappet price-earn ratio is inflat by weak profits. Even dure tough times, though, Chevron ha been a gener dividend payer. It ha boost it payout by an averag of 9% annual sinc 2005.Ultimately, the price of oil will be the key driver of Chevron' share price. Molchanov, who think oil will averag $80 a barrel in 2017, compar with $52.40 today, say Chevron is more sensit to crude price than it main competitors. ""It' good to be oily,"" he says.Se Also:27 Best Stock to Buy Now for 2017Cisco SystemsTh network giant' stock price is almost exactli where it wa 10 year ago. Growth remain sluggish, with revenu have climb just 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (end in October) over the same period a year earlier.Tax cut favor by President-elect Donald Trump, includ a lower corpor tax rate and a cut in tax on profit repatri from outsid the U.S., would help Cisco, but there are other reason to like the stock. Cisco is begin to emerg as a network-secur powerhouse. That busi gener $2 billion in revenu in fiscal 2017, and secur revenu rose 11% in the August-Octob quarter. Granted, mani old tech companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), are herald their secur chops, but Cisco' annual haul is alreadi bigger than that of Palo Alto Network (PANW), the lead standalon secur firm.In the switch and router markets, meanwhile, Cisco is fight against compani make hot new machin and other just tri to replic Cisco' offer at a lower price. Cisco' solution? It is tri to bundl softwar with it hardwar and convinc custom to pay for the softwar via an annual subscript payment. Overall, subscript revenu grew by 33% in the fiscal year that end in Juli 2016, and Cisco now deriv half of it secur revenu from softwar or by subscript (the rest is from hardwar sales). ""The strategi is working,"" say Jennif Chang, manag of the Cullen High Dividend Equiti Fund.Chang think the compani can deliv mid- to high-single-digit earn growth over the next three to five years. ""The dividend can grow even faster,"" she says. In fact, Cisco in Februari rais it quarterli payout by an eye-pop 24%. And the stock look cheap, sell for 30% less than the S&P 500' P/E of 17.NextEra EnergySom peopl might think the elect result precipit a perfect storm for NextEra Energy. As a member of the Dow util average, not onli is the stock sensit to interest rates--which have been rise sinc Elect Day--th compani is also the util sector' renewable-energi leader. And Trump seem to favor fossil fuel much more than renew energi sources, such as wind and solar.NextEra' stock ha fallen nearli 4%% sinc the election. But that may not be just an overreaction; instead, it may be a move in the wrong direction. Mani of the tax credit that the company--and it customers--get for solar and wind project will last through the end of 2019, then start to phase out, eventu disappear at the end of 2022. And mani wind and solar project make econom sens without ani tax credit at all.In addit to serv fast-grow Florida, NextEra ha grown by sign 20-year energi deal with industri client such as Gener Electr (GE). Mani more agreement should follow. The compani expect it earn per share to rise by 6% to 8% a year through 2018, with dividend grow consider faster, at an annual rate of 12% to 14%.See Also:8 Great Dividend-Pay Stock in the Russel 2000 IndexJohnson & JohnsonIf you'r worri that drug price might be subject to govern price control but still want to own a larg pharmaceut company, you'll be hard-press to find a better choic than Johnson & Johnson. That' becaus in J&J' most recent report quarter (July-September), the compani deriv onli 47% of it sale from drugs. Medic devic account for 35%, and consum products, such as Band-Aids, Listerin and Tylenol, were respons for the rest.And if you are look for dividend growth and dependability, you need look no further. J&J ha increas it annual payout for 53 consecut years. A tax cut on repatri earn might help boost the payout further, given that almost all of the more than $40 billion in cash and secur on J&J' balanc sheet is held overseas.With revenu and earn expect to grow at a mid-single-digit rate over the next few years, it is reason to expect annual dividend growth of 6% to 8%. J&J ha achiev $1 billion in product gain over the past three years. And in January, it announc that it would elimin 3,000--or 6%--of the job in it medical-devic division.Bear worri about the loss of J&J' patent for the company' top-sel drug, Remicade, a rheumatoid arthriti treatment that gener $6.6 billion in annual sales. After a judg invalid the patent in August, Pfizer introduc a rival drug (call a biosimilar becaus it is made from biolog components) in November. But Pfizer price the drug onli 15% lower than Remicade, less of a discount than investor initi feared. And J&J say that it ha posit itself to withstand the assault, note that patient with commerci insur pay just $5 per dose with a Remicad co-pay card (a discount card issu by the drug' manufacturer) and that 48% of Remicad patient with commerci insur have no co-pay whatsoever.Analyst say J&J ha a strong pipelin of drug in development, so the company, which wa found 130 year ago, may have anoth centuri or two of growth ahead of it. And, who knows, it might rais it dividend annual for the next 53 year as well.Unit Parcel ServiceKnown as Brown, for the color of it ubiquit truck and the uniform of their drivers, UP is a powerhous not just in the U.S. Onli three compani move packag internationally--FedEx (FDX) and DHL are the others--and UP is by far the most efficient. Plus, oversea revenu are grow faster than in the U.S. From 2016 to 2019, the compani expect revenu in the U.S. to rise by 5% to 6% a year, compar with intern revenu growth of 6% to 9% annually. It expect earn to increas by 9% to 13% annually.Anoth plu for UPS: It pay a high feder corpor tax rate of 34% to 36%, so it could benefit from tax reform. ""It is one of the reason you could see profit-margin expansion,"" say Matt Moulis, manag of the Fidel Select Transport Fund, which ha UP as it second-largest holding. Moreover, he says, ""a signific portion of the busi is recurring, includ the shipment of stapl and holiday gifts.""Sinc go public in 1999, UPS, a member of the Dow transport average, ha lift it dividend at a 10% annual pace. Expect that to continue. But what about futur competit from Amazon, which ha been buy cargo plane of late? So far, it seem the e-commerc giant is simpli tri to find a way to make on-tim deliveri at peak gift-giv times. Still, e-commerc now account for more than 40% of UP business, and investor have to be alert to chang afoot at Amazon. But UP ha shown it can be flexible. To execut ""not-at-home"" deliveries, it ha creat 27,000 worldwid access point where custom can pick up their packages.SE ALSO:8 Best 'YARP' Stock for Dividend InvestorsMicrosoftAt Microsoft' last sharehold meeting, in November, CEO Satya Nadella said that by 2025 the world will produc 180 zettabyt of data. (A zettabyt is sextillion bytes, or 10 to the 21st power bytes.) No wonder the world need the cloud. And Microsoft' masteri of the cloud is a big part of the company' growth story. ""Microsoft' cloud is now competit with Amazon Web Services,"" say Ramona Persaud, manag of the Fidel Dividend Growth Fund.At the end of the fiscal year that end June 30, Microsoft wa gener cloud revenu at an annual rate of more than $12 billion, an increas of slightli more than 50% from the previou year. Nadella say cloud revenu will reach $20 billion by the fiscal year that end in June 2018. As the busi expands, profit margin should improve.Oth part of the busi are also prosper and offset weak sale of oper system and applic softwar for the stagnant person comput market. Sale of the Surfac tablet rose by 65% in fiscal 2016, to $3.6 billion; 49 million custom subscrib monthli to Xbox Live; and search engin Bing just becam profitable. Analyst also think Microsoft will be abl to find new sourc of revenu from LinkedIn, the business- and employment-ori social network that it recent purchas for $26 billion.Analyst and fund manag are effus in their prais for Nadella, who becam CEO in 2014. ""Nadella is veri shareholder-friendly,"" say Fidelity' Persaud. And investor may soon realiz just how friendly. Microsoft ha $137 billion in cash and secur on it balanc sheet, almost all of it held abroad. If the tax on repatri earn is reduced, Microsoft sharehold are like to see more dividend increas and share buybacks.Unit TechnologiesIf you screen for compani that are expect to gener superior earn growth in 2017, you won't find Unit Technologies. In fact, profit at the industri conglomerate--which owns, among other things, aircraft-engin maker Pratt & Whitney, Oti Elev and Carrier, the maker of heat and air-condit systems--ar like to be flat to down next year, with revenu climb onli modestly.Th culprit, say Don Taylor, manag of the Franklin Rise Dividend Fund, is Pratt & Whitney' invest in it new PurePow Gear Turbofan jet engines, which reduc fuel use and ground nois in jetliners. The revolutionari jet engin burn 16% less fuel than convent engin and reduc nois by 75%, while also significantli cut carbon dioxid emissions. The compani ha invest about $10 billion in the new engines, and sale are just start to ramp up.Unit Technolog is well-posit to benefit from the growth of commerci aviat all over the world. Increas defens spend dure a Trump administr would also help. The compani project that Pratt & Whitney sale will rise at an annual rate of 10% or more from 2016 through 2020. And the compani is optimist about it other divis as well. It see annual sale gain of 5% to 7% in aerospac systems, 4% to 5% in climat control and secur (in addit to provid heat and cool systems, the compani is a key player in the creation of intelligent, energy-effici buildings), and 4% to 5% for Oti elevators, escal and move walkways. If those growth target are achieved, Unit Technolog should deliv double-digit earn growth and rais it dividend by 8% to 9% a year start in 2018.Unit made headlin recent becaus of the deal it Carrier divis struck with President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, still Indiana' governor, to keep some job at Carrier' Indiana furnac plant. How thi drama will play out for Carrier and the rest of Unit Technolog onc Trump and Penc take offic remain uncertain. In the meantime, investor can pick up thi blue-chip industri company, which will benefit from ani pickup in global growth, at a reason price.SE ALSO:8 Great Stock to Own in RetirementJP Morgan ChaseLik other financi stocks, JP Morgan ha been on a tear sinc the election, rise 24%. But it may not be too late to hop aboard. The compani should benefit from rise interest rate and less-demand regulation, as well as faster econom growth, if that materializes. As it busi ha improved, the bank giant ha been ad capit to it balanc sheet. Each year, regul have been allow the bank to return more cash to shareholders, a trend that should continue, with a posit impact on dividend and stock buybacks.If the corpor tax rate goe down to 20%, JP Morgan' earnings, by one estimate, would rise by about 20%. And if the Feder Reserv doe inde rais short-term interest rate three time in 2017, as it recent suggest it would, that would also boost the bank' earn and, presumably, it stock price. More good news: CEO Jami Dimon told the Wall Street Journal recent that JPMorgan' bond-trad busi ha been much stronger lately. Bond-trad revenu have drop 35% from their 2009 peak, and Dimon now think the compani can recov half of that decline.In evalu JP Morgan, it' import to recogn that European bank regul have been tougher than their counterpart in the U.S. Thi ha given JP Morgan a big edg over rival such as Barclay (BCS) and Deutsch Bank (DB). Anoth posit that hasn't shown up in earn yet but may someday is the slew of dread headlin earn by competitor Well Fargo (WFC). ""JP Morgan is the best of the big banks,"" say Commerc Value' Franzen.Union PacificLik other railroads, Union Pacif ha had a grim 2016, a result of low energi prices. Industrywide, the number of carload fell 6.9% in the first nine month of 2016 (compar with the first nine month of 2015), with coal and oil shipment lead the decline. Union Pacif stock is 15% off it record high, set in Februari 2015. Cheap energi price have been hurt Union Pacif in two ways. Low price led mani power plant to shift to natur ga instead of coal. And low gasolin price made trucker a more attract altern for the shipment of some goods.But with the rise in the price of natur ga and oil, analyst have becom more bullish on Union Pacif and, on average, are call for a 10% earn gain next year. And that estim may be low if the economi turn out to be stronger than expect and oil price rise further or even remain stable.Th compani handl the downturn wisely, reduc capit expenditur in the face of declin demand. But UP continu to reward shareholders, rais it dividend by 10% and boost it share repurchas plan. The compani ha bought back 305 million share sinc 2007 at an averag price of $59.63, well below the current level. Union Pacific' high tax rate may also make it an attract investment. It 2015 tax rate wa 37.7%, so it could see a signific earn pop if corpor tax rate are reduced.New feder regul on trucker may also help the company. By the end of 2017, the nation' trucker will have to instal an electron log devic that will monitor vehicl speed and locations. That will make it much harder for a driver to spend more hour on the road in a day than regul permit.DuPontDuPont is not your grandfather' chemic company.

Will 2017 Be Palo Alto Networks Inc's Worst Year Yet?,12/21/2016,"Share ofPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) have fallen nearli 30% thi year, due to slow sale growth, widen GAAP losses, and the threat of rise competition. By comparison, thePureFund ISE Cybersecur ETF(NYSEMKT: HACK) -- which own a basket of top cybersecurity-rel stock -- rose 4% dure that period.Wil Palo Alto fall even further next year? Let' take a closer look at it tailwinds, headwinds, and valuat to find out.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Palo Alto' tailwindsTh good news for Palo Alto -- which is bad news for companies, governments, and other organ -- is that the number of data breach is rise worldwide. That' whi the global secur market could grow from $122.45 billion today to $202.36 billion by 2021, accord to Research and Markets.Palo Alto is wide consid the ""best in breed"" provid of next-gen firewalls. It serv over 35,000 custom in more than 140 countries, and ha ad over 1,000 new custom per quarter for 20 straight quarters. Over 85 of the Fortun 100 and half of the Global 2000 compani use it services, andGartnerha rank it as an enterpris firewal market leader for the past five years.That grow custom base boost Palo Alto' revenu by 49% to $1.4 billion last year, and analyst expect it sale to rise anoth 31% thi year. It non-GAAP earn more than doubl to $152.6 million last year, and Wall Street expect that figur to rise anoth 67% thi year.Look ahead, Palo Alto' Next-Gener Secur Platform -- which bundl togeth nativ integr technologies, autom protect solutions, and threat intellig share solut in an all-in-on platform -- could widen it moat against bigger tech compani likeCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andSymantec(NASDAQ: SYMC) . Palo Alto is also frequent cite as a potenti takeov target for those larger companies, but it enterpris valu of $11 billion make it a pretti big buy.Palo Alto' headwindsOn the surface, Palo Alto look like a great growth play. But if we dig beneath the headlin numbers, the crack start appearing. The first issu is it slow sale growth. It revenu rose 34% annual to $398.1 million last quarter, but that miss estim by $2.1 million and repres it slowest growth rate sinc it IPO in 2012.That slowdown wa attribut to slower enterpris spending, tougher competit in the firewal market, and a market shift from on-sit applianc to autom solut and subscription-bas softwar and services. Those headwind might be accept for a compani with a lower valuation, but Palo Alto' price-to-sal ratio of 8 leav littl room for disappointment.Th second issu is it widen GAAP losses. Last quarter, Palo Alto' GAAP loss widen from $39.9 million in the prior year quarter to $61.8 million. That loss wa mainli caus by it stock-bas compens (SBC) expenses, which surg 55% annual and claim 29% of it revenues. Unless Palo Alto can get those cost under control, mani investor will like question it abil to ever gener a real profit.Lastly, competit in the firewal and perimet secur market remain fierce. Cisco bundl technolog it gain by acquir Sourcefire, ThreatGRID, and other smaller secur compani into it network hardwar and software. Symantec dramat expand it end-to-end secur capabl with the acquisit of Blue Coat and LifeLock, andFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) ha bundl addit secur servic into it next-gen firewalls. If Palo Alto increas it R&D or sale and market expens to counter those threats, it SBC expens will like spike and caus it GAAP loss to widen.Whi 2017 won't be Palo Alto' worst year yet2017 won't like be Palo Alto' ""worst"" year ever. That titl will still belong to 2016, which saw the stock' worst full-year perform sinc it IPO. But 2017 also probabl won't be a turnaround year for the stock, unless it can either report acceler sale growth or narrow GAAP losses.10 stock we like better than Palo Alto NetworksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Cisco Systems Could Have a Great 2017,12/20/2016,"Network hardwar giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) ha been cautiou when talk about it outlook for the new year. The compani is anticip a revenu declin dure it fiscal second quarter, driven by what the compani call ""a challeng global busi environment."" CEO Chuck Robbin point to macroeconom uncertainti as well as uncertainti surround the polit and regulatori environ follow the elect as the main reason for the weak guidance. The compani is take a conserv approach and not model ani improv in these area go forward.Cisco' guidanc may be too pessimistic. Analyst from Cowen & Co. recent survey 118 IT execut in the U.S. to gather clue about how the IT spend environ would evolv next year. While there wa some uncertainti among those survey due to the result of the election, Cowen found that the major expect IT budget to grow next year. Network infrastructur wa view by the execut as a high priority, suggest that Cisco may be in better shape than it outlook suggests.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Cisco Systems.Good news for CiscoAccord to the survey, 75% of execut expect IT budget in 2017 to be higher than in 2016, with averag growth of 6%. Network is view as an area that will grow it share of the total IT budget, with 58% of execut expect network to eat up a larger portion of IT spend next year. Just 2% are expect a decrease.Network spend may grow substanti faster than overal IT spend growth. 38% of survey execut expect an 11% increas in network spend next year, while 59% expect a 6% increase. Cowen point out that these number aren't quit as strong as in it May 2016 survey, but they still point to solid network spend growth in 2017.Cisco also came up in the survey questions, and the result paint a pictur that conflict with the company' gloomi outlook. Thirty-f percent of execut plan to spend more with Cisco in 2017, while 36% expect to spend the same amount, and just 3% expect to spend less. When ask which vendor they current use for ""digit initiatives,"" Cisco wa the respons 62% of the time.Th Cowen analyst sum up the result of the survey: ""Undercut what appear to be the wide held view among investor of the immin demis of Networking, respons to our 4Q16 IT Survey indic a rel favor outlook for the Network industri in gener and for CSCO in particular.""What to watch in 2017Cisco' switch and rout busi -- the core of the compani that account for 45% of revenu dure fiscal 2016 -- have been volatil in recent quarters. Switch revenu wa flat in fiscal 2016, with some up quarter and some down quarters, and rout revenu slump 4%.Imag source: Cisco Systems.Neith is realli a growth busi at thi point, but the survey result suggest that both busi could produc some growth in 2017. Thi come at a good time - two of Cisco' smaller growth businesses, data center and collaboration, hit a wall dure the first quarter. Both segment suffer a 3% year-over-year revenu decline, rais some question about their abil to drive growth for the compani go forward.What Cowen call ""digit initiatives"" in the survey like encompass mani things, but secur may be the most import for Cisco. The company' secur busi continu to grow at a double-digit pace, in part driven by acquisitions. With demand for cybersecur expect to grow briskli in the come years, Cisco is in great posit to benefit.Whil the result of Cowen' survey don't guarante that Cisco will have a great 2017, they provid a data point that should make Cisco investor a littl less concern about the company' lacklust outlook.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) wa hit with a recent setback that' reminisc of it choppi ride in the second half of the year. On Wednesday, feder court juror in San Jose, California hand a victori to fierc CSCO rivalArista Network Inc(NYSE:ANET). Accord to a Reuter report, CSCO wa seek $335 million in damag due to ""copyright infringementof it user interfaces.""However, juror were not convinc that Cisco' uniqu user interfac technolog were develop sole as a result of the company' creativity.Instead, Arista' attorney success defend against CSCO by deploy the ""scene a faire"" argument.makeArticleAd();Thi state that, in certain circumstances, an idea cannot be express unless it incorpor specif elements. These element then no longer have the tradit copyright protect of exclusivity. Not surprisingly, Cisco stock absorb a small loss of valu follow the verdict.Mor so than the actual impact of the lawsuit is it implications. As note by InvestorPlac writer Tom Taulli, thebiggest challeng face Cisco stock is competition. In the company' primari network business, the compani face industri giant such asJunip Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) andHewlett Packard Enterpris Co(NYSE:HPE). Wors yet, the pool of potenti CSCO custom is shrink asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) are develop their own network solutions.A to be expected, the big boy have taken their toll fundament on Cisco stock. The technolog compani took a sizabl blow in it hardwar and router busi for the most recent quarter. Switch to other sector hasn't alway result in consist success, either. Even there, industri such as network secur are domin by firm likePalo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW) andFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT). No matter which way it goes, CSCO stock will face a tough road.10 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy for 2017Cisco Stock Ha the Right StuffThat said, no compani is guarante an easi path. Even if a busi is flourish today, competit is onli right around the corner. Sinc digit network isn't exactli a proprietari function, the next best thing for an investor is to find a financi sturdi player. There' go to be a lot of tumbles, as the recent verdict demonstrates, but Cisco stock is one of those name that' built like a linebacker.Thi simpli mean that CSCO stock can take it just as much as it can dish it. There' a lot to like in thebal sheet- rise cash levels, control inventory, and invest in physic infrastructure. That tell me that manag is seriou about strategi and vision, provid confid for long-term holder of Cisco stock. Also, CSCO ha excel free cash flow, so the administr aspect of the busi is about as close to worry-fre as you can get.I'm especi impress by Cisco' financi discipline. Profit margin continu to lead the industry, and are well in line with histor averages. Too mani time in the broader tech sector we see organ that are do rel well today, but poorli against prior results. Thi is not so with Cisco stock. Becaus of thi discipline, share are also undervalu against trail earnings.Should You Buy CSCO Stock?Bas on the fundamentals, CSCO stock look like an incred buy. While the network icon is have a great 2016 - share are up 13% year to date - Wall Street consensu isn't quit so enthusiastic. Yes, the major ofcov analyst are bullishon Cisco stock, but, there' a sizabl number with ""hold"" ratings. For the fence-sitters, they view the $30 level as technic resistance. Indeed, share onli got into troubl thi year after it breach thi level.Understandably, that' no confid boost.However, let' consid a few facts. The averag price of Cisco stock in 1999 - just befor it went ballist in the 2000 tech bubbl - wa $27.77.From 2001-2007, the averag price drop to $17.49. Thi year, CSCO stock ha larg trade abov $28. So, bear in mind that when the issu of ""technic resistance"" come up it' an arbitrari comparison. The bigger pictur show that the Cisco stock ralli is seriou business.I'm also love the fact that in the current decad we have seen three double-digit annual return for CSCO stock, inclus of thi year. That achiev match what we saw in the entir 2000' decade. But, the context is even more important.10 ""Best of the Best"" Stock to Buy for 2017In the past decade, those monster return succeed monster losses. Thi time around, none of the double-digit perform follow neg returns. In other words, thi is a sustain rally, not a reactionari one.Now we have to set expect straight - I doubt that Cisco stock is go to make you rich overnight. It' an industri giant in a competit and satur environment. But, thi is exactli what make CSCO stock compelling. No one' go to play nice in tech.

The 3 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors in 2017,12/20/2016,"Imag source: Getti Images.Th stock market can sometim feel a bit overwhelm for begin investors. There are more than 7,000 differ equiti to choos from across a varieti of sectors, and each ha it own uniqu set of risk and catalysts.However, one of the veri few constant that' held up over the long run, and which begin investor can take comfort in, is thatdividend stockstend to outperform non-dividend-pay stocks. Think about it thi way: the onli compani that are usual go to share a percentag of their profit with sharehold are those with sound busi model that have withstood the test of time, as well as compani that expect to grow, or at least retain their competit advantage. In a way, dividend stock are beacon of success for begin investor to follow.makeArticleAd();Of course, that isn't all. Dividend can help to hedg the impact of the stock market' inevit corrections, and they can also be reinvest back into share of more dividend-pay stock via Dividend Reinvest Plans, or DRIPs. Thi repeat pattern of buy more stock with your dividend payout and thusli receiv a larger dividend dure the next payout is a trick the smartest investor on Wall Street use to get rich.So where' a new investor to begin? My suggest would be to consid the follow threebest dividend stocksin 2017.Imag source: Getti Images.Johnson & JohnsonIt' certainli not go to wow investor with double-digit growth anymore, but healthcar conglomerateJohnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) ha everyth you'd look for in a top dividend stock for a begin investor.Th most attract compon of Johnson & Johnson is it busi diversity. It' compos of more than 250 subsidiaries, make divest and acquisit easier to incorpor without disrupt the larger business, and it ha three primari revenu channels, each with it own purpose:Consum health product is a slower-growth segment, but J&J' brand-nam health product are usual inelast and maintain strong price power. Thus, J&J' health product segment tend to gener consist and predict cash flow.Med devic have grown slower of late, like a result of increas competit in the devic space. However, an age America that' live longer than ever is bound to need an increas amount of prevent care via hip, knee, and spine procedur in the year to come, set up J&J for success.Pharmaceut are the ice on the cake for J&J as it brand drug provid most of it oper margin. Between 2009 and mid-2014, Johnson & Johnson brought 14 novel medicin to market, half of which have gone on to gener $1 billion-plu in annual sales. Manag believ anoth 10 blockbust drug can be brought to market (or at least have new drug applic file with the Food and Drug Administration) by 2019.Johnson & Johnson is current sit on nearli $41 billion in cash and cash equivalents, boast one of just two AAA credit rate from Standard & Poor' for all publicli trade compani (the highest credit rate given by S&P), and ha a 54-year streak of increas it payout, put it among truli elit company. J&J' 2.8% yield is nice abov the averag yield for theS&P 500, make it one of the best dividend stocks, and least volatil investments, for begin investors.Imag source: Pixabay.NextEra EnergyAnoth great dividend stock for begin investor to consid isNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) in the util sector.Electr util stock are often a great place to start for both income-seek investor and begin investor becaus they deal with an inelast product: electricity. If you own a home, rent an apartment, or run a business, you need electricity. With the except of be unabl to control Mother Nature, electr usag and regulatori price increas make cash flow and profit somewhat predict -- and trust me, Wall Street and investor love when there aren't ani surprises.However, NextEra Energi doesn't have too much in common with your standard util company. Wherea most electr util have onli begun to recogn the benefit of altern energies, NextEra ha been embrac them for more than a decade. NextEra Energi and it affili are the largest provid of renew energi from the wind and sun in the world. Not to mention it also is one of the largest oper of commerci nuclear power with the capac to gener more than 6.4 GW of emissions-fre electricity, which is enough to power almost 5 million households.NextEra Energy' focu on go green is critic for a number of reasons. To begin with, though the expens of focus on renew energi is costli upfront, NextEra' electricity-gener cost are probabl go to be a lot lower five or 10 year from now than nearli all of it peer which could be scrambl to instal wind and solar platforms. Secondly, it put NextEra ahead of the curv when it come to reduc it carbon emissions. Should the U.S. Environment Protect Agenc choos to tighten emiss regul in the year or decad to come, NextEra will be prepared. Lastly, it high usag of wind and solar mean lower long-term cost for the consumer, which probabl mean a happier customer.NextEra like ha the potenti to grow it profit by between 5% and 9% annual through the end of the decade, which, when combin with it 2.9% dividend yield, could make it one of the best dividend stock for begin investor to own.Imag source: Getti Images.Cisco SystemsOn of the best dividend stock begin investor can consid buy from the technolog sector is network giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) .Like all stocks, Cisco System ha it imperfections. Innov within the technolog space move rapidly, and from time to time Cisco ha had to ramp up it spend to seemingli catch up with the next innov wave. We'r begin to see Cisco' invest realli pay off. For instance, in August Cisco announc that it wa go to elimin 5,500 job in it tradit switch and router division, which it primarili suppli to enterpris custom and telecom carriers, and it invest the ""savings"" into faster-grow softwar segments, such as security, cloud-computing, and the Internet of Things, all of which have long-term double-digit growth potential. Dure the first quarter of fiscal 2017, secur revenu wound up increas 11% year over year.However, investor don't have to throw Cisco' legaci busi out with the bathwat just yet. Even though it' make the move into software, it' still a domin player in network equip (switch and routing), which is noth to sneez at. Asnot by my Foolish colleagu Tim Green, Cisco had north of 60% market share in the switch market, accord to IDC, in 2015. Comparatively, there aren't ani other manufactur abov 9% market share, leav Cisco as the brand-nam hardwar compani in the network space. And it' still health profit on these products.But if there' one thing Cisco' domin bring to the tabl everi year, it' lot of free cash flow. Earlier thi year Cisco announc a $15 billion share buyback and onc again increas it dividend (bi 24% thi go-around). Current yield 3.4%, Cisco is in prime posit to benefit income-seek investor and those begin investor who are terrifi of risk and want to own brand-nam companies.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should You Buy Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) in 2017?,12/19/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsFor a bore company,Cisco System Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) gener a lot of heat among analysts.Ov half it analyst current rate the stocka buy, but JPMorgan say CSCO is ina ""tough spot,""amid below-averag growth and rise interest rates.makeArticleAd();Which side is right? Well, both, actually.Lik some other tech companies, such asIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM), Cisco ha been execut a turn thi decad from be a growth stock to a yield play. It initi a dividend in 2011 at six cent per share, but that' now up to 26 cents, yield 3.4%.CSCO shares, while up 71% over the past five years, trail the 85% gain in the S&P 500 dure that period. Buy Cisco for growth, in short, ha becom a bad play, but those who bought it for yield have done well.7 Big Tech Stock to Buy for Dow 20,000The Open ThreatLikeOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL), which ha been disappoint the Street in recent earn announcements, Cisco face a threat from open source. In it case, the threat come in the form of the Open Comput Project (OCP), origin launch byFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) to reduc the cost of build cloud data centers. Hardwar is becom software, and even special piec of hardware, like switches, are becom virtual.Whenev CEO Chuck Robbin address the media or analysts, he is ask about the OCP, and hi answer is alway the same. It' a threat on the low end, not on the high end;it' not an either-or but both.Whil that answer is accurate, it underestim the long-term threat. Virtual is make all sort of hardwar into software. Custom chip and proprietari softwar may be necessari in some markets, but the industry' mega-trend is keep switch margin down, even while formal competit is reduced, and that is not changing.Cisco is slowli lose it niche.Seek New MarketsAwar of the threat, Cisco is seekingleadership in new markets.Sinc 2012, Cisco ha made dozen ofacquisit in comput securityto develop it ""Secur Everywhere"" strategy. Most, likeCloudLock, bought in June, focu on the cloud, where Cisco need to shore up margin against the OCP threat, give switch custom someth to buy while it still ha them. It revenu from secur isris at double-digit rates, even while total revenu remain stable.Cisco ha been continu develop an Internet of Thing strategy, spend $1.4 billion earlier thi year onJasp Technologiesfor it cloud-bas IoT platform. Over time, monitor product and compon will becom bigger Internet market than people, and thi is suppos to keep Cisco grow beyond next year.Th problem is that other mainlin compani such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) are do the same thing, and older cybersecur firm such asSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) are also going""up the stack""with acquisit aim at the cloud and other complex systems.Whil Cisco' high-end switch were uniqu earli in thi century, briefli make CSCO the most valuabl compani in the world, the world ha sinc changed. Cisco' strategi of build secur collabor with subscription-bas softwar revenuei not unique, and it will have to undergo largelayoffsto keep margin up in it core business.10 ""Best of the Best"" Stock to Buy for 2017The Bottom LineCisco is neither go to collaps nor break out in 2017. It yield is go to look smaller as interest rate rise. While the dividend remain affordable, usual cover more than twice over by earnings, and a lower stock price would automat rais that yield, that' not much of an argument to buy CSCO stock.Hav Cisco in your portfolio won't burn you, but the compani will not burn up the track, either.

The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $25 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of 81 cents. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 3.2% return against the $25 commitment, or a 3.9% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to CSCO' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems, Inc. see it share fall 18.8% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $24.19 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the 81 cent from $25), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 3.9% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annual 3.9% figur actual exce the 3.4% annual dividend paid by Cisco Systems, Inc., base on the current share price of $30.77. And yet, if an investor wa to buy the stock at the go market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downsid becaus the stock would have to fall 18.75% to reach the $25 strike price.Alway import when discuss dividend is the fact that, in general, dividend amount are not alway predict and tend to follow the up and down of profit at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems, Inc., look at the dividend histori chart for CSCO below can help in judg whether the most recent dividend is like to continue, and in turn whether it is a reason expect to expect a 3.4% annual dividend yield.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the Octob 2017 expiration, for sharehold of Cisco Systems, Inc.

Sell the cover call at the $32 strike and collect the premium base on the $1.47 bid, annual to an addit 5.7% rate of return against the current stock price (thi is what we at Stock Option Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 9.1% annual rate in the scenario where the stock is not call away. Ani upsid abov $32 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but CSCO share would have to climb 4% from current level for that to occur, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 8.8% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Cisco Systems, Inc., highlight in green where the $25 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $32 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the Octob 2017 put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

"Should I Buy Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",12/15/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) ha been a flop as a long-term investment. For the past decade, the return ha been an aw 11%. But lately, the CSCO stock price ha been get some mojo. In fact, the return for thi year is the same as for the past 10 years!Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)Not that the company' CEO, Chuck Robbins, came on board in the summer of 2015 and ha not wast much time in make some big changes, such as with divest non-cor asset and invest more aggress in growth market like cloud comput and mobile. All in all, there are sign that these move are gain traction.makeArticleAd();Th competit environ remain intense, however, and Cisco stock is feel the pressur on the company' main network business. It' not exactli easi to make the transit from hardwar to software.That mean Cisco stock could be a valu or a risk right now. To see, here' a look at the pro and cons:Cisco Stock ProsTransformation: A key part of the growth strategi ha been aggress buying. It help that the compani ha a long histori of dealmaking. In other words, the compani know how to spot opportun as well as integr divers cultures. There are also the critic advantag of Cisco' global custom base, strong sale organ and trust brand, especi when deal with mission-crit technologies.Th 7 Best Monthli Dividend Stock for 2017Yet thi doe not impli that the core network busi will somehow not be an import driver. If anything, the long-term prospect still look bright. Accord to Cisco' research, the amount of mobil traffic is forecast to surg byeight time from 2015 to 2020, repres a 53% compound annual growth rate. Some of the factor includ mega-trend like stream video, artifici intelligence, virtual realiti and the Internet of Things.Although, Cisco ha been adapt to the swift chang in the market. To thi end, the compani is focus more on software-bas approach and also subscript busi models.Strong Financials: CSCO continu to show disciplin with it costs. Dure the summer, the compani announc a7% reductionin the workforce, translat into about 5,500 jobs. So yes, CSCO ha continu to be a nice cash generator. For the latestquarter, oper cash flow came to $2.7 billion. In all, there is $71 billion in the bank. Someth about this: $61 billion of that amount is in foreign accounts. That is, if Donald Trump pass legisl for lower tax to repatri capit - which seem like a pretti good bet - thi will certainli be good news for holder of Cisco stock. The compani will be abl to use the resourc for acquisitions, share buyback and higher dividend payouts.Valuation: Cisco stock look like a good value. Consid that the forward price-earn ratio is onli about 12. Oh, and when subtract out the cash, the multipl is a mere 6. By comparison, the forward P/E ratio forMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is 19 andOracl Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) sport a multipl of 14 time earnings. Finally, CSCO ha a decent dividend yield of 3.4%.Cisco Stock ConsCompetition: Cisco must fight tough rival in variou markets. In the secur space alone, there are standout oper likePalo Alto NetworksInc(NYSE:PANW) andFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT). But perhap the biggest competit threat is to the core network business. There are the long-tim U.S. companies, such asJunip Networks, Inc.(NYSE:JNPR) andHewlett Packard Enterpris Co(NYSE:HPE), as well as next-gen firm likeArista Network Inc(NYSE:ANET). At the same time, CSCO must fight againstHuaweiand other low-cost Chines firms.Yet there is anoth import factor: Cisco' potenti custom becom competitors! To lower cost and improv performance, mega tech compani likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) have been build their own network technologies.Lumpi of Revenues:Cisco sell to mani larg enterpris custom across the world. While thi mean that purchas order are gener larg and have long terms, there is alway the risk of deal fall through or be delayed. Actually, if there are even minor snags, the impact on revenu can be significant. Interestingli enough, thi happen dure the latestquarter. The compani gave a tepid outlook, with a forecast of revenu expect to fall by 2% to 4% in the current quarter. CSCO indic that, yes, larg network servic provid custom have been pull back on orders.Growth: For a compani at the scale of CSCO, it is natur for the top line to be fairli moderate. The problem is that - for some time - the growth path ha been meager. As note above, a key factor is that the core network busi is under pressur from the competition. Dure the latestquarter, the revenu from switch hardwar fell 7% and there wa a 6% drop in the router segment. But even in the more promis categori there are troublesom issues. In the latest quarter, the cloud-bas collabor busi suffer a 3% declin in revenu and even the wireless gear segment wa off by 5%.Then again, CSCO manag may be have difficulti in manag the complex of divers businesses. In other words, it may make sens for the compani to think about focus on a smaller number of operations.Bottom Line on Cisco StockAgain, Cisco face some tough challenges. But it is import to keep in mind that turnaround take time. As Robbin note in theQ1 report: ""You have to look at it over time, and not just quarter to quarter.""Besides, Cisco is bet on the right markets, such as cloud comput and mobile. In fact, there are alreadi indic that the secur segment could be a key driver. In the latest quarter, revenu jump by 11%. Then again, CSCO ha been smart to build secur featur into it network systems.Whi Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Will Win Big With WaymoFinally, the valuat on Cisco stock is attract and so is the dividend - and cash flow should remain substantial.So for investor look for a stabl play in the tech sector, the pro outweigh the cons.Tom Taulli run the InvestorPlac blogIPO Playbookand is a regist invest advis repres (you canvisit hi siteto learn more about hi financi plan services).H is also the author of variou book on invest like All About Commodities, All About Short Sell and High-Profit IPO Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Disrupt refer to how smaller, nimbler organ can introduc new product and servic that overthrow larger, more establish competitors.

For those who haven't read it, yet, whi did you write thi book and what wa the overview that you'r get at with it?Christensen:Well, it' someth that I have seen in my life, and especi as I'v tri to help peopl be better managers. Everi time we put a new [product] into the market, we think that our product will be successful. We'v done a lot of studi of the market and figur out what the competitor are and everyth else. So everi time we put a product into the market, we think it will be successful.But the realiti is that nearli 80% of those product that we think will be success fail financi in the market, so I [wondered] if innov is intrins unpredictable. [That] you have to roll the dice mani time in order to get a few wins, but you can't predict which number will come up on top. Or [whether there is] some other explan for the unpredict that we see.And what we decid is the way peopl like me teach our student [at busi schools] how to think of the structur of market [means] we'v creat the problem ourselves, and we conclud that unpredict is not inher to innovation. We can actual be success much more frequent than we thought.So that wa where the question came from, originally, and the reason whi we gave it thi title,Compet Against Luck. That most of us think that innov entail compet against luck, but we don't think that that necessarili is the case.Erickson:Clay, in the book you said it' a book you'v been write for the past 20 years, just in think about the busi world. We know that you'v spent a career mold the theori of disruption. I want to ask how your thought about disrupt innov [have] chang over the past two decades.Christensen:Well, they'v chang a lot, and I'm glad that they did. You know, never ha a good theori just emerg in a perfect state from the person who develop it at the beginning. It' almost alway [that] a theori at the begin [is] half-bak and incomplete. The way a theori get to have power is that peopl who read and use it have to find anomali or thing that the theori can't explain. And the onli way the theori get better is if the peopl who are the author of the theori are will to accept the anomali as an opportun to improv it.So that' what we did. Some of the anomali [were] point out to us by other academ like us; but by far the most use one have been from our MBA student here at HBS. I teach a cours that' broadli regarded, and I [tell] the student [the following], as they prepar for a case (becaus we do it all by the case method).I say, ""You'v got three assign to prepar for everi case. The first one is there' a theori that we use in everi session of everi class, and these are theori about manag that emerg from our work or the work of others.""And then the second is, ""You have a case, and I want you to put the theori on like a set of lens and examin today' case. The question is can you explain whi and how thi compani got in the situat that it' in through the len of that theory? And then, given that, what doe the theori say the manag ought to do to resolv the problem?""Then the third one is, ""I want you to come to class prepar to tell Clay Christensen what' wrong with thi theory.""And so that way, year after year, day after day, more than 100 student [turn] their brain around to show Clay what it can't explain. And I'm realli grate to them that they took it seriously, and they realli were tri to find out what the theori can't explain. So as a consequence, the theori of disrupt and the theori of job to be done, and a few others, realli are much better as a result of [have gone] through thi crucible.Erickson:Ar there certain things, Clay, which keep come up? You said that student were alway [asking] what' wrong, or how can the initi theori of disrupt [be changed]. Are there certain theme that continu came up in your class?Christensen:Yes. Veri often they would come up with an exampl of an industri that didn't get disrupted. Ha not ever been disrupted. And mayb the question is [whether] the theori onli [applies] to a few situations. For example, hotel for mani year have just never been disrupted. Holiday Inn come up in the 1950 at the low end of everi market, but 40 year later, the Holiday Inn ha not move upmarket. The corpor bought Crown Plaza and part of other busi at differ point in the constel of hotels, but the Holiday Inn, itself, still is at the bottom of the market. And in a similar way, higher educ hasn't been disrupt and we just couldn't explain it.And then as we work with a coupl of our student for their paper, we realiz that in describ the theori of disruption, I had alway assum that the trajectori of perform improv that innov compani provid [means] they keep introduc better and better products. I assum that it alway had the same trajectori or slope. And it turn out that everi market ha a differ trajectori of improv [and so I did some studies].Th first studi about disrupt [center on] the disk drive market and boy, technolog move at a rapid rate in that market. So a compani would come in at the bottom of the market and in about eight year they'r in the top. I describ that market as a place where [00:09:39]. Their whole life wa measur in a few years.But then I [reviewed] our studi of the steel industry, where the mini-mil came in at the bottom of the market. It took about 50 year for the industri to get turn upsid down. And so the rate of technolog chang ha a big impact on how long an industri will go without be disrupted.Then we realiz that in hotel and higher education, the trajectori of technolog improv ha been zero. There just weren't ani new busi model that have occurred. And then we realiz that oh, my gosh, but wait a minute. Airbnb in hotel is an innov and a new busi model, and they veri rapidli have disrupt a signific chunk of hotels. And onlin learning, in a similar way, is a new busi model [and] in just a few year it' turn upsid down higher educ in mani ways.So we realiz that when we see disrupt not occur in an industry, the result of that is the impact of technolog chang differ industri by industry, and it isn't the case that it happen in some industri and not in others; but rather, it occur when [the pace of] technolog progress changes.Erickson:I'l follow that up, perhaps, with a question about competition, becaus you say that the pace of chang differ in differ industries, but the invest commun ha typic look at the incumb (the compani that have the highest margin or the strongest cash flows) as a sign of a competit advantag against others.But then from a lot of your research, we'v seen sever of these compani are the same one that get disrupted, whether [it' Eastman Kodak, Cisco, [or] whoever it might be, becaus of those market shift and then competit come in. How can we tell if a competit advantag is actual sustainable?Christensen:Ther are two ways, and the most import is that the theori of disrupt predict that if you have an incumb leader and an entrant compani want to attack them, if that entrant compani tri to attack them head-on by win the best custom of the establish leaders, the theori say that the incumb are go to turn around and tri to beat off the entrant and use it resourc in power way to beat the entrants.And the theori say that in almost everi case, the incumb win when an entrant tri to win through what we call sustain innovations, and sustain innov make good product better. And if somebodi come in at the bottom of the market with a product that is so much more afford and access that a whole differ popul of peopl can now have access to and use a product that histor wa beyond their reach, almost alway the incumb leader fail.And it ha noth to do with the power of the incumb or with a lack of power of the entrant; but rather the incumb leader don't want to go after it. That' the essenc of disruption. And so your question is answer by disruption.Erickson:Yes, it does. It sound like the competit advantag of an incumb for sustain innov can't realli be understood against a disrupt compani that' play at the lower end [use a] differ valu in the industry, right?Christensen:That' right, and it is veri predictable. And what' interesting, in the question that you asked, is whi do investor not get it?Erickson:Right.Christensen:And it' a veri interest question. My son Matthew and I found an invest compani call Rose Park Advisors. It' been oper for about 12 years, now, where we invest in just publicli trade companies. But the polici is if it' disruptive, we buy their stock, and if they are the incumb and an entrant goe after them, we'll short them occasionally. The greater return on that portfolio for 12 years, now, is 36% on a compound annual rate of return, and without ani short or hedg (occasion we short), but it' not hedg or leveraged. But 36% compound annual rate of return.Erickson:That' incredible.Christensen:And the abil to do that is known. We publish everything. But investor seem to be a littl bit arrogant, I think, and not humbl to listen to an academ theori in practice.Erickson:I think it' veri interest when you think about the concept of competit moat like Warren Buffett ha describ for decades, versu Jeff Bezo say your margin is my opportunity. Most of the compani that are captur all that valu are the one that are destin to be in the sight of disrupt competitors, right?Christensen:No, that' right. And I mention there' anoth type of innov in which the incumb can succeed, and that is when the compani follow [the job to be done in thi new book that we published]. And when the incumb leader ha organ himself around develop product to get a job done for customers, it' veri hard for incumb to win that game; becaus in mani way it make disrupt imposs to accomplish. So that' whi we wrote the book. It took us, as you mentioned, 20 years, but we final were confid that what we were say wa true.Erickson:I want to highlight that a littl bit - the job to be done - becaus that' one of the real theme of compet against luck in your book. Custom are hire those compani to perform job that lead to progress for them. Anoth thing the invest commun ha typic done is categor companies, whether it' base on industry, or sell product that are of a similar function. But base on thi job to be done theory, and the research you'v done, do you think there' a more effect way for compani to realli defin their own market and then also their competitor's?Christensen:Oh, absolutely. I think that the way you describ it is exactli right - that the way manag and investor think of the structur of market is the world is structur by product, category, or custom category. Except that that' not the way that [the world] appear to a customer.Rath what happen - the way the world appear to a custom - is everi day, darn it, stuff happen to them. Some job that aris in our live are just little, increment job that happen to us everi day, and other are dramatic, breakthrough innovations. But when a job arriv in our lives, it forc us to go out and find something, or buy something, or use someth to get the job done. And understand the job is what' critical.So it' a silli example. Here I am talk to you. I'm 64 year old, unfortunately, and I'm 6'8"" tall, unfortunately. I marri a wonder wife, fortunately. The youngest of our five children, Katy, went to Columbia, unfortunately. And I have all other characterist and attribut about myself.But none of my characterist or attribut have yet caus me to pick upTh New York Timestoday. Now, there might be a correl between my characterist and the propens that I would have to buyTh New York Times. Those characterist don't caus me to do that, nor do our characterist and attribut caus us to buy ani product or service.But rather what caus us to buy someth is we have job to do, and when we have a job, we'v got to find a product that get the job done. And it' understand [what the job is] that allow you to har the causal mechan behind that choice. That' whi we decid predict wa so import to focu on, becaus if you har the causal mechan around a choice, you can predict the futur quit well. Do you want me to give you an example?Erickson:Sure.Christensen:Th third of our five children, Michael, unfortun went to Stanford to get a Ph.D. a few year ago, and after he had been there for about a week, he call us up and said, ""Mom and Dad, I found my apart and I need to furnish my apart tomorrow."" And what had happen for Michael is he realiz he ha a job to do, and that is he need to furnish [his] apart tomorrow.So I'll ask you, Simon. When I describ for you thi job that Michael had to do (that he furnish the apart tomorrow), is there a place where you could go to buy what they'r sell to get that job done?Erickson:Sure.Christensen:Wher would you go to get the job done?Erickson:Oh, I would tri to find whoever ha got the best poster of the colleg I'm go to, if I'm at Stanford, someth right by the univers that' close and that ha everyth that you need, as quickli as possible.Christensen:And what compani would that be?Erickson:Oh, I believ that you refer toIkeaa coupl of time as that company, right?Christensen:Sure, becaus it' organ around that particular job to be done. And the reason I refer to it is becaus anybodi who' thought about their live realiz that that name pop into their mind and they have never been disrupted. In fact Ikea ha been roll it busi model out around the world for 50 years, and nobodi ha disrupt them.And it' not that they have ani secrets, and it' not that there' no money in it. Their owner is the third richest guy in the world, and yet they have no competition. And the reason is that everybodi els that sell furnitur is organ around type of furniture. And if I want to compet against those guys, I just have to make better product than they do.But Ikea is organ around the job to be done, and if you do it in that way, then you can describ all of the experi - in purchase, in use - that Ikea provid in order to nail that job perfectly. And becaus they organ themselv in a veri uniqu and complic way, it' veri hard for competitor to compet with them. So that' just an exampl of my think about the market in term of the job to be done rather than product as a use distinction.Erickson:And Clay, you refer to a lot of those compani as purpos brands, correct? The compani that becom just synonym with those jobs. Whether it' Ikea, or TurboTax, or Starbucks, it' the compani that immedi when I think of it, I think of whi I would go to that company, and it' immedi appar in my head, right?Christensen:Absolut right. Absolut right. V8 Juice.Disney(NYSE: DIS) . There are realli import one all around you, when you look at it.Erickson:Back to the mention you had of correl versu causality. We'r kind of in the buzzword age of big data and artifici intelligence, right now...Christensen:Yes...Erickson:...wher you'v got tech that can quantit search through a ton of data. It' tri to find correl between those input factors, but it seem like it miss the qualit aspect that you'v describ of what the job is to be done, or what it is a custom want to hire me to do. Is there some way that we could be use big data more effectively?Christensen:That' a great question, and as you probabl know, it bother me a lot that peopl can think that they can dispens with think and simpli have somebodi els develop an algorithm that will provid the answer. I think a much better way is to put data asid for a minut and tri to figur out what causal is. And you can't look at causal - you can't observ causal - when you'v got 200,000 point of data in a database.And [in] the case [of] physic sciences, biolog sciences, and manag science, to observ thing you have to look at an N of 1. And if you can explain what happen in that N of 1, then you can tri to explain what happen when the N is two and grow it that way. And data can be veri valuabl if you use it to valid or show anomali to a theory.But the data doesn't yield the theori itself. The develop of a theori come from an N of 1, and then the valid of the theory, or identifi anomali to the theori is where data occur that can be useful. And so big data, to me, [has] noth big about it. That' the wrong categor scheme.Erickson:It sound like we have the wrong buzzword for big data. It should be go back to small data.Christensen:Yes, I think that' exactli right.Erickson:Clay, one of the other thing you talk about in the book is organiz structure. You point out a studi done by, I believe, Bain Consulting, [which show that] two-third of corpor reorgan are actual destroy valu and not accomplish what they intend to do.Christensen:Uh-huh.Erickson:Whi is it that busi are so bad at reorging?Christensen:Boy, that' a great question. To me, the answer is there' a differ between interdepend and modular in the architectur of systems. Some architectur are interdependent; that is, if you chang one thing, it affect the way all of the other element of the system have to change, as well. You have to do everyth in order to do anything. And if you chang one thing, you have to chang everything, so you have to understand the whole system.And a modular system is one which each compon interfac with the other compon in standard ways. And when you have a modular system, it' real easi to map that architectur onto an org chart that you can stick up on a wall, becaus somebodi ha to be respons for [everi component]: for make it, and design it, and manufactur it, and test it, and replenish it, and so on. So the organiz chart on the wall reflect the architectur of the product or service. And when you chang the org chart, you have to develop a differ modular architectur so that peopl can snap the piec togeth in a differ way.In a product that is interdependent, then an org chart almost alway creat more problem than they resolve, becaus if you chang one thing, you have to chang everything. And I think the key reason for your question (whi [organizational] chang elimin more valu than [they create]) is manag don't take the time to understand the natur of the interdepend of what they'r tri to implement. It' a complic problem.Erickson:[I a fair summari of that], then, that market and product chang perhap faster than organiz structur does?Christensen:Yes, that' a great way to frame it. That' a great way to frame it.Erickson:Yes, a great point. And the last question befor I'd like to get in a game of Buy, Sell and Hold with you, Clay. The last question befor that, though, is our audienc at The Motley Fool is primarili individu investors. You mention a bit about your investing, and I wonder if there were specif thing that you look for when you'r buy stock or you invest in companies. Are there certain attribut that you person are look for as an investor?Christensen:Th answer is yes. Number one, are they disruptive?Erickson:I'm not surpris by that.Christensen:Becaus if you invest in disrupt companies, they move up upmarket in veri predict ways. The analyst don't understand that, and so a disrupt compani surpris the investor over and over again - that there is more growth in the product or that compani than they thought.Becaus what the analyst see at the bottom of the market is products, and they don't realiz there' a trajectori of improv over time that surpris the investor over and over again. And so, that' the way you defin what is disruptive. It start at the bottom [and] they move up. And the analyst are too arrogant. They don't understand the theory, and so they'r surpris over and over again.And in a similar way, if you focu on [invest in] compani that are organ around a job to be done, they can be the incumb in an industry, but they can't be disrupt becaus they'r provid all the experi that custom need to have. They can't be disrupted. So those are two rule that we follow when we make investments.Erickson:OK. Clay, befor we let you go, we have to have a littl bit of fun. We want to spot you up with game of Buy, Sell, or Hold.Christensen:Al right.Erickson:Not talk specif companies, but I'm go to throw you a coupl of concept in a lightn round kind of format where you can conceptu buy, sell, or hold them base on your level of convict in their futur relevance. So larger role in the futur is a buy, less of a role is a sell, and more data (you don't realli know) is a hold. Are you ready?Christensen:Tel me those rule again.Erickson:So a buy would be you are veri bullish on thi concept in the future.Christensen:Buy, sell, hold. OK.Erickson:Ar you ready?Christensen:Yup.Erickson:Top one. Buy, sell, or hold in the big data era compani continu to use small focu group for market research?Christensen:Buy.Erickson:Whi is that?Christensen:Becaus I alreadi gave the answer to that question.Erickson:Yes, fair enough on that. Topic two. Buy, sell, or hold account care organ and just organ that focu more on outcom rather than procedur reimburs as a part of the US healthcar system?Christensen:I'd say hold. I'm not sure I could answer your question becaus the way you frame it, I think is not consist with itself. Account care organizations, overall, I would sell, becaus I don't think that they are organ in a way that help compani solv problem for customers. Sometim an account care organ collect develop enough clout that the bigger player can be bigger. But as a solut to healthcar problems, I'd pretti strongli give it a sell.Erickson:Next up, Clay. Buy, sell, or hold the futur of tradit four-year universities?Christensen:That' a sell.Erickson:Whi is that?Christensen:Includ the Harvard Busi School.Erickson:Th reason for that? [Are you thinking] more onlin learning? What' the direct you'r taking?Christensen:That' right. We have not spent ani energi at all tri to control the cost of higher education, and tuition ha increas at a faster rate than the cost of healthcare, for example. It is so expens that it is veri hard for a graduat student to get a job in an oper compani anymore, becaus oper compani can't pay the salari that our graduat student need in order to pay off their student loans. So our student have to take a job with ventur capitalists, or privat equiti shops, or consult firms. But oper compani can't hire peopl with a Harvard MBA. That' whi it' a sell.Erickson:Fair enough. The next one is buy, sell, or hold Uber?Christensen:Hold. Their model ha been a wonder model, and it' been [disrupt in the past], in that it busi model is hard for a taxi to put their arm around. But I think that model is understood, now, and it' not clear how mani other industri can be Uberized. There might be some, but there are lot of interdepend that I [still] need to think it through.Erickson:Well, I'll be look for ""uberize"" in the dictionary, becaus I'm pretti sure that' go to be a verb that' go to get a lot of attention.Christensen:No kidding.Erickson:Last one for you, Clay. Buy, sell, or hold the futur of digit currenc such as bitcoin?Christensen:That' a buy in a differ way than mani peopl think. The problem is that there is so much money around the world. The graduat of our busi school becom leader of larg corpor and they spend their energi on what we call effici innovation; that is, squeez more and more free cash flow out of the compani that they run. And as a result of that, there is just money everywhere, and the cost of money is essenti zero. So the essenc of what a bank histor ha been becom obviated, now, when the cost of capit is zero.So the veri concept of data - the differ definit of capit need to change. And I don't know what that is, but the bitcoin is a concept that I think is someth I would invest in.Erickson:Clayton Christensen is the Kim B. Clark Professor at Harvard Busi School. He' twice been name the world' most influenti busi thinker in a biennial rank conduct by Thinkers50 and he is the author of the recent bookCompet Against Luck. Clay, thi wa a lot of fun. Thank for be with us thi afternoon.Christensen:Oh, it' been fun to do it. Call me again. I like to keep buy and sell things.Erickson:That is the most fun we alway have, is with the game Buy, Sell, and Hold at the end.Christensen:Al right. Congratulations.Erickson:I realli enjoy it. Thank veri much, Clay.Christensen:You'r welcome.[End]Simon Ericksonown share of Netflix, Splunk, Starbucks, Veeva Systems, and Walt Disney.

Our 3 Favorite Stocks to Invest in the Internet of Things,12/12/2016,"Imag source: Getti Images.Th Internet of Thing (IoT) describ the grow network of connect sensor and devices, and the increas connect is alreadi have signific impact at the consumer, enterprise, and public levels. Research firmGartnerexpect the number of IoT devic to grow from 6.4 billion in 2016 to nearli 21 billion in 2020, and estim that more than half of new busi system and process will util the Internet of Thing by the end of that period. Growth in devic connect and machine-to-machin commun is creat an explos of new data, and thi inform is be sort and analyz to produc insight that can improv effici and drive substanti econom value.makeArticleAd();With the Internet of Thing trigger big shift in commerc and industry, some of the compani lead the push are pois to be major beneficiaries. In order to help investor ride the trend, we'v ask three Motley Fool writer to pick their top Internet of Thing stock. Read on to learn whyAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Verizon(NYSE: VZ) , andCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) made the list.Buy the network, not the devic makersBrian Feroldi(Verizon):There' no doubt that the Internet of Thing trend offer tremend growth opportun for all kind of tech companies. However, I person do not think that buy an electron hardwar manufactur is the right way to play the trend. The reason? Huge growth potenti will attract a lot of competition. Over time, that competit will erod away profit margins, leav investor with poor returns.For that reason, I think it is a far smarter idea to buy share of a cellular network provid like Verizon Commun instead. After all, those billion of devic that are expect to come onlin will need access to a mobil network in order to work. That provid Verizon with a great new avenu for growth in the year ahead.Y might not be awar of it, but Verizon is alreadi benefit from the IoT trend. Last quarter, Verizon' IoT revenu grew by 24% to $217 million, make it one of the company' fastest-grow divisions. Sure, that' still just a drop in the bucket when compar with the company' wireless and wirelin revenue, but over time IoT revenu hold promis to grow like wildfire. That could help propel the company' long-term revenu and profit growth.Verizon certainli believ that the IoT repres a huge opportunity, which is whi it is invest accordingly. Earlier thi year, Verizon bought Telog and Sensiti Systems, both of which will add to the company' IoT product offering. Over time I think investor should expect even more bolt-on acquisit to ensur that it maintain a strong foothold in thi import and grow market. Throw in a dividend yield that top 4.6% and I think Verizon is a great way for conserv investor to get their IoT exposure.An unlik leaderChri Neiger(Amazon.com):Th e-commerc giant probabl isn't the first compani you think about when talk about the Internet of Things, but I think it ha a few key advantag in the space.First, Amazon is alreadi a leader in the consum IoT space. It Echo speaker is pair with it robust virtual assistant, Alexa, to power everyth from turn on the sprinkler to order an Uber. Thi may not seem earth-shatt right now, but Amazon continu to open up Alexa to develop to connect the virtual assist to even more devic and tasks. As it doe that, I think it'll continu to lead in the house-autom space.Th second advantag is the company' Dash Replenish Servic (DRS). Thi built-in softwar allow home electron like wash machin to automat order more deterg from Amazon' websit when they notic that they'r run low. Autom is a key ingredi in the IoT, and Amazon is make thi a realiti and alreadi hasGener Electric,Samsung, andWhirlpoolon board. DR may take a while to take off, but as it doe you'll see Amazon lock custom -- and devic maker -- even further into it retail ecosystem.And last but not least, Amazon' true IoT opportun come from it cloud server business, Amazon Web Servic (AWS). It' no secret that Amazon' AW busi is booming, bring in $3.2 billion in the third quarter of thi year, and $11 billion over the past four quarters. And the compani is leverag that success for the IoT as well, by push it AW IoT platform. AW IoT allow develop to interact with connect devic and help them collect and analyz data. With so mani compani and develop alreadi use AW for their host needs, I think it'll be natur for them to migrat to AW IoT as more devic come online.Amazon' lead in the cloud-comput space, along with it own IoT platform, mean that the compani is pois to benefit from the nearli 50 billion IoT devic that will be onlin by 2020. Even if Amazon fail in the consum IoT space, it AW offer in the IoT space will benefit the compani for year to come.Own the compani that own the networkKeith Noonan(Cisco):Overcom secur and standard issu that aris from move data between dispar devic and network is one of the main obstacl to the evolut of connectivity, and no compani is better suit to deal with it than Cisco. The company' Internet of Thing and Applic Group vice president, Rowan Trollope, recent said that the compani can deliv mani of the connect and secur need brought on by IoT becaus ""it own the network."" There' some simplif involv in that statement, but Cisco' lead posit in network mean that the compani is go to have a form impact on the progress of IoT.Th compani is in the process of give devic maker tool and applications-program interfac to help with standard and to cut down on secur threat that could limit the progress of the tech. Cisco is take these step to get the big player on board with it network and certif process in order to facilit it transit to a more subscription-bas busi model. Thi year, the compani purchas Jasper Technolog for $1.4 billion in order to bolster it servic offer and fast-track it posit in IoT connect and analyt platforms.Th big connect push also present opportun that could lift Cisco' hardwar businesses. The network giant ha partner withEricsson,Intel, and Verizon for the develop of a 5G mobil router, and could benefit from demand for router and switch that are tailor for customers' IoT needs.Pric at just 12.5 time forward earn estimates, with roughli $40 billion in cash and short-term invest on the books, and a 3.5% dividend yield,Cisco stockoff an inexpens valuation, hefti return income, and a forefront posit in the Internet of Things.10 stock we like better than Verizon CommunicationsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bull of the Day: Acacia Communications (ACIA),12/12/2016,"CouldAcacia Communications(ACIA), the hottest IPO of 2016, still offer signific upsid in 2017?makeZacksArticleAd();Mani invest bank believ so. And I think the odd are pretti good too. That' whi I'm accumul share of Acacia over 45% off of it all-tim high abov $125.Thi maker of optic interconnect product for cloud infrastructur oper and content and commun servic provid -- think custom like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Verizon (VZ) and Germany' ADVA -- deliv it second earn report as a public compani in earli Novemb and the analyst welcom the outlook.Th consensu for 2017 EP shot up over 22% from $2.34 to $2.87, make it a Zack #1 Rank Strong Buy again.For a newli public compani like this, the analyst will be slow to rais expect too high until they get to know manag and the company' execut history. Sinc 2016 saw nearli 100% sale growth for Acacia, mani doubt thi can be repeat and so the consensu project right now is for 33% revenu growth.But at forward EP of $2.87, the stock is trade at under 25X. For 33% top line growth, that' growth at a veri reason price.And my sens is that sale will grow faster becaus Acacia' optic network product will be in high demand as the cloud buildout demand more 100G speed. The 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol is design to deliv data at 100 gigabit per second.Here' a chart of Acacia' rise to invest stardom sinc the May IPO around $30 and the subsequ 62% fall back to reality...Th Acacia OpportunityTh stock ha pull back quit a bit, but the growth stori is still intact. Let' look at five ""technical"" fact first as they tell their own stori of what the institut think of the fundamentals:1. Stock down over 25% sinc secondari of 4.5 million share that wa price at $100 -- when it wa trade $90! That wa BOLD!2. 180-day lockup expir wa Nov 9 and share have held $65-67 area, even after Nov 4 low of $61.80.3. Earn were Nov 10 and they certainli help support stock abov that $65-67 support area.4. Share test 62% retrac of $27 all-tim low (sinc May IPO) to the $128 all-tim high over the summer. I don't get precis with Fib and the market wasn't either, with the 62% RT in the mid-$60 and the recent low, dure the earli Novemb market swoon, at $61.80.5. Share ran to $79 in late Nov, then retest $65 in earli Dec for a nice bounceTh bottom line: A lot of big player probabl got hurt on the summer run-up abov $100 and into the secondari offering. The stock had been trade abov $100 from mid-August through Septemb when the secondari came.But my sens is that if anybodi wa still itch to sell befor or after the lockup expiration, they alreadi did. There is one more caveat on that front come up. Meanwhil take a look at the sale and earn estimates...Th Analyst Befor and After EarningsSever research analyst were busi upgrad the compani befor the secondari and they haven't chang their tune since.Bank of America restat a Buy rate and bump their PT from $88 to $130 in a research report on Septemb 5.Deutsch Bank rais their price target on Acacia from $90 to $125 and gave the stock a Buy rate in a research report on Septemb 9. They reiter their stanc on Nov 30.Needham & Compani rais their price target from $100 to $125 and gave the stock a Buy rate in a research report on Octob 11, right befor the secondary.

""We are maintain our expect for 30% revenu growth in 2017 while move 2018 growth to 20% from 17%."" They reiter their Outperform rating.Th CaveatTher is anoth lock-up expir on Jan 5 where earli investor will be elig to sell as much as 24.6 million shares. While I am accumul share under $70, we don't know what kind of sell we'll see by the big guy and gal in earli January. It could bring lower prices, or it may not as they decid to hold on for the growth stori and bigger gains.Mayb even a revisit of the old high abov $125 in 2017.

IDC expect demand for 40- and 100-gigabit switch to boom through 2020 and for Arista to grow along with that.It' all help Arista see it revenu jump 35% in the first nine month of 2016 to $801 million.

Juniper Networks Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know,12/7/2016,"2016 ha been a year of disappoint for investor inJunip Networks(NYSE: JNPR) . After begin the year with a stock price of $27 and change, Junip stock now look set to end the year right back where it began.And yet, if you ask the analyst at Credit Suisse, 2016' miser perform set up Junip stock to outperform in 2017. Thi morning, the invest banker announc it is upgrad Junip Network stock to outperform. What' more, after crunch the number on like revenu and profit margin growth, Credit Suiss say it' up it price target on the stock as well -- to $31 a share.makeArticleAd();Her are three thing you need to know about that.Credit Suiss think it' time to plug into Junip Network stock -- but is it right? Imag source: Getti Images.1. Sale are on the upswingQuot onStreetInsider.comthi morning, Credit Suiss argu that despit what it stock price might suggest to you, ""Junip is transit through the IT disrupt and volatil servic provid market successfully."" The compani boast ""a strong product portfolio,"" and ""increasingli diversifi product offerings"" that, say Credit Suisse, will enabl Junip to grow it revenu at about 3.7% to 3.8% over the next coupl of years.2. Profit are growing, tooGranted, though sub-4% sale growth might not sound impressive, it would at least be an improv over the perform Junip turn in thi year. Accord to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, the most Junip stock ha manag to produc so far thi year is sale growth of 1.9% over 2015 levels. Thus, a move to 3.8% sale growth, for example, would actual be twice as fast as Juniperhasbeen growing. And Credit Suiss believ these greater sale will ""drive oper leverage"" at Juniper, result in at least ""gradual EP growth.""Accord to the analyst, Junip is like to earn $2.29 per share in fiscal 2017, and then $2.40 per share in FY2018. Both those number would be a nice improv over the $1.59 in per-shar earn that Junip produc last year, and even compar to the $2.07 per share that analyst are forecast for 2017.3. What' drive the growth?Credit Suiss believ Junip is gain on rival such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) ,Hewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) , and Huawei in the battl for market share in ethernet switch -- but here' where the analyst' argument begin to fall apart. In Q2 2016, market researcherIDC notedthat Junip suffer a 4.3% declin in revenu at it switch business, despit 3% overal growth in the ethernet switch market worldwide. Thi indic a shrink market share, and accord toIDC data, thi trend continu into Q3.A worldwid switcher sale grew 2%, Juniper' sale declin 3.5% to just $222 million last quarter. And while that wa a better perform than Junip show in Q2, and show sequenti growth, it still indic continu market share slippag year over year.Granted, Junip rival Hewlett-Packard Enterpris and Cisco fare poorli last quarter as well, with switch revenu declin 4.3% and 5.4% respectively. But the market share gain that we'r see clearli aren't accru to Junip Networks, but rather to it rival Huawei -- whose revenu surg 91.6% year over year.Th most import thing: ValuationFind thi flaw in Credit Suisse' buy thesis, must we now reject Credit Suisse' argument entirely? Sadly, I believ the answer to thi question is ""yes.""With $602 million in trail net income, Junip stock sell for 16.7 time earn (net of cash and debt). That may not sound overli expensive, but most analyst who follow the stock agre that Junip is unlik to grow it profit at more than 11% annual over the next five years. Credit Suisse' forecast of $2.29 per share in profit next year, up 11% from thi year' project $2.07, doesn't hold out much promis of thi growth rate improv anytim soon.When you consider, further, that Credit Suisse' project is base on Junip Network enjoy gain in ethernet switch market share -- gain that IDC' data entir fail to confirm -- it follow that Juniper' busi isn't nearli as strong as Credit Suiss seem to think it is. To the contrary, of the top five player in thi particular segment of the internet equip market, Junip remain the weakest.I think Credit Suiss is wrong to recommend it.10 stock we like better than Junip NetworksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Risky Is FireEye Inc Stock?,12/7/2016,"Cybersecur firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) lost nearli 40% of it market valu thi year due to sluggish sale growth, cash burn concerns, and major execut departures. But now that FireEy trade at a 35% discount to it IPO price of $20, is the stock still too riski to touch? Let' examin it headwinds, tailwinds, cash flows, and valuat to find out.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th headwindsFireEye' revenu rose 13% annual to $186.4 million last quarter, repres it slowest year-over-year growth rate sinc it 2013 IPO. The compani expect to finish fiscal 2016 with 15%-16% sale growth and 4%-6% bill growth -- which is a big drop from it 46% sale growth and 35% bill growth in 2015.FireEy blame that slowdown on it ongo shift from on-sit secur applianc to subscription-bas servic like FireEy as a Servic (Faas). Competit also remain fierc --Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) bundl threat prevent solut with it network hardwar and software, andPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) andFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) have integr threat prevent featur into their next-gen firewalls.FireEy also lost sever key execut over the past two years. CFO Michael Sheridan resign last year, CEO David DeWalt step down thi June, and founder Ashar Aziz resign from the board of director in September.Th tailwindsFireEye' current CEO is Kevin Mandia, who join the compani after FireEy acquir hi compani Mandiant in 2014. Mandia is tri to boost FireEye' margin with hundr of layoff and widen it moat with Helix, an all-in-on platform that bundl togeth mani of FireEye' servic with a singl user interface. If it can success pivot away from applianc and toward FaaS, Helix, and it other subscription-bas services, FireEye' revenu growthmightacceler again.Mandia is not activ tri to sell FireEye, but the compani is still frequent cite as a takeov target for compani like Cisco. It Mandiant and iSight threat detect technolog are still consid ""best in breed"" solutions, and it serv over 5,000 custom across 67 countri -- includ nearli half the Forb Global 2000.The cash flowsUnd DeWalt, FireEy repeatedli struggl to gener posit cash flows. FireEy reli on secondari stock and convert debt offer to gener more cash, but those move dilut exist share and undermin investor confidence.FireEye' big stock-bas compens expenses, which gobbl up 32% of it revenu dure the first nine month of 2016, also prevent it from becom profit on a GAAP-adjust basis. Mandia' decis to reduc it workforc and implement other cost-cut measur is clearli aim at get those cost under control.Between the third quarter of 2015 and 2016, FireEye' gross margin rose from 73% to 74%, it oper margin improv from -32% to -14%, and it oper cash flow rose from neg $8.3 million to $14.1 million. Thank to those bottom line improvements, FireEy expect to gener posit free cash flow for all of 2017. That would mark the first time that FireEy haseverreport posit free cash flow sinc it IPO.Source:YChartsTh valuationsFireEye' enterpris value-to-sal ratio of 2.7 is lower than Palo Alto and Fortinet' respect EV/Sal ratio of 7.3 and 3.4, and it enterpris valu of $2 billion is a fairli afford target for bigger tech players. However, FireEye' EV/FCF ratio (an oft-us metric to measur high-growth companies) comparesverypoorli to Palo Alto, Fortinet, and mani other cybersecur player due to it neg free cash flow.Source:YChartsIf FireEye' FCF rise to posit territori next year, it valuat would look much safer for investor and potenti acquirers, and it stock could rebound. However, Mandia' plan to downsiz FireEy in the face of rise competit could also backfir if it sale and market team get outgun by team from larger rival like Cisco, Palo Alto, and Fortinet.So how riski is FireEye?FireEy ha certainli taken step in the right direction, but it' still averyriski stock. It plan to pivot from applianc to servic while downsiz sound reason on paper, but it could be tough to pull off amid unpredict enterpris spend and tough competition.Therefore, my overal impress of FireEy ha improved, but I think conserv investor would be better off stick with Cisco orSymantec, while investor who can stomach more volatil should take a closer look at the profit nich playerCyberArkinstead.10 stock we like better than FireEyeWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Slow sale growthPalo Alto post 34% year-over-year sale growth last quarter, but that repres it slowest growth rate sinc it 2012 IPO. Analyst expect the compani to post 31% sale growth thi year, compar to 49% growth last year. That slowdown ha been attribut to slower enterpris spending, competit in the perimet secur space, and a market shift from on-sit applianc to autom solut and subscription-bas softwar and services.3. The rise of bundl platformsTo stay competit in that market, Palo Alto launch it Next-Gener Secur Platform to bundl togeth nativ integr technologies, autom protect solutions, and threat intellig share solut on a scalabl platform for businesses.However, rival like Fortinet and FireEy are also expand with similar bundl plays. Fortinet offer an integr secur platform which bundl addit secur servic with it firewall, and FireEy recent unveil Helix, which bundl it threat prevent servic togeth under a singl user interface.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) also bundl next-gen firewal and other secur tool with it network hardwar and softwar -- make it tough for stand-alon player like Palo Alto and FireEy to stay competitive.4. Widen GAAP lossesPalo Alto' bottom line growth initi look solid -- it non-GAAP net incom rose 66% annual to $51.2 million last quarter. But on a GAAP basis, it net loss widen from $39.9 million to $61.8 million. That dispar wa mainli caus by it stock-bas compens (SBC) expenses, which rose 55% annual last quarter and gobbl up 29% of it revenues.High SBC expens are common in the competit Silicon Valley job market, but that put Palo Alto at a clear disadvantag against non-Silicon Valley rival like Isra firewal vendorCheck Point Software(NASDAQ: CHKP) -- which spent a mere 5% of it revenu on SBC expens last quarter. But if Palo Alto cut job and SBC expenses, as FireEy is current doing, it could eventu be outgun by it rivals' better-fund R&D and sale teams.5. Insid still hate the stockIf Palo Alto share were consid undervalued, we should see lot of insid buying. However, insid actual sold nearli 900,000 share over the past six month without buy a singl share on the open market. Mani major executives, includ CEO Mark McLaughlin, sold larg posit when the stock hit the $140 earlier thi year.Insid have plenti of reason to sell their shares, but those sale seemingli contradict the two-year $500 million buyback plan the compani announc in late August. But as I note in aprevi article, that buyback plan is like aim at offset the share dilut from it big stock bonus instead of tighten up it earn per share.Th key takeawayPalo Alto Network mightlooklik a great growth stock, but it sale growth is slow down and analysts' rosi project for 32% annual earn growth over the next five year are base on it non-GAAP earnings.Palo Alto is still a ""best in breed"" player in the crowd cybersecur market, but it stock could keep fall if it doesn't counter it competitor in the secur platform market and get it cost under control. Therefore, I'd suggest that investor interest in the cybersecur market take a closer look at conserv play like Cisco or profit nich player likeCyberArkinstead.10 stock we like better than Palo Alto NetworksWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cisco Systems Inc. Is Running out of Room to Grow...What's Next?,12/6/2016,"Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) is a ""mature"" tech stock which mani investor like own for incom instead of price appreciation. The network giant' revenu rose just 3% last year and is expect to declin about 2% thi year due to sluggish enterpris spend and the commodit of it core busi of router and switches.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Cisco.Therefore, investor might be wonder if Cisco can ever grow it busi to gener fresh sale growth again. The answer lie in three key market -- softwar defin networking, cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things.Softwar defin networkingSoftwar defin network (SDN) platform consist of cloud-bas network solut which depend more on softwar than hardware. As cloud-bas servic do the heavi lifting, the need for on-sit router and switch declin and hurt Cisco' core business. Last year, Guggenheim analyst Ryan Hutchinson warn that Cisco' outlook wa cloud by ""uncertainti around futur network architectur as more workload migrat to the cloud.""Cisco' major rival in thi space isArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) , which sell data center switch and router optim for SDN platforms. Arista believ that the combin of it Jericho switch and FlexRout softwar can replac on-sit router as cheaper SDN solutions. Cisco repeatedli su Arista over patent violat claims, but those lawsuit aren't slow Arista down -- the compani is still expect to post 34% sale growth thi year.Th real way to counter Arista is with better support for SDN platforms. Cisco' hardwar is alreadi compat with OpenFlow, the same open-sourc protocol use by Arista and OpFlex, a newer protocol it introduc in 2014. It' unclear if those effort will work, but Cisco clearli need to pivot it age network hardwar devic toward SDN-optim one to stay ahead of the tech curve.CybersecurityCisco' fastest grow busi is it cybersecur division, which protect it network hardwar and softwar from extern attacks. The unit wa built upon it acquisit of compani like ThreatGRID, Sourcefire, OpenDNS, and Lancope, and compet directli against perimet secur player like firewal vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) and threat prevent firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) .Bi bundl it cybersecur solut with it network hardwar and software, Cisco gain the advantag of price power and scale against these stand-alon competitors. As a result, Cisco' cybersecur busi ha becom it fastest grow divis -- sale rose 13% to $1.97 billion last year and account for 4% of it top line. Last quarter, the unit post 11% sale growth.Imag source: Getti Images.Dur last quarter' confer call , Cisco CEO Chuck Robbin note that the unit' ""integr architectur approach and best-in-bre portfolio"" wa well-receiv by customers, and note that it wa drive more recur subscription-bas revenue. It advanc threat secur revenu rose 100%, web secur solut revenu rose 60%, and total defer revenu -- a key indic of futur demand -- rose 39% annually.Look ahead, Cisco will like acquir addit secur compani to beef up that portfolio. It acquir cloud secur firm CloudLock and container compani ContainerX last quarter, andrumor suggestthat it could be interest in acquir FireEy or web applic secur companyImperva.Th Internet of ThingsCisco estim that the number of connect devic worldwid will doubl from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion in 2020. That so-cal Internet of Thing (IoT) market includ mobil devices, wearables, home autom appliances, connect cars, drones, and other gadgets.A one of the world' top network equip companies, Cisco view the IoT as a natur extens of it networks. That' whi the compani acquir IoT servic platform Jasper Technolog (now known as it IoT Cloud Busi Unit) for $1.4 billion earlier thi year. Cisco is bundl those IoT servic with it routers, switches, and UC (Unifi Comput Systems) servers, which help it counter competitor in each market.MicrosoftandIBMalreadi use Jasper' platform to link their cloud custom to IoT devices.Cisco is also invest heavili in the connect car market. Earlier thi year, itpartn withHyundaito develop in-vehicl network tech for high-spe data transfers. The compani believ that the platform can bridg the gap between today' connect car and driverless car in the near future. Cisco also provid end-to-end secur for vehicles, deliv remot diagnost and services, and let driver access third-parti cloud services.Th key takeawayTh SDN, cybersecurity, and IoT market all repres great long-term growth opportun for Cisco, but investor shouldn't expect the compani to post double-digit sale growth anytim soon. It core switch and router busi remain under pressur from cheaper rival likeHuawei, and it' struggl to counter nimbler rival like Arista.Thos challeng won't fade away anytim soon, but I believ that Cisco' forward dividend yield of 3.6%, low payout ratio of 47%, and it P/E of 14 (which is lower than the industri averag of 25) still make it a solid incom play at current prices.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology. And we think it stock price ha nearli unlimit room to run for earli in-the-know investors! To be one of them,just click here.Leo Sunown share of Cisco Systems.

Why Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Believers Need to Act Now,12/6/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTo sayTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR) sharehold have been jostl a bit thi year would be a signific understatement. The TWTR stock price start 2016 at $23, fell to a low of $14 by the middl of the year, soar to $25 by earli Octob on rumor that an acquisit wa coming, and sinc then have peel back to $18 when none of the suggest suitor actual pull the trigger.makeArticleAd();Source:Freestock via UnsplashA the old say goes, ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" Most owner of Twitter stock, have been burned, aren't apt to get their hope up again that a buyout is looming.Th irony? Now that most investor aren't expect it, they should probabl be expect it.TWTR Stock: Time Is EverythingWer the busi of buyout not like junior-high romances, it might be easier to digest the notion that Twitter is still a prime acquisit target. In other words, whispers, rumors, other potenti hookup and worri about what everyon els will say can often upset would-b eighth-grad relationships. Ditto for buyouts.And like middle-school love, suitor are kind of funni about get back togeth with an ""ex"" whenth go sour as quickli as they didbetween TWTR andWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), Twitter andSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) and even Twitter andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). TWTR stock wasn't readi to be acquir then, and with conclus drawn, it could be a while befor the compani is seen as buyable.5 Tech Stock That Should Top Your 2016 Christma Wish ListTh frustrat part: Twitter is still a veri ownabl company, particularli in the hand of an organ that ha dealt with consum before. In earli Octob though, that simpli wasn't the case.Plus, there wa the not-so-smal matter of a sky-high Twitter stock price that made ani deal too rich for most potenti buyer by the time ani of them could have made an offer.What a Differ Two Month MakesTo be clear, TWTR hasn't success complet a turnaround sinc earli October. A turnaround, however, ha becom much more plausibl dure that time.For one thing, the power of use Twitter as a mean of merg video and social network ha been valid in the meantime. TWTR had serv as the venu foronli a second NFL gamebi the point when the buyout rumor first surfaced, but there' no deni it wa still littl more than an experi at the time. If Walt Disney wa look for decis evid that it could reviv it struggl ESPN divis by meld it with the Twitter platform, it certainli didn't have it at the time.Now, however, that partnership with the NFL is turn heads. The remaind of the ten game Twitter had contract are airing, andth leagu is pleased. In the meantime, Twitter ha secur an actual sponsor for two NBA-rel livestream program that will air in the Philippines.It' not just the advent of sport and relat televis program that reposit TWTR stock in a fruit way, howev (although it sport partnership go mile to answer the question ""whi should I go to the Twitter page?"") The compani is clean up it platform, in multipl ways.Had it onli been cite by Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff as one of the key reason he couldn't justifi do a deal, it may have been dismissed. But, it wasn't just Benioff. Most observ agre that Twitter ha a bulli problem.It may not matter much right away, but in the middl of November, the compani final start to get seriou about deal with the hate rhetor that make the microblog platform a liability.Point being, much-need chang are underway.Bottom Line for Twitter StockIt' never a good idea to own a stock simpli becaus the compani is a rumor acquisit target. TWTR stock is no exception. But, when a much-need turnaround is underway for that company, decent odd of a buyout certainli don't hurt the bullish argument.And yes, there' final a light at the end of the tunnel for Twitter stock, on it own, or with a partner/buyer.Whi Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Will Pay Off in the Long-TermTWTR still ha a lot of problem to solve, to be clear. To that end, the fact that not one singl compani nibbl two month ago wa a wakeup call for Jack Dorsey - chang have to be made. In the meantime, they'v start to be made.Th catch: Anyon who think they can wait to profit step into Twitter stock on hope of a buyout right befor that news becom public knowledg is fool themselves. To avoid the veri price run up that turn a bunch of buyer off two month ago, ani deal is like go to be done befor ani non-insid ha ani clue an agreement ha been made.If you want to make a worthi trade on ani buyout potential, you have to own TWTR stock now, when there' no real certainti it' go to happen.But, you could do a lot worse.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Way to Make Money in the Market in 2017The 10 Biggest Stock Market Success of 2016The postWhi Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Believ Need to Act Nowappear first onInvestorPlace."

Although CSCO stock got Novemb start on a bullish foot, onc the compani unveil it fiscal Q1 number on Nov. 17, the sell ha been brisk. Cisco stock fell 5% that day, and sinc then, it ha continu to lose ground.makeArticleAd();Source:Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)It wasn't exactli the first quarter results, however, that did the bulk of the deed. It wa the company' lacklust Q2 outlook (and beyond) that wa the concern for owner of CSCO stock. In short, the maker of network hardwar is face a top-lin and bottom-lin headwind.Yet, as CiscoCEO Chuck Robbin commentedin the aftermath of the Q1 report, ""You have to look at it over time, and not just quarter to quarter.""He' got a valid point. The question is, what' Cisco go to look like in time, onc it complet it paradigm shift? Perhap more important, what might send CSCO lower should the transit not flow well?CSCO Chang Busi ModelCSCO is well establish as a network equip name. Indeed, the company' monik becam synonym with network in the late 90s, and although it ha been ding up a bit, Cisco stock ha held onto that crown ever since. Outright sale of hardwar wa it busi model.10 Way to Make Money in the Market in 2017A technolog ha chang though (and as competit caught up), CSCO is be forc to adapt. Hardwar mean less, and softwar mean more.Thi shift is readili evid in last quarter' revenu mix. Product revenu wa down 1%, while servic revenu grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. Switch revenu - the company' bread and butter - wa off 7%. Conversely, defer product revenu relat to recur and subscription-bas busi grew 48%.That' larg by design. As Robbin said of the prior quarter' numbers,""We'v continu to have veri good core execut in whatev the environ is, and also to shift to more of a softwar and subscript model. We had anoth quarter with defer grow nicely, it wa up 48%, at almost $4 billion. And we continu to see fantast growth in the secur busi … We are pleas with the continu transit to a softwar recur model. For example, the Cisco One busi wa a point-and-a-half of growth, and that move into a ratabl model last quarter, which would have previous been a one-tim sale. And then there' the strength in security, and our collabor and next-gen data center businesses.""On of the side effect of a recur revenu model is reliabl revenue, which in turn allow for a reliabl dividend.And, the companyhasstart to respect the appeal of payouts. The Cisco dividend ha grown from six cent per share per quarter in 2011 to 26 cent per share of CSCO stock now. That translat into a healthi dividend yield of 3.5%, which is on par with stock more commonli categor as ""value"" name …an idea your truli pose in the middl of November.Potenti Pitfal for CiscoWhil it' a necessari step in the right direct as virtual and softwar becom a better, cheaper altern to hardware, thi transit won't necessarili be an easi one.Th biggest stumbl block for Cisco stock is the simpl fact that the compani doesn't have as firm of a hold on the new market that it did on the old one.Brocad Commun Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:BRCD) is one of those name that ha posit itself well in the modern era of networking. It 5600 vRouter is the gold standard in software-bas routers.Meanwhile, though Robbin cheer the growth of the company' secur services, and that' an even more crowd field.Palo Alto Network Inc(NYSE:PANW),Fortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT) andFireEy Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) are just a hand of the compani alreadi in the secur business, and with a signific head start on CSCO.Can Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Spend It Way to Gains?Still, with $71 billion in the bank, it' tough to think Cisco can't buy it way out of ani problem it may find itself face in the forese future.Bottom Line for Cisco StockAlthough it' like to be a long, frustrat adjustment, it is an adjust CSCO stock is equip to handle. The question is, are owner of Cisco stock equip to handl the adjustment? It could take a long while for CSCO to becom the recur revenu machin it' aim to be.It may also requir someth of an adjust in the valuation-percept of Cisco stock.Th good news is that CSCO stock is present valu at a trail price-to-earn ratio of 14.1 and a forward-look price-to-earn ratio of 11.8. That' in line with the market' typic multipl for a valu stock. The bad news is, the market may not be readi to view Cisco stock in that way, punish it for slow growth … despit the grow stream of reliabl revenue.Still, for the true long-term and fan of income, CSCO could end up be a pleasant surprise.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace5 Tech Stock That Should Top Your 2016 Christma Wish ListTh 10 Biggest Stock Market Success of 2016The postWhi Cisco Systems, Inc.

12 Facts About the Internet of Things Every Investor Should Know,11/29/2016,"Imag source: Getti Images.Th Internet of Thing is one of those buzzword you hear everywhere, but nobodi ever bother to explain what it is. The concept is expect to fuel a stagger $3 trillion market by 2020, just four short year from now.makeArticleAd();So I'm here to help. You should know these 12 fact about the Internet of Thing right now:Th Internet of Thing (IoT) may seem new and unfamiliar, but it alreadi exist and you use it all the time.ATM start network in an IoT-lik way long befor the public internet wa a thing. In the 1970s, Carnegi Mellon Univers follow up with the world' firstsoda machineequip with remot inventori monitoring. These were import babi step in the direct of what we now think of as the Internet of Things.Curr exampl popular with consum includewear fit bands, smartwatches, smart TV sets,connect cars, and remot health monitors. Whenev your gadget are send data to a central process hub, you'r take part in the IoT.In the industri sector, you'll find IoT system at work in control manufactur equipment,manag energi use and production, andmonitor airplan engin performance. Sensor collect data, while remot system process the massiv inform flows. Compani use the result analysi to drive busi decisions, flag equip for maintenance, and much more.Th IoT sector is consolid quickly. In 2014,NXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) made a massiv bet on automot comput and the IoT with the $11.8 billion acquisit of rival Freescal Semiconductor. Less than a year later, NXP becam the target in an even larger IoT deal, as industri giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)launch a $47 billion bidfor the Netherlands-bas chipmaker.When use correctly, IoT system can open up new busi opportun and enhanc exist processes. Some of the magic lie in collect the right data, and the rest spring from run the number through intellig analysi tools.Th IoT requir strict secur polici and power shield from malici hack attempts. Thi wa alway obvious, but the need for even more protect is a lesson still be learn the hard way. In October, an autom network attack base on insecur IoT cameras, network routers, and digit video record brought down some of the biggest onlin household name for sever hours. IoT secur is a seriou sub-market of it own with the potenti to support mani billion-dollar specialists.Th IoT is actual not terribl well-known yet. Accord to a recent Harri Interactivepoll, onli 13% of consum in the U.K. would call themselv veri familiar with the IoT, and 48% were at least awar of the concept. That leav a lot of ground left to cover befor the IoT becom as recogniz as refriger and bicycles.However, nugget from the industri have made it into the mainstream, even though they aren't alway seen as exampl of the IoT. Harri found that 99% of it poll respond were awar of smart devices, which is pretti much the same thing under a differ name. Fit tracker fall in thi category.Proof that it' high time everyon learn what the concept is all about: There have been more IoT devic than peopl in the world sinc 2008, accord to global network report byCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) .Even so, the vast major of connect thing are still not properli integr into IoT. In a whitepap publish in 2011, Cisco said that onli 0.06% of all connect devic were networked, leav 99.94% of devic on the sidelines. Later Cisco report have lift the proport of IoT-act devic to roughli 0.5%, which still leav room for a 2,000-fold explos of smart, connect gadgets.Lucki break or inevit progress? You be the judge: The IoT explos dovetail neatli with the evolut of 4G and 5G wireless network standards, enabl far more connect devic than the old 2G and 3G platforms. Moreover, the IoT erupt would not be possibl withoutth IPv6 network address standard, which in theori provid enough address to connect everi atom on our planet. We have offici been out of address under the previou IPv4 standard sinc 2011, make do with workaround and recycl addresses.We'r alreadi on our way toward the Internet of Thing revolution, but there is a lot of growth and develop left to be done.

It is the one area, and I think we'v talk about before. It' the one area that peopl can put off do a refresh if there are ani macro concerns. That' what we typic see ani time you see ani econom paus or macro event.11%:On of the area where Cisco is invest the cost save from it restructur is security. The secur busi gener $540 million of revenu dure the first quarter -- up 11% year over year -- make it the fastest-grow segment for the company. Acquisit are drive some of thi growth, with Cisco aim tooffer integr solutionsthat stand out in a fragment secur industry.48%:Secur is one area of Cisco' busi that' shift toward softwar -- particularli subscript software. Thi shift is spread out revenu that would have previous been recogn upfront, hurt Cisco' headlin number in the short run. Kramer estim that thi transit reduc Cisco' revenu by as much as two percentag point dure the first quarter.Def revenue, which is revenu that ha not yet been recognized, is one way to measur the progress of Cisco' subscript businesses. Total defer revenu grew by 12% year over year in the first quarter to $17 billion, with the portion of product defer revenu relat to recur and subscript busi surg 48%.-3%:The data center segment, which includ Cisco' UC servers, suffer a 3% year-over-year revenu declin dure the first quarter. Data center wa grow at a double-digit pace not too long ago, make thi result particularli disappointing. Cisco point to a market shift from blade to rack server as well as gener macro-econom uncertainti as the main driver behind the decline.$3.1 billion:Despit a weak quarter in mani of Cisco' key segments, the compani remain wildli profitable. Non-GAAP net incom wa $3.1 billion, with a gross margin of 65.2% and an oper margin of 31.6%.-2% to -4%:One reason share of Cisco fell follow the company' earn report wa weak guidance. Exclud the divest set-top business, Cisco expect second-quart revenu to declin by between 2% and 4%. The compani isn't model ani improv in capit expenditur from it servic provid customers, although CEO Chuck Robbin is hope that some headwind will turn into tailwind onc President-elect Trump take office.$36.2 billion:Cisco is one of mani larg compani current hoard billion of dollar overseas, with $36.2 billion of net cash on it balanc sheet. As it stand today, profit from intern oper can't be brought into the U.S. without that cash be tax at 35%. With President-elect Trump promis to enact a repatri tax holiday,reduc that rate to 10%, Cisco' mountain of oversea cash could final be put to use. The compani is consid increas share buybacks, a higher dividend payment, debt reduction, acquisitions, and strateg invest as option if it' abl to repatri it oversea cash.$14.4 billion:Even without use it oversea cash, Cisco ha been abl to buy back a tremend number of shares, in part by take on debt. The compani spent $1 billion on share buyback dure the first quarter, and it' spent a total of $97.6 billion sinc it began it share buyback program. $14.4 billion remain author for further share buybacks, although thi number could rise if a repatri holiday becom a reality.Cisco' first-quart result may have beaten expectations, but it core switch busi is suffer from weak demand, and it data center busi ha stop grow altogether. The shift to subscript softwar and macro-econom uncertainti are team up to caus all sort of problem for the compani -- at least as far as the headlin number are concerned.

How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Should Shell Out Its Cash,11/28/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOf all the news to come out the victori of President-Elect Donald J. Trump, none will be greet more warmli than a possibl tax law chang forAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). That' becaus the much-vaunt cash hoard that most prais when speak about the tech giant might final be dump (at least in part) onAppl stockholders.Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrCorpor taxat rate in the U.S. remain at 35%, the highest in the world. As a result, mani corpor that have earn money oversea leav their profit overseas, as well. Thus, those profit do not get tax at U.S. rates.makeArticleAd();In the case of Appl stock, that cash hoard ha now reach $216 billion. Think about the sheer size of that cash pile, and what could be done with it - becaus right now, that cash pile is essenti worthless to AAPL.Well, mayb notworthless.Mayb not even close to that.But it doe hamstr Appl from be as effici with it capit deploy as it could.Appl Stock and the Wonder of CashI'v postul that if the tax code isn't changed, Appl would start make larg acquisit overseas. That way it could add to it top and bottom line, even if the profit would still resid overseas. It would have to make acquisit anyway, becaus Tim Cook is not demonstr that he ha ani vision for Appl - at least as a compani - and is just a game manager.7 Stock to Buy for the Santa Clau RallySo, let' assum there is a repatri of some kind, either through an exempt or perman chang in the tax code. First, let' look at where Appl stock would be present valued.Th prevail wisdom is that repatri cash will probabl be subject to a 10% to 15% tax rate, which mean up to $33 billion would be tax on AAPL, leav net proce of $183 billion. Add in the $21 billion of cash here in the U.S., and Appl stock ha a total of $204 billion, or about $40 per share in cash.At the current price of $111, Appl stock is thu trade at $71 per share. So the market say the busi itself is worth $376 billion. On trail 12-month net incom of $45.6 billion, Appl stock is thu trade at 8.3 time net income.Normally, we'd look at a company' earn growth rate and make a judgment if the stock is fairli valu base on whether it is trade at a reason multipl compar to it growth rate. There' a small problem with that, though.Apple' net incom fell in fiscal 2016 by about 16%. Analyst project the five-year EP to increas at 8% annually. However, that' earn per share, not net income. And EP growth is be juic becaus of stock buybacks, even if not by much.A long as Appl continu to be driven by iPhon sales, which account for some two-third of revenue, and Tim Cook doesn't show us what hi vision of the compani is go forward, I'm not inclin to offer AAPL stock the kind of premium it use to command.Still, at 8.3 time net income, Appl stock isn't expensive, either.I think the repatri of that money is what tip the scale to a buy for me.How Appl Should Spend That CashMost peopl think that Appl would increas it stock buyback. I'm not so sure about that. It wouldcontinueto buy back shares, but probabl do so at a reason pace, and certainli not all at once.Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Show Sign of HopeI think AAPL would be wise to prudent rais it dividend, as well. Right now, Appl stock onli yield 2.1%. Given how much cash it has, how much cash flow it generates, and that it would like to remain competit with bonds, Appl could increas the dividend into the 4% rang without break a sweat. That would onli requir an addit $10 billion per year, and Appl stock suddenli would have the (price) support of the incom crowd.Also, I think it' clear that Appl need to make some acquisit to build itself out. If that seem obvious, I agree. But remember: AAPL is not nearli as acquisition-happi as other in the tech space, such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO). It should purchas compani that are obvious synergist with it current form, and also branch into new area that are capabl of extend the Appl experience.Finally, I believ Appl should set up a $10 billion content studio. Yes,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and other are more entrenched. But the dividend of content in thi era will be paid for a long time to come.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter.

The studi is like to show that the cost increase, skill mismatch and suppli chain problem (the suppli chain is larg in Asia) would make thi cost prohibitive.Thi would rais iPhon price for consumers/squeez Apple' margins. But the studi will help Appl negoti with the government, which might agre to fund skill develop and/or subsid U.S.-mad phones.

Is Cisco Stock Worth Holding Through Its Transition?,11/21/2016,"Imag source: Cisco.Cisco System Inc.(NASDAQ: CSCO) is certainli face new hurdles, includ intensifi pressur from competitors, among which is the compani that often stoke fear in sharehold of rival companies:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) . However, after report mix fiscal 2017 first-quart earnings,Cisco stockstil look like it could be a strong contend for a spot in a long-term orient portfolio, even in the face of it challeng transition.Whi the stock is down nowCisco report fiscal 2017 Q1 earn for the period end Oct. 29 on Nov. 16, includ sale of $12.4 billion (exclud certain product categori that were sold in 2015), up 1% year over year. GAAP earn per share of $0.48 were 4% lower than a year ago, but in line with expectations.makeArticleAd();Whil the sale growth wa modest, the compani perform reason well in the quarter compar to expectations. What led to the 5% sell-off after earn were releas seem to be the weaker-than-expect guidanc for Q2. Becaus of weak order from servic providers, which Cisco manag blame on uncertainti in the economi and other macro-level trends, revenu (exclud the same segment as above) is expect to be 2% to 4% lower than a year ago, with EP (GAAP) expect to be in the rang of $0.42 to $0.47, which would be a 32% to 24% declin year over year.Cisco' transform in focusCisco Kelli Kramer said in the release:W execut well in Q1, deliv profit growth, and saw strong adopt of our subscription-bas and softwar offer as we transit our busi to a more recur revenu model. We will invest in key growth area and continu to focu on deliv sharehold value.Cisco seek to becom less reliant on hardware. Imag source: Cisco.Th transit Kramer is speak to is Cisco' attempt to break out of the hardwar and other tradit product categori such as Switch and Data Center, two segment that had declin sale in the quarter. Instead, Cisco believ other area of the busi will lead futur growth.Ther were highlight in Cisco' earnings, such as NGN routing, Cisco' second largest segment, which grew 6%; security, which increas 11%; and defer revenue, which account for subscript product and grew 12% year over year. Gross margin expand healthili dure the quarter, up 190 basi point to 64.7%, thank mostli to improv productivity.Profit margin still fell becaus of heavier costs, part of which is due to recent acquisitions. To help further it transformation, Cisco ha been busi buy up softwar and cloud-comput compani in the last quarter, including:CloudLock:Provid protect from the cloud to the network to the endpoint, enhanc Cisco' secur portfolio and ""Secur Everywhere"" strategy, and will help deliv more cloud-bas subscript services.ContainerX:Focus on develop enterprise-class contain manag technolog that work across a rang of platforms.Heroik Labs:Do busi under the name Worklife, provid softwar to improv meet productivity.I Cisco stock worth holding?There' one veri larg eleph in the room that Cisco sharehold (and those of ani business, really) need to watch out for: Amazon' next moves. Amazon Web Servic (AWS) ha made incred gain in the cloud-comput servic market in a veri short period. Bearish Cisco analyst believ Amazon can offer equal or better cloud servic for a lower cost, and that the hardwar use to build Amazon' infrastructur is brand-name, so there' littl chanc for Cisco to gain on the hardwar side.Still, Cisco' number are alreadi provid encourag that some of it newer growth segments, such as security, could becom bigger part of the compani and provid a way for Cisco to remain veri relev in a market focus on cloud comput and the Internet of Thing (IoT). These segment are still a rel small part of the company' total sales, but the transit focu doe seem to be pay off in those areas.Cisco also ha an incred larg cash stockpil that could soon be put to use in new product development, more acquisitions, and increas share buyback and dividends. Similar toApple, which ha made headlin for what it might do with it more than $200 billion, most of Cisco' massiv $71 billion in cash is outsid of the Unit State while the compani wait for more favor tax condit to repatri it into the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump ha signal for lower corpor tax rate and possibl a tax holiday to get these compani to bring their fund to the U.S., which we could see happen as earli as 2017.Cisco share are current trade at just 13 time estim 2017 earn estimates, and that also includ an attract 3.5% yield that Cisco manag ha signal is like to grow.

4 Things Cisco's Management Wants You to Know,11/18/2016,"Imag source: Cisco Systems.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) beat analyst estim when it report it fiscal first-quart result on Nov. 16, but there wa plenti of bad news for investor to consider. Collabor and data center, two growth segments, post revenu declines, and switching, Cisco' core business, report a decline, as well. Revenu dure the second quarter is expect to contract by 2% to 4%, adjust for divestitures, a disappoint outlook that sent share of the network hardwar giant tumbling.makeArticleAd();Th detail beyond the headlin number are important. Cisco' earn confer call wa pack with valuabl piec of data that can help investor fulli understand the company' results. Here are four key quot from manag that stood out, taken from the transcript provid byThomson Reuters.Secur continu to shineOn of Cisco' major growth initi is security, a busi that ha been grow at a double-digit rate in recent quarters. Becaus the secur busi is shift toward subscriptions, the 11% revenu growth Cisco report dure the first quarter doesn't fulli reflect how much progress the compani is making. CEO Chuck Robbin went into the details:Let me review a few area of our busi where our innov is drive momentum. First, security. Our secur revenu grew 11%, mark the fourth-consecut quarter of double-digit growth. We'r drive more subscription-bas recur business, result in defer revenu growth of 39%.That big jump in defer revenu suggest that Cisco' secur busi will continu grow at a rapid pace go forward. Robbin also point out that Cisco is the onli compani with secur product revenu exceed a $2 billion annual run rate and grow at a double-digit pace. Acquisit are drive some of thi growth, but Cisco' strategi of offer integr secur solut appear to be working.Explain the weak guidanceCisco' second-quart guidanc fell well short of expectations, with analyst expect the compani to grow sales. Robbin discuss the one major factor behind the weak guidance:I think if you just look at our guidance, let me be clear. It' predominantli the SP weak and the overal CapEx challeng that we'v seen in SP. That busi is larg account driven. You can assum that we have done an account by account by account analysi in that space and understand what' go on there. Right now I think there are a uniqu set of characteristics, particularli in the SP space. You have the overarch macro uncertainti in the economy, which I think ha led to the SP CapEx weak that' been report all year by the analysts, as well as you have polit and regulatori environ that are somewhat uncertain, both in the U.S. and around the world.Product order from servic provid slump 12% year over year, while everi other custom group post flat or posit order growth. Macro-econom uncertainty, someth we'v heard from Cisco before, is one component, as is the uncertainti creat by the U.S. election. Robbin wa optimist that President-elect Trump would enact business-friendli policies, potenti revers some of these headwinds. But the compani is not model ani improvement, thu the weak guidance.Th shift to subscriptionsSecur isn't the onli segment where a shift to subscript and recur revenu is hurt near-term results. When ask by an analyst about the exact impact of thi shift, CFO Kelli Kramer laid out the details:I'd say it' a coupl point for sure impact on our growth and it' a combin of -- it larg been histor collabor and secur and Meraki, but we are continu to add on our core platform with our Cisco ONE suite, like I mention last quarter, which that is now be recogn ratabl where a year ago, we would have recogn that as a perpetu licens sale. For example, just use Cisco ONE as an exampl in thi quarter, it would have been a point and a half just on that if we had recogn it perpetu like we had a year ago.Mov toward a recur revenu model should make revenu more predictable, but for now, it' hurt Cisco' top-lin numbers. Revenu that wa onc recogn all at onc is be spread out over time. In the near term, thi shift make Cisco' result look wors than they realli are. However, even adjust for the neg impact of the subscript shift, Cisco' guidanc still call for a sale decline.RepatriationWith President-elect Donald Trump promis to allow compani hold cash oversea to bring it back into the countri at a 10% tax rate, Cisco' mountain of oversea cash may final be put to good use. Kramer outlin the company' priorities:Just high level, as you could imagine, we have many, mani scenario of what we would do when repatri comes, which is a combin of obvious we would ring fenc in our debt and then we would have a blend of action we can certainli take with our dividend, as well as our share buyback, as well as lead flexibl for us to be abl to do M&A and strateg investments. It'd be a combin of all those things. Obviously, we listen veri close to our sharehold and how we want to do that and we recogn it will certainli give us a lot more flexibility.At the end of the first quarter, Cisco had about $71 billion of cash and invest on it balanc sheet, along with $34.8 billion of debt. Borrow cost are low for Cisco, with the compani pay just $198 million in interest dure the first quarter. But some debt reduct is likely.I suspect a major boost to the buyback would be in the card in the event of repatriation. Cisco may also rais it dividend more than it would have otherwise, or implement a special one-tim dividend. Thi is all specul at thi point, but I think it' safe to say that the compani would return some of that cash to shareholders.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In what seem like a repeat of event that occur just a few year ago, the cloud are block ani sunshin from reach stock in the sector. And those cloud have affect everyon form smaller panel player to industri stalwart likeFirst Solar, Inc.(NASDAQ:FSLR). For FSLR stock, the pain is hit deep.Source:U.S. Depart of the Interior via FlickrAft report abysm earnings, the solar panel and grid-scal project firm is go back to the draw board and restructur itself to surviv the near-term pain.makeArticleAd();Whil the crash in it share yesterday hurt (and it' continu to fall today), in the long run that restructur might bare some seriou fruit.A I said last time, FSLR stock is veri much a long-term play.Th Cloud Get Darker at First SolarNo one like wake up to a 13% declin after hours, onli to see an addit 11% declin when the bell final opens. Such wa the case yesterday when First Solar sharehold fired-up their brokerag account yesterday morning. Overnight, the solar firm manag to fuel some fear that all is not right with the sector. Today, share are still tumbl downward with a 4% drop in earli morn trading.7 Stock to Buy From the Scrap HeapOv the last year, solar stock likeSunPow Corporation(NASDAQ:SPWR) andTrina Solar Limit (ADR)(NYSE:TSL) have been trend down thank to an old foe. A sheer glut of panels.We'v been down thi road befor as the solar industri often fall victim to suppli gluts. Rather an abund of new panel hit the market, demand is realli the caus for the suppli glut. China' demand of new solar panel and project ha fallen by the wayside. That ha caus panel price to crater.For FSLR stock, the price drop in solar modul ha alreadi begun to hurt it bottom line. Dure it latest earn release, First Solar saw it revenu declin by 45% and it wa forc to walk away from some money losing, util scale solar projects. That' a big deal as those grid-scal project are realli it bread-n-butter. FSLR wa also forc to cut it guidanc for the rest of 2016 and 2017.But apparently, it wasn't enough.Thank to the continu glut of panel and recent unfavor oper environ - *cough* Trump' presidenti win - First Solar ha taken the chainsaw to it busi and ha announc a massiv restructur effort to ""kick the can"" until the sun shine again.Loss at FSLR for a Whole YearFirst Solar ha been a superstar in term of panel efficiency. As a result, it modul captur more sun and are better at turn that sunshin into electricity. The problem is they are more expens to buy. With price so darn low for regular panels, it doesn't make much sens for solar project develop to use FSLR' better panels. As a result, First Solar announc plan to produc cheaper panel that aren't as good.But the firm ha hit a road block. The glut ha gotten wors and one of the cheaper design is now too expensive.FLSR ha now abandon plan for the Seri 5 product and will bring it product of it Seri 6 modul to the market earlier. However, that is still a full year away. In the meantime, it Seri 4 modul will continu product and slowli phase out until the newer cheaper panel are on the market.What doe it realli mean? Somebig time charg and loss for the firm. FSLR now expect a loss per share of $2 to $4 thi year. Just a few week ago, it had guid to profit of $3.75 to $3.90 per share. Those loss come from cut 1,200 job and realiz pretax restructur charg of $500 million to $700 million dure the fourth quarter.Mor importantly, the mid-term outlook isn't good either as First Solar now estim that it will see lower revenu and panel shipment dure all of 2017. It didn't give ani profit estim for the new year.Keep in mind, FSLR alreadi lower it outlook when it report earn last time.Look Longer-Term for FSLR StockTh continu panel price declin and major charg at First Solar are certainli troubling. Not onli for FSLR stock, but the entir industry. And for some pure-panel players, it could be their death knell. But for First Solar, thi could be a real opportun for investors.It' Time to Rethink How We Valu Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) StockTh key to rememb is that First Solar' main focu is those grid-scal projects. The bulk of FSLR' custom base is still util and major power provid - not mom 'n' pop rooftop firm likeSolarC Corp(NASDAQ:SCTY). A major util ha a differ set of mandates. And thank to regul and tax advantages, when they commit to a project, it usual get done. That' where FSLR stock will shine long-term.Th roll-out of it newer cheaper panel will onli help push more power produc into First Solar' hands. The charg hurt today - veri much so - but they also show that FSLR is will it do what it take to keep it competit advantage.Th Bottom Line: If you have a longer-term timeline, the drop in First Solar share might be a great time to snag some and put them away for a while. Solar ha alway been a long-term game and the recent move by FSLR are insur that it it'll be around to play that game in the next decade.A of thi writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 10 Best Pharma Stock Under Presid Trump7 Blue-Chip Stock That Are Due for a ReckoningTh postFirst Solar, Inc.

It integr it onlin store with in-stor pick-up last Christmas, grow onlin sale by 30%, and wa plan $2.5 billion of invest in technolog by 2017.7 Stock to Buy From the Scrap HeapAnalyst were initi skeptic of it' move, and earli result were poor, but last Christma made analyst believ of Target stock and the compani is now consid an e-commerc leader.Cornell' latest move is even bigger. He' go to make TGT the Citi Mous to Walmart' Countri Mouse.Target plan to open hundr of small-format stores, mostli in larg cities, reshap the company' imag and real estat footprint in the process.WMT CEO Doug McMillon had tri someth similar start in 2014, open Neighborhood Market and plan Walmart Express store built around ga stations, but Walmart abandon the plan thi year, close 269 outlets.Th differ between the two plan lie in where the small store are, and who they are aim at.Whil the Walmart Neighborhood Market were in suburbs, and repres in-fil between larger Walmart SuperCenters, the new TGT store arein the center of cities, and in colleg towns, highlight by a 45,000 square-foot unit in Tribeca, in lower Manhattan.Whil the Neighborhood Market were also smaller, cookie-cutt version of WMT' larger outlets, heavi on the groceri and mostli self-service, the new Target store are custom to their neighborhood and the compani is invest heavili in it suppli chain to get the specif good each locat needs.Bottom Line on Target StockIt' the plan adapt to local tast - and the back-end suppli chain need to fulfil those need - that is go to determin whether thi plan succeeds.In set hi sight on urban life, Cornel is go after a growth market and take advantag of TGT' smaller size, rel to Walmart. The question is whether the chain' discount imag can handl the shift, and whether it can deliv price that are below those of other retail in urban cores.It' Time to Rethink How We Valu Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) StockIf Cornel can make thi work then Target stock becom a real threat to store likeWhol Food Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) on the groceri side andMacy' Inc(NYSE:M) on the retail end. These high-end merchant have focus on urban market to maintain margins, and TGT is threaten to cut them.Anoth question is whether urban consum will flock to a store call Target. Cornel think they will, becaus mani urban newcom are famili with small children, not the singl and young marri who move intown in previou decades.Such consum may be look for bargains. If they are, and if Target can integr it e-commerc effort neatli into such stores, the company' stock could be in for big gains.If you'r will to take a bigger risk for a possibl great reward, look to Target. If you'r mainli look for yield and rel safety, you'r a WMT shopper.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT),11/17/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTarget Corporation(TGT) is the 3rd largest discount retail in the Unit State base on it $40 billion market cap. OnlyCostco Wholesal Corporation(COST) andWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(WMT) are larger.Target ha increas it dividend payment for anamaz 45 consecut years. The company' long dividend streak show that Target' busi is strong and stabl enough to reward sharehold over a wide varieti of econom conditions.makeArticleAd();Target' dividend streak put it in rarefi air. Target is one of only50 Dividend Aristocrats. Dividend Aristocrat are S&P 500stock with 25+ year of consecut dividend increases. Target just pass it ex-dividend date on Novemb 14, and will pay out 60 cent per share on Decemb 10th.TGT stock current ha a high 3.5% dividend yield and a low price-to-earn ratio of 13.4. With that in mind is now the time to buy Target?Thi articl examin the invest prospect of Target.Histor Growth & Futur Growth ProspectsTarget ha manag to grow it dividend payment at a compound rate of 19% a year over the last decade. Earnings-per-shar have grown at a more pedestrian 5.6% a year over the same period.At thi point it' import to note that earnings-per-shar growth (rel to dividend growth) is a better measur of underli intrins valu per share growthfor Target. That' becaus Target' dividend growth is a function of significantli increas it payout ratio.A decad ago, Target' payout ratio wa around 15%. Today, the company' payout ratio is 42%. It' imposs for TGT to tripl it payout ratio again over the next decade. Therefore, Target' dividend growth is go to slow. I expect dividend to grow about in line with earnings-per-shar go forward.Target' earnings-per-shar growth of 5.6% a year over the last decad isn't great. I'd put it in the 'mediocr growth' category. But here' the thing…TGT grew despit massiv manageri missteps.Ov the last decade, TGT dealt with a botch expans into Canada, a highli public data breach, and the Great Recession. Despit all this, the compani still manag to grow it earnings-per-shar at 5.6% a year.Th Best Invest for 2017Even if Target grow at 'just' ~5.5% a year over the next decade, investor will see solid total return when you factor in the company' dividend yield. TGT' 3.5% dividend yield combin with minimum 5.5% expect earnings-per-shar growth give investor expect total return of 9.0% a yearbefor valuat multipl changes…TGT Stock ValuationTher are two factor that - more than ani other - determin the probabl of success of an investment:Ar you invest in a high qualiti business?Ar you invest in a busi that is either fairli valu or undervalued?Look at Target' long-term dividend streak give us a big hint as to whether Target is a qualiti business.Th compani ha a strong and durabl competit advantag that ha allow it to increas it dividend payment for 45 consecut years.Specifically, TGT benefit from it larg size. In the discount retail industry, size matters. Larg busi benefit from economi of scale. They pass these discount onto customers. Low price attract more customers, make the compani even larger, in a virtuou cycle.On top of that, Target also ha store that are gener perceiv as cleaner and a bit more 'upscale' than rival Wal-Mart. The company' brand and reput for fashion merchandis enhanc the company' competit advantage.There' littl doubt Target is a high qualiti busi with a sharehold friendli management… But is the compani trade for fair value?TGT current ha a price-to-earn ratio of just 13.4. The company' histor averag price-to-earn ratio over the last decad is around 15.5. Base on it own histor averag price-to-earn ratio, Target look undervalu at current prices.Th compani also look (deeply) undervalu rel to the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is current trade for a price-to-earn ratio of24.9. Now ask yourself, is Target significantli wors than the 'average' S&P 500 stock?I don't think so… And yet, the compani trade for a price-to-earn ratio that is nearlyhalfthat of the S&P 500.Final Thought On Target' Invest ProspectsTarget ha a long histori of reward sharehold with rise dividends. The compani went ex-dividend on Novemb 14th - mark yet anoth dividend payment come to shareholders. In addit to it high dividend yield, Target also regularli repurchas it shares. The compani ha reduc it share count by around 15% over the last 5 years.Target' manag is object sharehold friendli judg by it dividend and share repurchases. The compani ha solid-if-not-spectacular expect growth as well.Even if Target manag to grow it earnings-per-shar at just 5.5% a year, investor can still expect total return of 9% a year at current prices, thank to Target' dividend yield.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Screech to a HaltBut… Actual invest return are like to be higher.

If you want a MacBook Pro that' faster or ha more storag capac in a year or two, you have no choic but to buy a new one.React and Impact on AAPLA might be expected, the onlin reaction to Apple' move ha been univers negative.

Then it focus on the Zack Rank #1s, #2 and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buy and Holds, respectively. But then it select the outperform stock with the smallest percentag price chang over the last 4 weeks.Whi would I do someth like that?Here' why.You'v probabl heard the old adag that roughli half of a stock' price movement can be attribut to the group that it' in. And that' true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocr stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for thi veri reason.Now, take a look at ani top group. You'll see plenti of fantast stock with some impress price gain in there. But not everi stock in everi group move in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than other at ani given time.So by focus on the stock with the smallest percentag price chang with fundament that are just as good as those make the biggest price change, you might find yourself get into the stock readi to make the biggest potenti catch-up move.Here' how to set up that screen:•Best Zack Rank Sector -- Best 8We'r screen for onli those stock with the best (lowest) averag Zack Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sector give us the best 50% of sectors.•Best Zack Rank Industri -- Best 132makeArticleAd();Next step is to get onli the best Zack Rank Industri come thru. Sinc there are 264 'X' or expand industri we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that onli the industri that also happen to be in the top sector will get thru. If an industri is rank as one of the best but it' outsid of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.•Zack Rank less than or equal to 2Now the screen get narrow down even more by look at onli the Zack Rank #1s, #2s. Onli Strong Buy and Buy can get through.•Pric and Avg. Volum greater than or equal to $5 and 100,000 sharesOnli stock over $5 with at least an averag of 100,0000 share trade daili will be considered.•Rel % Price Chang -- 4 Week greater than 0Thi mean we'r screen for onli those stock that have outperform the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.•% Chang in Price -- 4 Weeks: Bottom 50Then final we'r scan for the bottom 50 stock with the lowest percentag price chang over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stock have outperform the market, they increas in price less than their peers.So each one of these stock is in a top Sector and top Industri within that Sector. Thi alon will tip the odd of success in your favor by a great deal when you consid that the best Zack Rank group outperform the worst one by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by select those stock with the best Zack Rank along with the best price perform over the last 4 weeks, you now have onli a list of winner from which to choos from.And from that list of winners, we'r select the one that have gain less than their peer on that list. Remember, these stock aren't 'dogs' or unrespons stocks. Quit the contrary; they have all outperform the market. It just so happen that they increas less than the other on the list. But becaus they are a top rate stock in a top rate industry, we'v singl these out as the one that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It' an interest screen that ha gener a lot of great names.Her are 5 from that list:(NASDAQ:CSCO-Fre Report) Cisco Systems(NASDAQ:CSII-Fre Report) Cardiovascular Systems(NASDAQ:FIVN-Fre Report) Five9, Inc.(NYSE:GNRC-Fre Report) Generac Holdings(NASDAQ:NXTM-Fre Report) Nxstage MedicalAl great look stock that seem to have lot more upsid in store for them.Get the rest of the stock on the list and start put thi and other idea to the test.

Instead of react to the threat of a low-cost disruptor, they ignor it, and eventu go under.Cisco isn't buri it head in the sand and shi away from disruption. Last year, former CEO John Chamber warn that compani mustdisrupt themselvesor face disruption.Cisco ha creat ""spin-ins"" to deal with the threat of softwar defin networking.

Top Stocks with Big Potential Catch-Up Moves,11/15/2016,"Given the recent run-up in the market last week, here' a screen I'v been use recent for my own stock picking.First, it focus on the top Zack Rank Sector and Industries. Then it focus on the Zack Rank #1s, #2 and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buy and Holds, respectively. But then it select the outperform stock with the smallest percentag price chang over the last 4 weeks.Whi would I do someth like that?Here' why.You'v probabl heard the old adag that roughli half of a stock' price movement can be attribut to the group that it' in. And that' true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocr stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for thi veri reason.Now, take a look at ani top group. You'll see plenti of fantast stock with some impress price gain in there. But not everi stock in everi group move in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than other at ani given time.So by focus on the stock with the smallest percentag price chang with fundament that are just as good as those make the biggest price change, you might find yourself get into the stock readi to make the biggest potenti catch-up move.Here' how to set up that screen:•Best Zack Rank Sector -- Best 8We'r screen for onli those stock with the best (lowest) averag Zack Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sector give us the best 50% of sectors.•Best Zack Rank Industri -- Best 132makeArticleAd();Next step is to get onli the best Zack Rank Industri come thru. Sinc there are 264 'X' or expand industri we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that onli the industri that also happen to be in the top sector will get thru. If an industri is rank as one of the best but it' outsid of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.•Zack Rank less than or equal to 2Now the screen get narrow down even more by look at onli the Zack Rank #1s, #2s. Onli Strong Buy and Buy can get through.•Pric and Avg. Volum greater than or equal to $5 and 100,000 sharesOnli stock over $5 with at least an averag of 100,0000 share trade daili will be considered.•Rel % Price Chang -- 4 Week greater than 0Thi mean we'r screen for onli those stock that have outperform the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.•% Chang in Price -- 4 Weeks: Bottom 50Then final we'r scan for the bottom 50 stock with the lowest percentag price chang over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stock have outperform the market, they increas in price less than their peers.So each one of these stock is in a top Sector and top Industri within that Sector. Thi alon will tip the odd of success in your favor by a great deal when you consid that the best Zack Rank group outperform the worst one by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by select those stock with the best Zack Rank along with the best price perform over the last 4 weeks, you now have onli a list of winner from which to choos from.And from that list of winners, we'r select the one that have gain less than their peer on that list. Remember, these stock aren't 'dogs' or unrespons stocks. Quit the contrary; they have all outperform the market. It just so happen that they increas less than the other on the list. But becaus they are a top rate stock in a top rate industry, we'v singl these out as the one that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It' an interest screen that ha gener a lot of great names.Her are 5 from that list:CSCOCisco SystemsCSIICardiovascular SystemsFIVNFive9, Inc.GNRCGenerac HoldingsNXTMNxstag MedicalAl great look stock that seem to have lot more upsid in store for them.Get the rest of the stock on the list and start put thi and other idea to the test.

ESPN' import to DIS' oper profit is so critic that investor have a hard time focus on anyth else.makeArticleAd();That might have them miss Disney' wider strategi here.Old-lin technolog compani are go through pain transit of their own. Place likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Cisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andOracl Corporation(NASDAQ:ORCL) are shrink their tradit way of distribut their good and servic in favor of the Cloud. Cloud-bas servic aren't grow fast enough to offset loss in the legaci busi - but they will eventually.That' kind of what DI is do with ESPN. Sure, consum are cut cords, but that just mean Disney ha to reach them through new mean of distribution, like internet TV and relat tech.That' whi Iger is abl to remain sanguin in the face of such hefti subscrib losses. He ha a plan to make up for them, but it' go to take time. As he said on a confer call with analyst after quarterli results:""[N]ew entrant in the marketplace, particularli [internet TV services], are go to offer ESPN opportun that they haven't had befor to reach more people. And in particular, we think those offerings, becaus of their pricing, user interfac [and] mobile-friendli nature, are like to caus more Millenni to either stay in the multichannel ecosystem as subscrib or to enter it when they might not have in the past.""DI Goe Over the TopIt' a credibl strategi but it doesn't chang the fact that DI stock look pretti pricey for a compani in transit with a busi as import as ESPN.From analyst at Barclays:""With newer Over The Top bundl emerging, ESPN should be abl to moder some of the impact of legaci [pay-TV] declines. To be clear, we continu to believ ESPN is secularli challenged, and it affili growth of around 3%, second-slowest after Viacom (VIAB) , underlin thi fact. However, with more visibl at least over the next year, we believ the drag from thi factor on the stock is like to moderate.""That can't happen fast enough for ESPN given it rate of decline, but long-term bull need to accept that thi is go to be a slog.

"3 Reasons Why Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Is Worth Its Insane Valuation",11/15/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhi would anyon pay 300 time earn for a stock, let aloneNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), a compani that made just$52 millionin the third quarter from $2.2 billion in revenue?Source:Via NetflixEven better, whi would someon buy Netflix stock when in Q3 2016 it use $462 million more in cash then came in the door from subscribers?makeArticleAd();For valu investors, the answer' an easi one. They wouldn't.But for those who can see past the financials, I see three big reason to remain interest in Netflix stock. Not the least of which is the fact the Netflix stock price ha bare budg over the past 52 weeks, up just 1.7% through Nov. 11. Indeed, NFLX is due for a move higher.That said, it' not easi for me to write about the upsid potenti of Netflix.5 Tech Stock in Troubl After TrumpIn September, I made the case whyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) wasa much better stock to buythan Netflix. Despit Jeff Bezo and Co.missingQ3 2016 earn and revenu estimates, Amazon Web Servic continu to grow by 50% or more each year, make it a veri import piec of the Amazon pie.But really, I just love how Amazon isn't afraid to invest heap of money in area it feel have the greatest growth potential, regardless of the short-term hit to earnings. It' truli amazing.But there' someth to be said of Netflix for ad 3.6 million member in the third quarter, 57% higher than it forecast for the three-month period end Sept. 30.Netflix Still GrowingNetflix, Inc.' subscrib growth repres a 4.3% increas in it global members, from 83.2 million at the end of Q2. As a result of it unexpectedli high sign-up rate, Netflix increas revenu in the third quarter by 36% year-over-year to $2.16 billion, the first time it' gone over $2 billion in global stream in a quarter.Forget earnings. That' a signific accomplishment, especi on a constant currenc basi where global stream revenu in Q3 were up 39%, or 400 basi point higher year-over-year.Pick up three million member outsid the U.S. each quarter, Netflix should see it intern membership overtak it U.S. membership sometim in Q2 or Q3 2017. And that' without China come on board anytim soon.Netflix ha truli becom a global busi and the first global TV network.Hous of Card Meet the Hous of MouseA coupl of day afterInvestorPlacecontributor Jame Brumley wrote about whi he thinkit make senseforWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) to buy Netflix, fellow contributor Lawrenc Meyer chime in about the reason whyit doesn't make sense.Both argument are good ones.Brumley feel that Disney ha to do someth to pump up the tire of a letharg ESPN subscrib count, while Meyer believ pay $45 billion or more to acquir an over-the-top televis servic that bare make money is hardli a smart alloc of Disney' capital.Who' right? I believ Brumley is.Sure, buy Netflix would be Disney' largest acquisit ever - it acquiredCapit Cities/ABCin 1995 for$19 billion- and not an easi one to pull off, but the altern is to pass on the video stream compani and sit idli by while a competitor of some descript gobbl it up.I just don't think Bob Iger, Disney' CEO, who is look to retir at some point in the not-to-dist future, will want to go out on a sour note.It might be a lot of money to pay, but it send a signal to investor that Disney is seriou about the digit world. And hope it' enough to keep ESPN relev for year to come.Re HastingsA I said previously, Bob Iger is look for the ideal person to replac himself at the head of the Disney table. Reed Hast would be a logic candidate. He' built a huge busi from scratch, understand the entertain busi and the idea of convergence, and he know how Disney oper consid Netflix' exist pay-TVdealwith the company.It' not easi to find good CEOs; Hastings, despit hi company' inabl to gener free cash flow, is one of the best in the business. He might not be an intern candidate, but if DI want someon who can hit the ground running, I think he'd be at the top of the list.Bottom Line on Netflix StockNetflix stock' forward P/E is about half it trail ratio, so we'r not quit in the noseble valuat zone, but we'r close. I believ that the valu of a compani to a larg extent is what potenti buyer are will to pay.You might not think a basebal player is worth $30 million a season, but if a team' will to pay that price, then the valuation, at least in their opinion, is more than fair.2 Post-Trump Trade for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) EarningsAt the end of the day, that' all that realli matters.I might not pay 150 or 300 time earn for Netflix stock, but eventually, somebodi will, whether it' Disney or anoth multi-billion corporation.Netflix will be acquired.

"As Cybercrime Rises, So Does Spending On Cyber Security",11/14/2016,"The world is becom increasingli connect through network and data in an ecosystem govern by digit technolog which have creat immens opportun for individuals, busi and organizations. The assimil of mobile, IoT devices, cloud computing, and other high-tech solut have chang the way people, businesses, organ and govern connect and work.Whil the interconnect of devic and use of sophist technolog is posit chang the world, it is increasingli be challeng by cybercrime, clearli reflect by the steep rise in the number of cyber-rel fraud and crime report in the recent years.Cisco point out that, “Cybercrimin have refin their back-end infrastructur to carri out attack in way that increas effici and profits” and thu everi industry, from financi servic to entertainment, is vulner to such risks. In 2015, cybercrim rank as thesecond mostreport econom crime. Increasingli frequent and precision-bas cyber-attack call for a stronger fortif against them.makeArticleAd();Cyb attack can be categor across variou degrees. While some involv data breach which expos sensit inform like trade secrets, person data, intellectu property, and other confidenti information, other threat involv disabl softwar infrastructure, take over systems, or denial of service.Th total number of cyber secur incid report in 2009 were 3.4 million while the number increas to 59.1 million in 2015, as per a PwC globalsurvey. “The U.S. Feder Reserv detect more than 50 cyber breach between 2011 and 2015, with sever incid describ intern as ""espionage,"" accord to Fed records” asreportedbi Reuters. A recent releasedreportbi MetricStream reveal that 66.2% of financi organ face at least one cybersecur attack in the last year.Popular retail hous such as Target and Home Depot have been victim of such activ result in loss of costum data and credit card information. Not just companies, even individu are prone to risk with an estim an “estim 556 million peopl fall victim to cybercrim annually” which translat to 12 peopl everi second. These figur perhap don’t reflect the exact situat as mani cybercrim incid either go unreport or undetect for a long time.Cyb attack don't just result in loss of money or data, they also dent the reput of the entiti affect by the attack, culmin in the loss of trust among supplier and customers. Attack can also trigger regulatori or legal proceedings, neglig claims, and can lead to the loss of product and competitiveness, especi in case of industri espionag which often go undetected. It ispredictedthat globally, cybercrim cost will touch $6 trillion annual by 2021, from $3 trillion in 2015.The race among the cyber crimin and cyber secur provid is a tough and a challeng one. It is unbeliev how a comput node in part of the world can actual play mischief with bank account or get control of a company’ sensit data, which may be in anoth part of the world.Given the grow incid and sophist of cyber-attacks, corpor and govern have increas alloc toward combat cybercrime. In fact, mani have even resort to insur coverag for cyber liability. It isestimatedthat the cyber insur market could grow to $5 billion by 2018 in annual premium and to at least $7.5 billion by 2020.The global spend on cybersecur product and servic for defend against cybercrim is project to exceed $1 trillion cumul over the next five years, from 2017 to 2021 as per theestimatesof Cybersecur Ventures.In the U.S., Presid Obama laid great emphasi on cybersecur as he identifi it “a the most seriou econom and nation secur challenge.” Accord to the Cybersecur Nation Action Plan (CNAP), the U.S. administrationannouncedan invest of over $19 billion for cybersecur as part of the President’ Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Budget, repres a more than 35% increas from FY 2016 in overal Feder resourc for cybersecurity.Microsoftestimatesthat by 2020, 4 billion peopl will be online, 50 billion devic will be connect and data volum will be 50 time great than it is today. It is also estim that about 75% of infrastructur will be control by third parti cloud or internet servic providers. Thus, “A we look to the future, the explos of connect devic and data flow are make it even more challeng to protect against advanc target attacks.”Whil thi is a challeng situation, there lie great opportun for compani oper in the field of cyber security, as they wit an increas demand for product which empow compani and institut to fight the menac of cybercrime.Intern Busi Machin Corpor (IBM), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), root9B Technolog Limit (RTNB), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), Check Point Softwar Technolog Limit (CHKP), FireEye, Inc. (FEYE), Gigamon, Inc.

The increas compet within the space and the challeng thrown by hacker and cybercrimin are compel these compani to stay ahead of the dark shadow look to cast their spell."

A Weak Quarter Expected for Cisco Systems,11/13/2016,"Network hardwar giantCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) ha made a habit of beat analyst estimates, and the compani will tri to extend that streak when it report it fiscal first-quart result after the market close on Nov. 16. Cisco perform better than expect dure the fourth quarter, but the announc of signific layoff balanc out that good news. Revenu ha declin for three quarter in a row, and Cisco' guidanc suggest that a fourth quarter of declin is likely.Imag source: Cisco Systems.makeArticleAd();What analyst are expectingCisco guid for year-over-year revenu growth between -1% and 1%, exclud divestitures, dure the first quarter. The averag analyst estimate, which doesn't exclud that neg impact, call for revenu of $12.34 billion, a 2.7% drop. Analyst do expect Cisco to return to revenu growth dure the second quarter, but it look like that anoth revenu declin is in the cards.Turn to earnings, analyst expect Cisco to produc non-GAAP EP of $0.59, right in the middl of the company' guidanc range. Thi repres flat earn compar to the prior-year period. Dure the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EP surg 9%, driven by a higher gross margin and lower oper expenses. That kind of growth is unlik to be repeat dure the first quarter.A restructur plan amid tepid growthCisco still deriv the bulk of it revenu from network switch and routers, two busi that are no longer produc much growth. Collaboration, data center, and secur are three growth area Cisco ha focus on in recent years, and the company' restructur effort could help acceler growth in those businesses.Cisco plan to elimin 5,500 posit begin in the first quarter -- roughli 7% of it global workforce. These layoff are occur in low-growth areas, with the compani expect to reinvest the cost save in busi that have the potenti to return the compani to growth. It' unlik that there will be an immedi impact, but investor should expect to hear more about thi plan from manag dure Cisco' earn confer call.Oversea cashCisco is one of mani larg technolog compani that have mountain of cash sit overseas. At the moment, bring that cash back to the U.S. would trigger repatri tax of 35%. Follow the elect of Donald Trump, who promis to allow U.S. compani to bring back oversea cash andpay a 10% tax rate, the issu of Cisco' cash is like to come up dure the company' confer call.Cisco ha taken on debt in order to fund dividend and share buybacks, while it hoard of cash continu to grow. If a lower repatri tax is implemented, it would allow Cisco to bring back that excess cash, potenti fuel a higher dividend payment, more share buybacks, or a greater number of acquisitions. Investor should be on the lookout for ani guidanc on that front.Growth businessesDur fiscal 2016, collabor and secur were standout for Cisco in term of growth. The collabor segment, which includ everyth from video conferenc equip to the company' Spark commun software, ha grown into the third-largest segment. Secur is much smaller, but it grew at a double-digit pace in fiscal 2016, and a slew of recent acquisit should help drive continu growth.On thing hold Cisco' revenu and earn back is the company' shift toward subscription-bas softwar and services. Both the collabor and secur busi heavili tilt toward software, creat a situat where an increas amount of revenu is realiz over time instead of up front. Dure the fourth quarter, Cisco' defer revenu from softwar and subscript grew by 33%. That growth is a good indic that Cisco' strategi is working, despit the sluggish headlin numbers.On an absolut basis, Cisco' first quarter is like to be lackluster. A revenu declin and flat earn are noth to get excit about. The company' guidanc will be important, as will commentari from manag regard it oversea cash, the effect of it restructuring, and how it expect the result of the elect to affect it intern business. With Cisco deriv a signific portion of it revenu from intern markets, ani backlash against American compani would be bad news for the tech giant.10 stock we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But given that the GOP will have control of both hous of Congress, there should be littl doubt that we will see some major changes.Source:Gag Skidmor via Wikimedia (Modified)For example, there could be more friction and difficulti with trade. Let' face it, compani likeAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) have global ecosystem for logist and manufacturing.makeArticleAd();Oh, and then there is the issu of antitrust. Alreadi Donald Trump ha indic hi displeasur withAT&T Inc.' (NYSE:T) propos acquisit ofTim Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). Might thi mean he'll be more of an activist? If so, there could certainli be a dampen in tech, which ha alreadi seen lot of dealmaking.Yet there is one area where the impact of Donald Trump on tech stock could be the most impactful: taxes. Over the years, tech compani have stash substanti amount oversea to take advantag of low-cost tax havens. But as for Donald Trump, he want to bring back the capit - such as by levi onli a 10% rate.Whil it' unclear the amount that are overseas, it doe look like it isov $2 trillion. It' also import to note thatstudi have shownthat repatri program often result in mostli dividend payout and share buybacks.Again, all thi is not to somehow impli that chang will be immediate. When it come to tax law, the process can be grinding. But in light of the fact that Donald ha shown a penchant for savvi tax plan with hi own businesses, it would not be surpris that he'd give prioriti to repatriation.Th 7 Best Dividend Stock to Buy for 2017OK then, what are some of the tech stock that could benefit? Well, here' a look at three:Tech Stock to Buy: Appl (AAPL)Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashOf course, AAPL ha the biggest hoard of oversea cash, with a whopping$238 billion. Thi repres 40% of the overal market cap.So if Appl could bring back the cash, a good first move would be to boost the dividend, which is at a paltri 2.1%. There would also be lot of firepow left for aggress share buybacks.And what about M&A? The compani ha a histori of avoid dealmaking. But go forward, thi may change. AAPL could use it cash hoard to move aggress into categori like social media, stream video, machin learn and perhap even cloud comput for the enterprise.Yet even if the compani doe not do such things, it may not matter anyway. The fact is that the iPhon franchis still remain an extrem power business. It should continu to provid lush cash flow for some time to come, as AAPL stock ha signific competit advantages, such as a premium global brand, a network of retail store and a robust ecosystem of supplier and developers.Of course, the blunder ofSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) with it own Galaxi Note smartphon should also be a spur of demand for Appl products.

For the most part, CEO Satya Nadella ha been savvi with hi big bet on cloud computing. He ha also made tough decisions, such as to write off the disastrousNokia Corp(ADR)(NYSE:NOK) acquisition.But hey, if there is repatriation, MSFT could get anoth nice boost. Keep in mind that the compani ha about $110 billion in oversea accounts. So yes, Microsoft may want to boost the dividend, which is current yield about 2.7%.But M&A is also like to be critical. Already, MSFT ha been make bold deals, as seen with the $26.2 billion acquisit ofLinkedIn Corp(NYSE:LNKD). But at the same time, the compani will like need to continu to make substanti capit invest for it cloud infrastructure.And the market opportun is massive.

I'll give you a hint: that' how much, on average, passiv ""managed"" mutual fund giantVanguard Groupcollect in manag fee annually. Sinc Vanguard is not a publicli trade entity, the actual revenu number are held pretti close to the vest.But the math come out to be $6.8 billion in fee base on the averag Vanguard fund expens ratio of 0.19%.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');So, while the fund compani pride itself on be sharehold owned, and pound the tabl on pass valu to the investor, make no mistake, Vanguard is a busi and a profit one at that. And whileVanguard founder John Bogl is nowher close to be a Wall Street fat cat, hi tenur at the compani made him an incred wealthi man by most standards.Th other day while drive in to work, I listen to an interview with Mr. Bogl on Bloomberg radio, as always, trumpet hi case for cheap, passiv index investing. He complained, like most of us, of the low-rate, low-growth environment. He said that the stock market is overvalu with a forward P/E of 20-plu (most estim put it closer to 18), dividend yield bare around 2%, and U.S. econom growth under 2%.Accord to him, the best solut for investor is to - drum roll pleas - put their money in a low-cost index fund. Shocker.Now, I do agre with Mr. Bogl that yield are terribl low, and there' no argument that U.S. econom growth is anem at best. Is the market overvalued? Like always, some part are and some aren't. But that doesn't mean investor should just accept a broad-brush vision and settl as Mr. Bogl would have them.Above-market earn growth and S&P-beat dividend yield are out there.

Look in the rearview mirror, CSCO ha grown earn per share (EPS) at a consist averag annual rate of 7.1% while boost their cash dividend an averag of 35% per year. Go forward, EP is expect to grow an averag of 10% annual over the next two fiscal years.

Look forward two years, project call for averag annual EP growth of 33.5%. ABBV trade close to $62 with a 12.28 forward P/E and a 4.18% dividend yield.Risk To Consider:Despit my optim and the compel number these three compani have delivered, all three face signific econom headwinds. ABBV is experienc difficulti with the obviou regulatori stagnat caus by Obamacare, IP need real econom and consum growth, and Cisco ha a heavi relianc on capit spend which is often hard to find.

Thi mean that if sale Apple' iDevic continu falling, Broadcom' wireless busi (27% of last quarter' revenues) could take a hit.However, Broadcom estim that the unit will post 30% sequenti growth in the current quarter on the strength of it unnam ""North American smartphon customer"" (most like Apple). Meanwhile, Broadcom' wire infrastructur busi (54% of revenues) will like keep grow on robust demand for switching, routing, and fiber optic solutions. It industri segment, which includ an IP licens business, also post double-digit annual sale growth last quarter.Broadcom' softest spot is it enterpris storag business, which report a 10% annual sale declin last quarter due to gener weak in the data storag market. But look ahead, analyst expect Broadcom to post 94% sale growth thi year (inflat by merg with Avago), and 23% growth in 2017. On the bottom line, Broadcom' earn are expect to rise 25% thi year and 20% next year.Buyback and dividendsOv the past 12 months, Qualcomm spent $3.3 billion on buyback and $3 billion on dividends, compar to it free cash flow of $6.9 billion dure that period. However, Qualcomm fund most of thosebuyback with debt, and it' unclear how it $47 billion purchas of NXP will impact that strategi in the future. Qualcomm current pay a forward dividend yield of 3.2%. It' like to keep rais that dividend annually, as it ha done so for the past 13 years.Broadcom gener $2 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, but it spent just $272 million on buyback and $653 million on dividends. It also pay a much lower forward yield of 1.2%. Broadcom ha rais that dividend annual for the past six years.Th valuat and verdictQualcomm trade at 20 time earnings, which is slightli lower than the industri averag of 22 for the broad line semiconductor companies. Broadcom' P/E is neg due to the cost of the merger, but it trade at 13 time forward earn compar to Qualcomm' forward P/E of 14.It' a close call between the two chipmakers, but I believ that Qualcomm' higher dividend, more gener buybacks, and it purchas of NXP put it in a better posit to grow than Broadcom. However, Broadcom' well-diversifi business, lower valuation, and solid top and bottom line growth still make it a solid long-term semiconductor play.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Better Buy: Cisco Systems Inc. or Oracle Corporation?,10/26/2016,"Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andOracle(NYSE: ORCL) are often consid dusti ""old tech"" stock that are own for incom instead of growth. But with the market hover near histor highs, both stock might appeal to investor look for more conserv play that can weather the eventu downturn. But is one of these play better than the other? Let' compar these companies' core strength and weak to decide.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Cisco' strength and weaknessesLast year, nearli half of Cisco' revenu came from sale of router and switch . Both are slow-growth busi -- router sale fell 4% last year as switch sale stay flat. Both busi face three major headwinds: sluggish enterpris spending, competit from cheaper rival likeHuawei, and the rise of cloud-bas network solut reduc the need for tradit router and switches.To diversifi away from those two businesses, Cisco ha aggress expand into higher-growth market like cybersecur and servic provid video. However, it double-digit growth in those two market isn't significantli boost it overal revenue, which is expect to rise just 1% thi year. Earnings, boost by buybacks, are expect to rise 3%.Oracle' strength and weaknessesOracle' core busi of databas and hardwar are also slow-growth ones. Both busi face similar headwind as Cisco -- weak enterpris spending, macro headwinds, and a market shift toward more scalabl cloud-bas services.In response, Oracl ha been pivot it age busi toward cloud-as-a-servic platforms. Last quarter, Oracle' combin cloud and on-premis softwar revenues, which account for nearli 80% of it top line, rose 5% annual to $6.8 billion. Total cloud revenues, which includ it Saa (softwar as a service), Paa (platform as a service), and Iaa (infrastructur as a service) platforms, rose 59% to $969 million. But like Cisco, that double-digit growth isn't significantli boost it total revenu or earnings, which are respect expect to climb about 1.5% and 1% thi year.Which stock is fundament cheaper?Cisco current trade at 14 time earnings, which is much lower than the industri averag of 25 for network equip makers. Oracl ha a P/E of 18, which is also a discount to the averag P/E of 54 for the applic softwar industry. Both stock also trade at a discount to the S&P 500' current P/E of 25.Look ahead, analyst expect Cisco to grow it earn by 9% annual over the next five years. That estim give it a 5-year PEG (price to earn growth) ratio of 1.3. Oracle' earn are expect to rise about 8% per year dure that same period, give it a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.9. Sinc a PEG ratio under 1 is consid ""cheap,"" neither Cisco nor Oracl look undervalu rel to their earn growth potenti -- but Cisco look cheaper.Dividend and buybacksCisco ha hike it dividend annual for five consecut years, while Oracl ha done the same for four. However, Cisco' forward yield of 3.5% is much higher than Oracle' 1.6% yield. Over the past 12 months, Cisco spent 38% of it free cash flow in dividends, while Oracl spent 20%. Thi indic that Oracl ha more room to rais it dividend, yet it pay a lower yield than Cisco.However, Oracl favor buyback over dividend -- it spent 65% of it FCF on buyback over the past 12 months, while Cisco onli spent 22%. Cisco' more conserv use of it FCF on dividend and buyback give it more cash to pursu big acquisitions. Both compani are heavili focus on inorgan growth -- Cisco acquir (or announc plan to acquire) 11 compani over the past 12 months, while Oracl acquir nine smaller players.Th winner: CiscoCisco isn't an excit stock, but it lower valuation, higher dividend, and prefer for use it FCF on dividend and acquisit instead of buyback make it a better long-term play in my book. Oracl isn't a terribl investment, butplenti of other""matur tech"" compani have better upcom catalyst and higher dividends.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Rumor ha it that HP Enterpris will announc addit job cuts, though a spokesperson said it simpli follow through with it exist restructur plan.Cisco is also go through a transformation, which explain it own round of layoff that began thi quarter. As mani as 5,500 employees, equal to 7% of Cisco' global workforce, will be let go.

In fact, it ha set the ambiti target of gener free cash flow per share even if thepric of goldwer to fall to $1,000 per ounce.Through the first half of the year -- dure which the averag spot price of gold wa $1,221 per ounc -- the compani ha perform well, report $455 million in free cash flow.Imag source: Getti Images.In fact, the second quarter of 2016 mark the fifth consecut quarter in which Barrick ha report free cash flow. And with the price of gold hover around $1,300 per ounc in the third quarter, expect Barrick to improv it streak to six consecut quarters.Manag attribut it free cash flow growth, in larg part, to it abil to consist lower capit expenditures; however, on the Q2 confer call, it indic that capex spend will rise in the second half of the year. And thi won't be the onli factor compromis free cash flow growth. Barrick' CFO, Catherin Raw, state on the call that the third quarter is expect to be the highest in term of all-in sustain cost for the year.Elabor on digitizationLastly, investor should expect manag to address Barrick' recent partnership withCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) to -- as state in the press releas -- ""drive Barrick' digit reinvention."" Work togeth at the Cortez mine in Nevada, the two compani will deploy sens technolog throughout the mine to produc real-tim oper data.Th digit of the Cortez mine is expect to improv not onli environment and safeti perform but also the manag of energy, water, and emissions. Consist with management' long-term vision for the company, the digit reinvent of Barrick is meant ""to help Barrick deliv on it vision of grow free cash flow per share over the long term.""Dur the Q2 earn presentation, manag provid improv full-year guidanc for Cortez, estim the mine' AISC to fall between $520 and $550 per ounce. It will be interest to see if manag further improv upon the guidanc in light of the partnership with Cisco and when it expect to deploy thi technolog at ani of it other mines.Th takeawayWith it eye on reduc debt and grow free cash flow, Barrick' manag is clearli work to secur the company' long-term success, and I'd be surpris if the company' third-quart earn don't reflect the fruit of thi labor. Though there may be a slowdown in the rate at which the compani is grow free cash flow, I expect the compani to remain on track to achiev it goal of reduc debt by $2 billion for 2016.One addit thing I'll be look for is an updat on the temporari closur of the company' Veladero mine. Though it had initi suggest that the closur wouldn't have a materi impact on the company' earnings, manag ha not recent reaffirm thi position, so it'll be interest to see if manag provid further commentary.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

VR & AR World And Broadband World Forum Highlights,10/24/2016,"ByEdward Schneider, CFA:I attend the inauguralVR & AR Worldconfer as well as the 16th annualBroadband World Forum(BBWF) at the ExCel Centr in London from Octob 18th to Octob 20th. VR (virtual reality) & AR (augment reality) World wa ""virtually"" thrive with excit and potential, but wa a bit short on current econom reality. In contrast, BBWF wa a more mundan event, but with establish carrier budget in the billion of dollar behind the scene make bet in area likeG.fast.G.fast is a digit subscrib line [DSL] protocol for high-spe broadband transmiss of around 300MB/second over copper lines. G.fast speed advantag run out of steam beyond one kilometer. The cost is quit high, however, to rip out copper line at the last kilomet of a network and replac it with super-fast optic fiber lines. British Telecom (BT) estim it would cost about £29B ($35B) to replac it copper line with fiber. BT plan to limit these optic fiber replac costs, by spend onli £6B ($7B) through 2020, retrofit the last kilomet with G.fast processor and equipment. Beneficiari of G.fast includ compani like Broadcom, now part of Avago (AVGO), as well as ADTRAN (ADTN). While G.fast is slower than optic fiber, it is much faster than the 30MB-50MB/second speed that most DSL consum have today. G.fast, in fact, can be a conduit for million of consum to enjoy the new world of VR & AR.BBWF repres a more matur carrier and network infrastructur industry, where carrier network spend is project to decreas 3% in 2016. Thi carrier spend slowdown in part reflect the begin of a shift to softwar defin network (SDN) and network function virtual (NFV), and away from tradit rout equip from vendor such as Cisco (CSCO). Beneficiari of thi long-tail transit to SDN and NFV includ Red Hat (RHT) which provid open-sourc Linux integr for cloud infrastructure, span OpenStack and software-defin networking. For more color on SDN and NFV, pleas refer to mylatest articleon thi subject.makeArticleAd();In contrast, VR & AR is just at the begin of a long journey, in a market that is expect to grow from a small base today to sever billion dollar by 2020. FutureSourc project VR content alon to reach $6B by 2020. Ovum forecast the total VR market to reach $285B by 2020. In my opinion, 2020 VR & AR revenu will be a fraction Ovum' estimate. Nonetheless, the dynam growth potenti of the VR & AR market is evident.Today, consum are just becom awar of virtual and augment reality, mainli through games. Thi summer' Pokemon craze put AR on the map, albeit in a dumbed-down version. To increas awar and make VR & AR more widespread, a few thing need to happen.First, the price-point need to come down to mass-market levels. Valve/HTC (2498.TW) VR headsetVive($800 ASP) and the soon-to-be-releasedMeta 2($949 ASP) AR headset are move closer to critical-mass price points. Microsoft (MSFT)Hololens($3000 ASP) had some impress featur such as move and chang virtual object with your hands, but is still price too high for most consumers. First-mov Facebook (FB)Oculu Rift($800 ASP includ Oculu Touch) is also help to creat a viabl VR market. But $800 headset are still out of reach for mani consumers.To be fair, there are some lower-priced, gener less-advanc headset includ Soni (SNE)PlaySt VR($400 ASP plu PlayStat console), Samsung (SSNLF)Gear VR($200 ASP includ control plu smartphone, co-design with Oculus), Googl (GOOG) (GOOGL)Daydream($100 ASP plu smartphone), LG (LGEAF)360 VR($250 ASP plu smartphone), and ZeissVR One($150 ASP plu smartphone). I wa impress with HumanEy Technologies' Vuze 360 degre immers audio/video camera and advanc video-edit stitch technology. I would categor these technolog as quasi-VR, although they have the most near-term potential. Accord to Digitimes, shipment of VR-enabl smartphon are expect to soar to 70 million unit in 2016, account for 5% of global smartphon shipments.Second, content need to improv for wider-scal monetization. Vive ha been on the market for six months. Dure that time, Vive partner with variou game companies, two of which have alreadi achiev revenu in excess of $1M. As the breadth and qualiti of the game improve, the market will grow. Today, the VR & AR market are still miss the killer app or game beyond Pokemon that will realli spike the growth curve. Epic Games/Tenc Holdings' (TCEHY)Robo Recallto be launch in Q1 2017 potenti could be a killer game.Third, the hardwar need to step up. The latenc ha to come down to the milliseconds, the power consumpt need to declin dramatically, field of vision need to expand to closer to 180 degrees, head-set weight and size need to shrink, augment display technolog need to improve, and telecom network need to be abl to transmit these VR & AR featur to consumers. Encouragingly, progress on these front wa demonstr at the trade show. TheLighthous laser trackingfor virtual navig insid Vive is especi impressive.I chair an Innov Panel at VR & AR World, with Christian Brändli ofInsightness, Vitali Ponomarev ofWayRayand Domin Eskofi ofNvidia(NVDA). Insight make event-bas visual posit modul that process pixel like the human brain. The company' Silicon Eye vision sensor and proprietari process algorithm lead to exponenti faster imag processing/low power consumption, while provid 3D spatial awar of where you are. Insight can enabl next-gener AR and VR hardwar to meet the low power consumption, fast millisecond respons times, and focal posit to creat a better end-us experience. WayRay build AR car windshield navig systems. The company' uniqu holograph and inerti sensor technology, enabl longer and wider field of view than exist today. WayRay should be a boon to the bud driverless car market.Nvidia GeForce, Quadro and Tegra graphic processor unit (GPUs) are the engin for high-end gaming, includ VR & AR. Nvidia, via it Tesla and GRID chips, also ha a fast-grow artifici intellig [AI] business. Nvidia face competit from a number of GPU competitor like Advanc Micro Devic (AMD) in gaming. For AI market like data centers, high-perform comput and driverless cars, Nvidia face competit from GPU-bas Nirvana/Intel (INTC), Intel from the comput process field, CEVA (CEVA) from the digit signal processor angle, ARM/SoftBank (SFTBF) and ThinCI. While Nvidia chips' parallel process capabl are impressive, Nvidia' key competit advantag may be provid softwar engin well-docu platform for build applic on top of it core processors, such as CUDA for parallel program and G-Sync for displays.Adv in processor and platform (Nvidia), display (WayRay) and imag sensor (Insightness) can help VR & AR hardwar reach it potential. Nvidia would be the publicly-quot way to broadli access the futur growth of VR, AR and AI, although the stock is not cheap.Visionari espous the potenti of VR & AR in the come decade. Huawei' Richard Li saw three main VR & AR market - video, game and onlin shopping. Video and game have the largest potenti accord to Mr. Li. For VR gaming, Mr. Li estim 216M gamer gener $11.5B in revenu by 2025. Shop ha potential, but will requir high-bandwidth real-tim interact with objects.Meta' Ryan Pamplin provid a vivid view of an augment and virtual realiti future. He pictur hardwar devic to be 3D (not flat), wide viewing, have interact sculpt of virtual objects, with the abil to turn on and off applic layer that are contextu relev to the user. By 2020, the form factor will be small enough to put on glass or lenses, and AR and VR will becom more main-stream from on-lin shop and fashion design to mobil phones. By 2030, Mr. Pamplin said that we will go beyond glass to human brain-deriv images, millisecond latency, multi-gigabit throughput, photo-realist optics, all process in the cloud.Se alsoDepomed: A Gift From The Indexerson seekingalpha.com"
Should You Buy Fortinet Inc. On Its Double-Digit Drop?,10/23/2016,"Cybersecur firmFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) ha fallen 13% over the past month, with most of the declin occur after it pre-announc it third quarter earn on Oct. 11. The number initi look decent -- the compani expect revenu to rise 20% to 22% annually, while bill should improv 14% to 16%.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();However, both estim were reduc from higher guidance, and repres a signific slowdown from it 30% revenu growth and 26% bill growth in the previou quarter. It would also repres Fortinet' slowest year-over-year sale growth sinc the fourth quarter of 2013. CEO Ken Xie attribut that slowdown to longer deal cycles, sluggish enterpris spending, sale execut challeng in North America, and macro challeng in Latin America and the U.K.However, Xie declar that the compani remain ""confid in the underli strength of our busi and long-term growth opportunity, and commit to deliv return to our shareholders."" The compani also boost it share buyback plan by $100 million to $300 million. Should investor take advantag of Fortinet' recent swoon to start a position? Let' take a closer look at Fortinet' busi to find out.What doe Fortinet do?Fortinet is the fourth largest network secur applianc vendor in the world afterCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) ,Check Point(NASDAQ: CHKP) , andPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) , in that order. Fortinet serv over 280,000 custom worldwide, includ the ""majority"" of the Fortun 500.Fortinet' core product is a next-gen firewal call Fortigate, which includ network secur applianc connect to it Fortinet Secur Fabric. That ""fabric"" offer end-to-end protect across on-premise, cloud-based, and Internet of Thing (IoT) devices. Fortinet also recent acquir secur firm AccelOp to strengthen it posit in cloud and IoT analytics.Th bear case against FortinetFortinet' third quarter slowdown suggest that it is gradual fall behind it closest rival, Palo Alto Networks. Fortinet' revenu rose 31% in 2015, but analyst expect that growth to slow to 25% thi year and 18% next year. Palo Alto' revenu rose 49% last year, and is expect to grow 33% thi year and 30% next year.Palo Alto is also grow it market share at a faster rate than Fortinet. IDC report that between the second quarter of 2015 and 2016, Palo Alto' share of the network secur applianc market rose from 9.3% to 12.1%. Dure that period, Fortinet' share grew from 8.2% to 9.8%.But even Palo Alto hasn't been growingfast enoughto satisfi investor -- that' whi the stock ha declin 16% thi year. If Palo Alto' growth rate are consid mediocre, it' doubt that investor will embrac Fortinet' slower growth and smaller market share.Fortinet also isn't consist profit on a GAAP basis. It report a GAAP net loss of $1.4 million last quarter, compar to a profit of $0.8 million in the prior year quarter. Like Palo Alto, stock-bas compens (SBC) expens are a major weight on Fortinet' bottom line, gobbl up 22% of it revenu last quarter.Th bull case for FortinetHowever, Fortinet trade at just 4.7 time sales, compar to Palo Alto' P/ ratio of 9.4. Fortinet' P/ ratio also hover near multi-year lows, so itmightrepres a good long-term buy opportun if cybersecur stock rebound on stronger enterpris spending.Source:YChartsFortinet is also sell more subscript bundl with it hardwar to boost it gross margins. That effort ha clearli paid off over the past two years.Source:YChartsMeanwhile, Research and Market estim that the global market of secur applianc will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% between 2016 and 2020, fuel by an increas in data breaches.Whil Fortinet' annual sale growth is slow down, it' unlik to drop to the singl digit for the forese future. With an enterpris valu of $4.4 billion and a clean balanc sheet, Fortinet could also be a lucr takeov target for larger player like Cisco.I it time to buy Fortinet?I believ that Fortinet' lower valuat and consist margin expans make it a more compel buy than Palo Alto. But I also believ that the market for firewal and threat prevent solut is a crowd one, and that Fortinet may struggl to keep pace with it larger rival over the long term.Therefore, I would avoid Fortinet unless it sale growth acceler again. Until that happens, Fortinet will like remain under pressur as investor focu on higher-growth play in the cybersecur sector.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Will Cisco Systems Buy These 2 Security Companies?,10/19/2016,"Network equip giantCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) gener nearli half of it revenu from router and switch -- two highli commoditized, slow growth markets. It rout revenu fell 4% last year as it switch revenu stay flat. IDC also report that Ciscoislosingmarket share in both market to aggress rival likeHuawei.Imag source: Getty.makeArticleAd();In response, Cisco ha been invest heavili in higher growth busi like servic provid video, collaboration, and secur solutions. Secur is the fastest grow busi of the three, post 13% annual sale growth last quarter and account for 4% of Cisco' top line.Ov the past few years, Cisco beef up that busi by acquir secur compani like threat protect firm ThreatGRID, SourceFire, OpenDNS, and Lancope. But look ahead, mani analyst expect Cisco to dip into it free cash flow ($12.4 billion over the past 12 months) and make addit purchas across the cybersecur sector. Let' take a closer look at the two most like targets.FireEyeFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) is frequent cite as a takeov target for Cisco, sinc it' a ""best in breed"" threat prevent firm which wa notabl the first cybersecur compani to be certifi by the U.S. Depart of Homeland Security. Buy FireEy would strengthen Cisco' secur portfolio, and the compani could bundl all these technolog directli into it network hardwar and software. These bundl could widen it moat against rival like Huawei andHPE.FireEy hasplung 60%over the past 12 month due to slow sale growth, jar manag changes, and it alarm cash burn rate. But it now ha a fairli low enterpris valu of $1.9 billion -- not a bad price for a compani that gener $623 million in revenu last year. Moreover, FireEye' revenu are still expect to rise 16% thi year and 15% next year. FireEy is unprofitable, but it oper cost would probabl declin dramat after be integr into Cisco' secur unit.However, FireEyereportedli rebuffedsever takeov attempt earlier thi year, becaus it suitor offer less than the $30 per share (140% higher than it current price) it wanted. It' also believ that Kevin Mandia, the company' new CEO, is less interest in sell the compani than hi predecessor, David DeWalt.Imag source: Getty.ImpervaOv the summer, sever report claim that Cisco' channel partner were urg it to buyImperva(NYSE: IMPV) ,the leaderin the nich market of web applic firewal (WAF) which shield individu app from special attacks. Sandler Research estim that the WAF market could grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% between 2014 and 2019.Speak toCRN, an unnam Cisco Gold solut provid suggest that buy Imperva would help Cisco ""fill in some key holes"" toward becom an end-to-end secur provider. Greg Kushto, director of Secur and Enterpris Network at Forc 3, also toldCRNthat Imperva excel in area where Cisco is weak, includ data security, encryption, and data masking.Lik FireEye, share of Imperva have slump nearli 30% over the past 12 month due to slow sale growth, mainli attribut to extend sale cycl and the smaller size of larger purchases. Analyst expect Imperva' sale to rise less than 7% thi year to $250 million befor possibl acceler back to 20% next year.But unlik FireEye, Imperva is still tri to sell itself.Bloombergclaim that Cisco andIBMhav both express interest in buy the company, which ha a fairli low enterpris valu of $1.3 billion. Imperva also face pressur from activist investor Elliot Associates, which hold a stake of nearli 10% in the company, to explor ""strateg and oper opportunities"" like a potenti sale.Wil Cisco buy these companies?It seem more like for Cisco to buy Imperva than FireEye, sinc it' actual look to sell. But I also wouldn't rule out a hostil bid for FireEye, sinc the compani is much cheaper than mani of it peer with an EV/Sal ratio of around 3. Imperva, for example, ha an EV/Sal ratio of 5.Investor should never buy a struggl compani in anticip of a buyout, but FireEy and Imperva' ""best in breed"" strength and beaten-down price could be too tempt for compani like Cisco to ignore.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

3 Top Stocks for Your Roth IRA,10/19/2016,"Imag source: Getti Images.Build up a nest egg onli to have it tax into oblivion at retir is a problem that a Roth IRA solves. Contribut aren't deductible, but that money grow tax-free, potenti for decades, and withdraw after reach the requir age are free and clear of ani tax or penalties.makeArticleAd();Both capit gain and dividend can accumul tax-fre in a Roth IRA, a fact that make some stock better than others. We ask three of our contributor to discuss a stock that would be a perfect fit for a Roth IRA due to their growth potential. Here' what they had to say.Put my mouth where my money isTyl Crowe:I guess there is no better way to suggest a compani for a Roth IRA than to say that it is a hold in my own Roth IRA:Wast Management(NYSE: WM) . What make Wast Manag a compel stock to own in a Roth is two fold. The first is that it is a busi that is like to be around for a long time. The wast handl busi is extrem difficult to disrupt becaus of the amount of capit need to get a busi larg enough to compete. Then, there is the tricki regulatori and slightli polit aspect that give establish busi a big advantag -- think tri to get the permit for a new landfill. With that competit advantag platform, Wast Manag ha built a busi that gener high rate of return and use those return to reward shareholders.So Wast Management' busi certainli ha the qualiti you want for a long-term hold in a retir account. The other reason thi one is worth ad to a Roth IRA is you get to use the tax advantag of the account to benefit even more from the company' dividend. While the company' 2.6% dividend yield today won't wow anyone, the compani ha grown it payout at a decent clip of 6.5% annual over the past 12 year and ha bought back 24% of all share outstand over that time frame. The effort from the compani to increas sharehold valu through these mean and thebenefit of reinvest dividendsin a tax advantag account can do wonder for your retir portfolio. That' whi I own it in my Roth IRA, and whi you should consid it as well.Everyon should own at least one rare diseas drugmakerGeorg Budwell:Novel drug or therapi that target rare diseas are perhap the most covet type of asset within the high growth pharmaceut industry. The basic issu at play is that so-cal ""orphan"" drugs, or drug indic for diseas that afflict fewer than 200,000 people, come with a varieti of benefit for their manufacturers, includ premium prices, littl to no push back from payers, extend period of exclusivity, tax breaks, and arguabl less competition, depend on the indication. Orphan drugs, on balance, also tend to requir far less capit to bring to market, enabl their manufactur to avoid take on the unsightli amount of debt that frequent plagu small to mid-siz biopharmas.With these advantag in mind, I think the mid-cap orphan drug specialistBioMarin(NASDAQ: BMRN) would be a great stock to sock away in a Roth IRA. BioMarin present ha five drug on the market for orphan indications, such as the carbohydr process disord Morquio A, as well as for Phenylketonuria, a condit character by a person' inabl to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. BioMarin also sport an excit clinic pipelin of high-valu orphan drug candid for condit like short-limb dwarfism and hemophilia A.Asid from BioMarin' divers product portfolio and clinic pipeline, the compani is also set to post some of the highest level of revenu growth within the pharmaceut industry. Specifically, the drugmaker' top line is forecast to grow by over 26% thi year, and by more than 18% in 2017. And if you throw in the fact that BioMarin ha rel littl leverag on it balanc sheet, with a modest debt to equiti ratio of 34.9%, thi stock looks, like a superb growth vehicl to hold for the long haul.A bargain tech dividend stockTim Green:Th ideal stock for a Roth IRA is one that pay a hearti dividend and ha the potenti to appreci in valu over the long run.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , the domin leader in the network hardwar market, check both boxes.Cisco is undergo a transformation, shift away from be a seller of hardwar and toward be a provid of solutions.Softwar and serviceswil be the key to the company' growth go forward, with area like secur and collabor offset slow growth in the switch and rout businesses. In fiscal year 2016, while the switch busi wa flat and the rout busi suffer a small revenu decline, secur and collabor grew by 13% and 9%, respectively.What makesCisco stockent is a pessimist valuat and a nice dividend. Analyst expect Cisco to produc adjust EP of $2.43 in fiscal year 2017, put the forward P/E ratio at just 12.5. If you valu the net cash on Cisco' balanc sheet fulli and back it out, that ratio drop to just 9.5. Add to that low valuat a dividend yield of 3.4%, and the result is a stock that deserv a place in your Roth IRA.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

The 3 Biggest Challenges Facing Cisco Systems,10/18/2016,"Network giantCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) isn't a high growth stock, but it' gener consid a solid incom play which deliv fairli predict return in volatil markets. Cisco' P/E of 14 is lower than the industri averag of 25 for network equip companies, and it forward yield of 3.5% is higher than the S&P 500' averag yield of 2.1%.Imag source: Cisco.makeArticleAd();Whil those number will like set a floor under Cisco' stock, a few headwind could also prevent it from move much higher. Let' discuss three of those biggest challenges.1. Competit in switch and routersCisco is the world' largest vendor of ethernet switch and routers. However, it' been lose market share in both market to rival likeHuaweiandHPE(NYSE: HPE) . IDC report that between the first and second quarter of 2016, Cisco' share of the switch market fell from 59% to 56.8%, and it share of the combin router and servic provid market slip from 48.8% to 44.8%.That' a big problem, sinc Cisco' combin switch and router revenu account for nearli half of it top line last year. In the past, Cisco margin smaller rival like Aruba Network with aggress hardwar and softwar bundl tactics. But now that mani of the smaller player have either been beaten or acquired, larger compani are strike back with their own bundl plays.Huawei, the largest wireless infrastructur compani in the world, is leverag that lead market posit to sell switch and router to telco and larg businesses. HPE, which acquir Aruba last year to increas it scale in both switch and routers, is also bundl it network hardwar with variou other IT services.2. The rise of cloud networkingA newer challeng for Cisco is the rise of cloud network solut which reli more on softwar instead of hardware. These platforms, also known as SDN (software-defin networking) ones, are often more cost effici and scalabl than older hardware-bas networks.Last year, Credit Suiss analyst Kulbind Garcha declar that SDN platform will simplifi networking, hurt demand for Cisco' tradit network equipment, and ""shrink gross profit dollar for the network stack."" Guggenheim analyst Ryan Hutchinson also warn that Cisco' outlook wa cloud by ""uncertainti around futur network architectur as more workload migrat to the cloud.""Imag source: Getti Images.Cisco' biggest adversari in thi space isArista Networks(NYSE: ANET) , which ha post double-digit sale growth for seven straight quarters. Cisco ha tri to slow Arista down with patent infring lawsuits, which result in import ban on some of it products. The Intern Trade Commiss and U.S. Trade Repres both upheld that ban earlier thi year in separ rulings. That ban throw a few hurdl in Arista' way, but it might not prevent Cisco from fall behind a crucial tech curve.3. Inorgan grow it secur businessCisco' secur revenu rose 13% last year, make it the company' fastest grow business. While the busi mere account for 4% of it top line, Cisco ha been aggress grow it by acquir cybersecur firm like ThreatGRID, SourceFire, OpenDNS, and Lancope. That growth make Cisco an oft-cit threat to smaller cybersecur companies. However, mani smaller player have ""best in breed"" reput in certain market which Cisco lacks.For example,Palo Alto Networks'(NYSE: PANW) firewal are approv by a larg number of agencies, includ the U.S. Depart of Defense. Threat prevent firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) wa the first cybersecur compani to be certifi by the U.S. Depart of Homeland Security.Therefore, instead of develop better secur platform than these leaders, Cisco might need to acquir them instead. That' whi there are persist rumor about Cisco buy smaller player like FireEy orImperva. However, mani of these compani aren't profit and are trade at high valuat -- mean that Cisco' cybersecur expans could be costli rel to the actual revenu and profit it generates.I Cisco still a worthi investment?I believ that Cisco is still a solid long-term investment, thank to it domin posit in the network market, growth opportun in the Internet of Thing and across 5G networks, and expans into higher growth market like servic provid video, collaboration, and secur solutions. However, I also believ investor should care evalu these headwinds, which could caus Cisco' top line growth to remain stagnant over the next few years.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Interesting June 2017 Stock Options for CSCO,10/17/2016,"Consistently, one of the more popular stock peopl enter into theirstock option watchlistat Stock Option Channel is Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO). So thi week we highlight one interest put contract, and one interest call contract, from the June 2017 expir for CSCO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $25 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of 72 cents. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 2.9% return against the $25 commitment, or a 4.3% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to CSCO' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems, Inc. see it share fall 17.6% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $24.28 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the 72 cent from $25), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 4.3% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annual 4.3% figur actual exce the 3.4% annual dividend paid by Cisco Systems, Inc., base on the current share price of $30.32. And yet, if an investor wa to buy the stock at the go market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downsid becaus the stock would have to lose 17.55% to reach the $25 strike price.Alway import when discuss dividend is the fact that, in general, dividend amount are not alway predict and tend to follow the up and down of profit at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems, Inc., look at the dividend histori chart for CSCO below can help in judg whether the most recent dividend is like to continue, and in turn whether it is a reason expect to expect a 3.4% annual dividend yield.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the June 2017 expiration, for sharehold of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) look to boost their incom beyond the stock' 3.4% annual dividend yield. Sell the cover call at the $33 strike and collect the premium base on the 87 cent bid, annual to an addit 4.3% rate of return against the current stock price (thi is what we at Stock Option Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 7.8% annual rate in the scenario where the stock is not call away. Ani upsid abov $33 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but CSCO share would have to advanc 8.8% from current level for that to happen, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 11.7% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Cisco Systems, Inc., highlight in green where the $25 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $33 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the June 2017 put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

"One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Cisco Systems",10/10/2016,"Consistently, one of the more popular stock peopl enter into theirstock option watchlistat Stock Option Channel is Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO). So thi week we highlight one interest put contract, and one interest call contract, from the Novemb expir for CSCO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identifi as particularli interesting, is at the $31 strike, which ha a bid at the time of thi write of 70 cents. Collect that bid as the premium repres a 2.3% return against the $31 commitment, or a 17.9% annual rate of return (at Stock Option Channel we call thi theYieldBoost).Sel a put doe not give an investor access to CSCO' upsid potenti the way own share would, becaus the put seller onli end up own share in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Cisco Systems, Inc. see it share declin 1.6% and the contract is exercis (result in a cost basi of $30.30 per share befor broker commissions, subtract the 70 cent from $31), the onli upsid to the put seller is from collect that premium for the 17.9% annual rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annual 17.9% figur actual exce the 3.3% annual dividend paid by Cisco Systems, Inc. by 14.6%, base on the current share price of $31.49. And yet, if an investor wa to buy the stock at the go market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downsid becaus the stock would have to fall 1.56% to reach the $31 strike price.Alway import when discuss dividend is the fact that, in general, dividend amount are not alway predict and tend to follow the up and down of profit at each company. In the case of Cisco Systems, Inc., look at the dividend histori chart for CSCO below can help in judg whether the most recent dividend is like to continue, and in turn whether it is a reason expect to expect a 3.3% annual dividend yield.Turn to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the Novemb expiration, for sharehold of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CSCO) look to boost their incom beyond the stock' 3.3% annual dividend yield. Sell the cover call at the $32 strike and collect the premium base on the 66 cent bid, annual to an addit 16.6% rate of return against the current stock price (thi is what we at Stock Option Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 19.9% annual rate in the scenario where the stock is not call away. Ani upsid abov $32 would be lost if the stock rise there and is call away, but CSCO share would have to climb 1.6% from current level for that to occur, mean that in the scenario where the stock is called, the sharehold ha earn a 3.7% return from thi trade level, in addit to ani dividend collect befor the stock wa called.Th chart below show the trail twelv month trade histori for Cisco Systems, Inc., highlight in green where the $31 strike is locat rel to that history, and highlight the $32 strike in red:Th chart above, and the stock' histor volatility, can be a help guid in combin with fundament analysi to judg whether sell the Novemb put or call option highlight in thi articl deliv a rate of return that repres good reward for the risks.

In fact, in most high-profil cyberattacks, cloud platform were not part of the IT infrastructur breached.A more busi workload shift to Amazon Web Services, part ofAmazon.com(AMZN), andMicrosoft' (MSFT) Azure, spend on cloud cybersecur is expect to rise.makeArticleAd();So it' no wonder that provid of secur technolog are rush to make acquisitions.Cisco Systems(CSCO) in June acquir privat held CloudLock. In earlier deals, Microsoft bought Adallom;Palo Alto Networks(PANW) snap up CirroSecure;Imperva(IMPV )purchas Skyfence; Blue Coat System grab Elastica, withSymantec(SYMC) in turn acquir Blue Coat;Barracuda Networks(CUDA) bought Sookasa; andFortinet(FTNT) purchas AccelOps.Merg specul and the the rise in cloud-bas secur spend help boost the 26 stock in IBD' secur softwar industri group to a No. 34 rank on Friday amongth 197 industri group track by IBD, up from No. 146 at the start of the third quarter.Doubl Down On CASBMani of the acquisit target the cloud access secur broker (CASB) market. CASB product act as a middleman between a corpor network and cloud applic host externally. CASB servic extend compani secur polici and access control to cloud apps, provid visibl into what software-as-a-servic (SaaS) app are be use in a network, and maintain tight restrict on data transfer.""CASB is about secur the data that goe into the cloud and is becom a critic control of new app that organ are using,"" said Jonathan Ho, an analyst at William Blair.IBD' TAKE:Sever cybersecur stock are on high alert for investor thank to Russian cyberattack and Barracudaearnings.H say secur firm like Palo Alto are sell CASB product in tandem with their on-premis data center products. ""It' an opportun to upsel into your instal base of customers,"" Ho added.CASB product might, for example, identifi suspici behavior such as a person make multipl login to cloud app from differ locations, perhap from a mobil device.""Secur vendor are doubl down on the CASB market,"" said Shaul Eyal, an analyst at Oppenheimer. He say they includ Microsoft, Symantec, Palo Alto, Fortinet,Check Point(CHKP), Imperva,Proofpoint(PFPT) and Barracuda Networks.Ey say CASB will be most import in the Saa market as Microsoft Offic 365,Salesforce.com(CRM),NetSuite(N) and other app are increasingli access via the internet cloud.""CASB is import becaus the use of Saa applic mean more data is be store outsid an organization, ad more risk"" that data will be stolen, he said.Onli 5% of larg organ now use CASB products, but that will grow to 85% by 2020, say market research firm Gartner.""CASB cover what' call 'shadow IT,' when busi user go out and buy servic without IT depart sanctioning, and let the compani recogn when that' happen and regain control over the applications,"" Ho said.Securework andIBM(IBM) also sell CASB products, analyst say. And the CASB market is rife with startup includ BitGlass, CipherCloud, NetSkope, Palerra and Skyhigh Networks, so more acquisit are expected. Still, CASB is new.""Wher CASB fall short is on effect integr with an enterprise' exist secur services, such as it ident access management,"" said Joel Fishbein, an analyst at BTIG.Tackl The Encrypt ProblemWhil CASB is just one cloud-rel develop in next-gener security; there will be others, analyst say.In PwC' 2017 global inform secur report, 63% of survey respond said they now run IT servic in the cloud, in the survey' first year of ask that question.Research firm IDC say that enterpris now spend about 15% of their secur budget on cloud-rel products. That'll rise to 33% by 2018, IDC says. Gartner estim that spend for cloud cybersecur will grow at an annual rate of 19% from 2016 through 2019.Accord to a Citigroup survey of secur professionals, Cisco and Palo Alto were cite as the most ""strateg vendors"" for cloud security, while a Morgan Stanley report say Proofpoint is ""ahead of the curve"" in cloud deployment.Th Citigroup report, publish in September, say that most compani have about 30% to 40% of busi workload outsourc to cloud servic providers. So-cal hybrid clouds, with a mix of privat and public infrastructure, will pose their own set of challenges.""A lot of the challeng with the cloud revolv around the need for manag encrypt and data loss prevention,"" said Robert Ayoub, an analyst at market research firm IDC. ""Compani are evalu what data realli need to be protect in the cloud. It' not simple. Encrypt is challenging, it' a hard problem to tackle.""Ne For Secur Drive Cloud AdoptionOn big question is whether AWS, the lead provid of infrastructure-as-a-servic (IaaS), will sell more secur product of it own and compet directli with softwar secur companies. In the Iaa market, custom rent comput and data storag via the Internet cloud. Microsoft' Azur is the No. 2 Iaa provid whileAlphabet's(GOOGL) Googl is the third biggest.AW ha reli on third-parti secur partners, although it recent roll out it own web-appl firewall.What' clear is that larg compani are get more comfort outsourc busi workload to AW and Microsoft' Azur as secur improves, said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report.Weiss say cloud servic provid typic encrypt data ""at rest and in transit."" In addition, there' no way for hacker to identifi specif server where data is store becaus of public cloud architectures. ""Our recent convers with CIO now suggest secur is a driver of cloud adoption,"" Weiss said in a May report. ""Comput shift to the cloud may mean that cloud platform vendor themselves, such as Amazon and Microsoft, are best posit to provid the secur functionality,"" he added.Whil AW and Microsoft could develop secur product internally, they also loom as potenti acquirers, especi of startups.Sandboxing, and Other Cloud AdvantagesTher are opportun for incumb in cloud cybersecurity, analyst say.Secur vendor typic sell stand-alon ""appliances"" that hous software, electron and network tools. Analyst expect more secur compani to offer software-only, or ""virtualized"" version of product sold through AW or Microsoft Azure. Goldman Sach say demand may grow for virtual firewal in the public cloud in 2017.Proofpoint, an email secur specialist, andFireEye(FEYE) have develop security-as-a-servic platforms.CyberArk Software' product give employe or administr who have ""privileg accounts"" the abil to access comput system in public cloud settings. Barracuda ha roll out offer for Offic 365 user in the public cloud.Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard say cloud-bas ""sandboxing"" could play a role in threat detection.Sandbox technology, first from FireEy and now with mani suppliers, execut suspici code in an isol environ to test if a program contain a viru or malware. ""The malwar problem is easier to solv in the cloud, with a virtual network to isol infect host and use cloud comput capac to run algorithm to detect malware,"" Pritchard said in a Septemb report.Gartn analyst Lawrenc Pingre say cloud-bas servic usual offer a discount.""Cloud-bas malwar sandbox have been introduc by mani firewal providers, and mani are offer at a fraction of the cost of lead standalon devices,"" Pingre said in an email.Cloud-bas sandbox may play a role in identifi so-cal ""zero day"" threats. That' when hacker exploit vulner in softwar code by infiltr malwar into networks. The attack are call ""zero day"" becaus develop race the clock to patch secur holes.A More Cautiou Secur Market""Enterpris will continu to invest in new cloud-ori product (virtual appliances), security-as-a-servic products, and new functionality, such as CASB,"" said Gabriela Borges, a Goldman Sach analyst in a report. ""We think incumb vendor will pick up the pace in invest in these areas, most like through M&A activity.""Spend on secur ha been grow amid tighter inform technolog (IT) budgets.Corpor spend on secur ha been grow at about a 6% annual rate while IT budget have been flattish. Even so, secur remain onli roughli 4% to 10% of overal IT budgets, depend on the compani size, analyst say.""You'r just not go to get where secur is 25% of the IT budget,"" said IDC' Ayoub. ""There are just too mani oper piec that are compet for resources.""Aft a slew of high-profil data breach in 2013-14, mani compani rush to upgrad firewal that sit between privat network and the internet and invest in threat detect technologies. Firewal block unauthor traffic from enter a privat network by analyz app ""signatures.""That uptick in ""crisi spending"" drove secur softwar stock to fresh high in mid-2015 as valuat soared.

3 Tech Stocks I Never Plan to Buy,10/6/2016,"Mani tech investor chase high-growth stocks, but other like to bottom-fish for contrarian bargains. However, it' import to recogn the differ between a broken stock and a broken compani -- the former might recover, while the latter might not. Let' examin three such broken compani which I never plan to buy.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();InvenSenseInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) make motion sensor for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and other devices. While those sound like solid growth markets, the compani respect gener 40% and 16% of it sale fromApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsunglast year. Peak sale of both companies' mobil devic are weigh down InvenSense' revenue, which is expect to declin 24% thi year and anoth 52% next year.To make matter worse, InvenSens face fierc competit from larger rival likeSTMicroelectronics(NYSE: STM) andBosch. Appl instal STMicro' motion sensor instead of InvenSense' into the Appl Watch last year -- rais concern that Appl would eventu use STMicro' motion sensor for it flagship iO devices.InvenSens tri to offset that loss by diversifi into virtual realiti headset and Internet of Thing gadgets, but both rival are expand into the same markets.Facebook' Oculu Rift, for example, use Bosch' motion sensors. Thi ongo competit pressur could eventu crush InvenSense' margins. InvenSens wa unprofit by both non-GAAP and GAAP measur last quarter, and it loss could keep widen due to slow sale and rise competition.FireEyeCybersecur firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) provid threat detect servic which monitor the perimet of enterpris networks. Thi market is a grow one due to rise data breaches, but it' satur with mani rival like next-gen firewal providerPalo Alto Networksand network equip giantCisco' bundl secur services.Imag source: FireEye.That competit caus FireEye' sale to rise just 19% annual last quarter, compar to 34% growth in the previou quarter and 56% growth in the prior year quarter. FireEy expect sale to rise just 15% to 17% thi year, compar to 46% growth in 2015. The compani attribut that slowdown to it shift from on-sit applianc to it new cloud-bas platform, FireEy as a Servic (FaaS). Applianc gener revenu immediately, but subscription-bas Faa revenu are recogn over longer period of time.But with sale growth slow down, FireEye' net loss will like widen -- and it hefti stock-bas compens expens (35% of it revenu in the first half of 2015) could prove unsustainable. The company' cash and equival also fell from $402 million at the end of 2015 to $184 million last quarter -- rais the possibl of addit secondari or convert debt offerings.To top it off, FireEye' longtim CFO Michael Sheridan resign last Juli amid cash burn concerns, and CEO Dave DeWalt resign in June. FireEye' new CEO Kevin Mandia want to cut cost to improv profit -- but that strategi could reduc it competit and result in even slower sale growth.SeagateSeagate(NASDAQ: STX) ha constantli struggl with declin sale of it core HDD (hard disk drives), which are be replac by smaller, faster, and more power-effici SSD (solid state drives) -- which the compani lack a meaning presenc in. The ongo slowdown in PC sale ha also exacerb that decline.Imag source: Pixabay.Seagate' revenu fell 19% in 2015, and analyst expect it top line to fall anoth 5% thi year due to weak PC sale and demand from data centers. It earn are expect to rise 35% thi year, partial recov from it 84% declin last year. Those forecast sound bullish, but they'r inflat by easi year-over-year comparison and buybacks.Seag reli heavili on buybacks, spend over $1 billion on debt-fund buyback over the past 12 months. To make matter worse, it' promis to keep pay it forward dividend yield of 6.5% -- which look unsustain rel to it earn payout ratio of almost 300%. Meanwhile, low interest rate have caus investor to flock to high-yield stock like Seagate, boost it trail P/E to 47 -- a steep premium to the industri averag of 19 for data storag companies.Seag also refus to make a major acquisition, likeWestern Digital' purchas of SanDisk, to remain relev in the flash storag and SSD markets. Instead, CEO Steve Luczo convinc activist investor ValueAct Capit to take a big stake in the compani and help the compani turn around it data storag business. That bizarr move indic that Luczo simpli doesn't have a clear plan for Seagate' future.Th bottom lineInvenSense, FireEye, and Seagat all still have bullish supporters, but I'm not buy their turnaround stories. InvenSens remain at the merci of larger rivals, FireEy is shrink it busi when it need to expand, and Seagat is tread water with big buyback and unsustain dividends. Therefore, investor should look elsewher for better contrarian plays.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

What Rate Of Return Will An Investment In Johnson & Johnson Deliver? Part 2,10/5/2016,"ByChuck Carnevale:IntroductionI never invest in a common stock without a clear expect of the futur return that it can gener for me. Consequently, I consid thi one of the most import step in my research and due dilig process. Unfortunately, my experi in deal with investor ha led me to conclud that thi import step is rare taken. Most investor possess onli a vagu idea of what they might earn from invest in a given stock. Mani peopl simpli buy a stock hope that it will go up, and if it pay a dividend, hope that the dividend will increas over time.With thi article, I'm go to share my specif process on how I estim the futur return that a stock can be expect to offer me. My primari exampl will be base on a current invest in the blue-chip Dividend Aristocrat Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). Through thi exercise, I will offer a method approach design to determin whether Johnson & Johnson is a viabl invest choic at today' valuation.makeArticleAd();Johnson & Johnson: Forecast Futur ReturnsInpart 1of thi two-part series, I review Johnson & Johnson, Consolid Edison, Inc. (ED) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) from a histor perspective. Review a company' histori and how the market ha typic valu the company' oper result is typic the initi step in my due dilig process. However, I consid forecast the futur potenti of ani compani the most crucial step in my due dilig process.Directli stated, I will never invest in a stock until I have made a determin of what rate of return the invest might potenti produc for me. Thi is essenti done under a most like case, best-cas and worst-cas scenarios. I'm not naïv enough to believ that I can make these calcul with absolut precision. Instead, my object is to determin futur return possibl within reason rang of accuraci and predictability. But most importantly, thi give me more that a vagu idea of what the return potenti that a compani might produc for me. I call thi invest with my eye wide open.However, befor I move on to my forecast process, I would like to briefli review what I saw when I examin Johnson & Johnson' valuat histori over differ time periods. You can examin my histor approach more comprehens by review the link to my previou articl above.In order to review histor valuations, I reli on theF.A.S.T. Graphsfundament analyz softwar tool. I alway start by look at all of the company' histori avail to me. The follow long-term earn and price correl graph on Johnson & Johnson reveal two import aspect relat to valuation. First of all, I notic that the market appli a premium valuat on Johnson & Johnson' share from 1997 through the spring of 2007. However, from that point forward, the market wa valu Johnson & Johnson' share at a lower valuation. I have drawn a line on the graph separ these two time periods. Note that the normal P/E ratio calcul of 20.2 is high becaus it is skew by the high valuat over these first 10 year or so.(click to enlarge)When I shorten thetim frame to cover the period 2006 to current, I discov that the normal P/E ratio that the market ha appli over thistim frame ha been approxim 15. Importantly, I consid these more recent valuat level more relevant. Therefore, my fair valu assess for Johnson & Johnson is set at the more conserv P/E ratio of 15 than at the longer-term normal P/E ratio of 20.2. Consequently, with the current blend P/E ratio at 18.1, I would consid Johnson & Johnson moder overvalu at these levels. As promised, what follow will be the rate of return calcul I believ thi valuat level offers.(click to enlarge)When write articl like this, I can onli includ a pictur of a live, fully-funct graph. Therefore, I have arrang to have a live, fully-funct F.A.S.T. Graph avail to readers. Next I will offer a few simpl calcul util the Forecast Calcul and their calcul functionality. However, the calcul allow me to run numer ""what-if"" calcul base on variou assumptions. If the reader follow the below link, they will be abl to quickli and easili run as mani of their own calcul as they desire.Her is thelinkfor a FAST and FUN Preview of F.A.S.T Graph use the stock symbol JNJOnc you follow the link, scroll down to the Forecast Calcul where you will find five calcul that can be util to estim the futur return potenti on Johnson & Johnson. Each calcul is color-cod and the follow screenshot illustr how to access each calculator. My first calcul will be base on util Johnson & Johnson' normal P/E ratio of 15 (the dark blue tab and border).(click to enlarge)Th calcul is present forecast base on the consensu analyst estim report to S&P Capit IQ. With thi Johnson & Johnson example, there are 23 analyst forecast earn for fiscal year-end Decemb 2016 and 25 analyst forecast earn for fiscal year-end 2017. From there, the number of analyst drop off to 17 analyst for fiscal year-end 2018 and onli 11 analyst for fiscal year-end 2019. Thi inform is found at the bottom of the graph as ""# Analysts.""Assum that these analyst are reason correct, and the company' stock price wa valu at a normal P/E ratio of 15.3 (red circle), then Johnson & Johnson would be expect to deliv a total annual rate of return of onli 3.57% out to Decemb 31, 2019. Personally, I would consid thi too low of a rate of return potenti which is due to moder high current valuation. I consid this, as I will elabor later, my most reason case scenario.(click to enlarge)In contrast, if I ran these calcul util the long-term histor normal P/E ratio of 20.1 (red circle), the invest in Johnson & Johnson look a lot more attractive. Although I would consid thi a possibility, my confid that Johnson & Johnson would trade at that valuat is low. Therefore, I would consid thi more of an optimist or best-cas scenario. Nevertheless, the 11.97% total annual rate of return would be consid attractive.(click to enlarge)At thi point, I'v run these expect and best-cas scenario util the specif consensu analyst estim over the next few years. However, mani investor hold a rather jaundic view of the accuraci of analyst estimates. On some companies, these neg view on analyst estim are justified, however, there are certain compani where the analysts' track record have been exceptional. Johnson & Johnson happen to be one of those compani that analyst have tend to estim correctly.Th follow ""Analyst Scorecard"" summari show that analyst have been accur with their forecast on Johnson & Johnson virtual 100% of the time. Thi record assum a 10% margin of error for forecast made one year in advance, and a 20% margin of error for forecast made two year in advance.(click to enlarge)Thi next screenshot provid a more detail look at the record of analyst make a one year in advanc forecast of earn on Johnson & Johnson. Therefore, I think it is reason to assum two thing about Johnson & Johnson' estimates. One, Johnson & Johnson must be a rel easi compani to make forecast on. Two, in my opinion, sinc analyst reli heavili on compani guidance, Johnson & Johnson' manag must give good solid guidance. However, the main point I am make with these scorecard is that my confid level is high regard the earn forecast in the abov calculators. Therefore, I feel it is highli like that they would turn out to be reason accurate.(click to enlarge)Onc I have run calcul util specif consensu estim for the next few years, I like to examin the return possibl util a longer-term three to five-year trend line calculation. The calcul util to run these calcul would be found on the third tab on the forecast calculators' options.(click to enlarge)Ther are nine analyst (see FAST FACT box to the right of the graph) offer a three to five-year trend line earn growth estim on Johnson & Johnson at 6.07% on average. If those trend line estim happen to come to pass and Johnson & Johnson trade at a P/E ratio of 15 on Decemb 31, 2001, it would onli offer me a 4.8% rate of return. Onc again, I would not be too excit about that long-term rate of return possibl notwithstand Johnson & Johnson' impecc quality.(click to enlarge)On the other hand, if I util that same growth expect but appli the long-term normal P/E ratio of approxim 21, my rate of return potenti would be much more attractive. However, recent histor data suggest that valuat level might be overly-optimistic. Nevertheless, thi would be anoth possibl best-cas scenario.(click to enlarge)Onc I have examin the consensu trend line estim base on analyst report to S&P Capit IQ, I like to check other sourc to see what other analyst think. Therefore, I check the five-year growth forecast on Johnson & Johnson from Morningstar. Here I found a much lower estim for longer-term growth of onli 3.8% on average.""Morningstar Five-Year Growth Forecast""(click to enlarge)Consequently, I then went to the ""Custom"" calcul option and enter a custom trend line growth rate of 3.8% (red circle) accord to Morningstar. Onc again, util the normal P/E ratio of 15, my rate of return calcul on Johnson & Johnson base on Morningstar estim onli averag 2.35% per annum. Perhap thi could be consid a wors case - or mayb even just a bad-cas scenario for thi blue-chip Dividend Aristocrat. Nevertheless, it provid addit insight gener by my due dilig process.(click to enlarge)Additionally, I often like to run rate of return calcul where I util histor earn growth rate in lieu of analyst estimates. Thi is an approach that Ben Graham suggested. Thi next calcul util the ""Histor CAGR"" (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5% (red circle) on averag for Johnson & Johnson over the past five complet histor years. All thing considered, I consid thi 5% growth rate achiev for Johnson & Johnson. Consequently, I would consid thi a plausibl case scenario.(click to enlarge)However, I never stop with just run calcul base on analyst estim or histor earn growth rate on ani compani I am researching. My next step is to check other research provid in order to assess the valid of the assumpt util in my calculations. What follow is one exampl util Morningstar research and it discuss of Johnson & Johnson' econom moat. However, I will check sever other research provid for addit inform as well.""Morningstar Research: Econom Moat07/19/2016W believ Johnson & Johnson carri one of the widest moat in the healthcar sector, support by intellectu properti in the drug group, switch cost in the devic segment, and strong brand power from the consum group.

Further, the compani is not overli depend on one particular oper segment; the pharmaceut business, medic devic group, and consum product repres 40%, 40%, and 20% of total sales, respectively.

The follow excerpt are fromJohnson & Johnson' Second-Quart 2016Earn Presentation:(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)On of the area I am most interest in is the company' earn guidance. The follow slide and the accompani F.A.S.T. Graph Forecast Calcul illustr that the compani guidanc and analysts' estim are aligned. The 2016 earn forecast of $6.69 is in the middl of the guidanc rang provid by Johnson & Johnson.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)Johnson & Johnson - Whi I'm Not SellingAft run the abov return calcul for Johnson & Johnson go forward util variou scenarios, I have conclud that I do not consid Johnson & Johnson a compel invest at today' valuation. However, I make a distinct between make a buy decis versu a sell decision.Th follow histor graph on Johnson & Johnson are mark with a green dot indic the day that I bought thi blue-chip. With the first graph, I have run a calcul of the rate of return I have achiev on my Johnson & Johnson invest thu far. As you can see, thi ha been a veri profit holding. Becaus I purchas the stock when it is undervalued, and consid that it is now moder overvalued, my result have been better than what the compani produc on an oper basis.(click to enlarge)With such a nice profit on my investment, it would be veri tempt to sell and harvest that return. However, one of my primari reason for invest in the stock wa the company' impecc histori of increas it dividend everi year. Consequently, if I sold, I would be give up that futur dividend. But, as previous suggested, I believ in invest with my eye wide open.Therefore, I have run a calcul to see what my rate of return would be if the compani revert to the mean by year-end 2017. Obviously, if that happened, it would be lower. On the other hand, I would still be earn a double-digit return. And of course, there is the possibl that Johnson & Johnson' stock price would maintain it current P/E ratio. Onc I'v establish a solid posit in a great busi like Johnson & Johnson, I am veri reluct to sell unless valuat becom extreme. I don't consid Johnson & Johnson' current valuat extreme; therefore, I plan on continu to hold it for a long time.(click to enlarge)Th Bottom LineI hope the reader recogn that the primari messag I'm attempt to deliv with the abov exercis is to alway invest with your eye wide open. To me, thi mean establish a reason expect of what the busi behind the stock is capabl of delivering, and then calcul a reason rate of return expect on that basis. In other words, never invest on just a hope or a prayer.Follow-Up Exampl From Part 1In part 1 of thi two-part series, I cover two addit companies.

Retired? Here Are 2 Stocks You Should Consider Buying,10/5/2016,"If you recent retired, you'r probabl look for stock with low volatil and high dividends. Low interest rate have recent inflat the valu of manydividend stockstounattract levels, but there are two solid incom invest which I believ retire can still considerbuy --Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andBank of America' Prefer Lshares(NYSE: BAC-L) .Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();An underappreci tech stock with a solid yieldNetwork giant Cisco is onli expect to post 1% sale growth thi year and 3% growth next year. That stagnat is mainli attribut to slow demand for it router and switches, which gener nearli half it revenu last quarter. Router sale slid 6% annual dure the quarter, but switch sale improv just 2%. Meanwhile, newer cloud-bas network solut from compani likeArista Networksthreaten to reduc sale of Cisco' on-sit network hardware.Cisco' core busi might look mediocre, but the compani ha been aggress expand it higher-growth security, servic provid video, and collabor servic businesses. It also ink major enterpris partnership withApple,IBM, andSalesforceto widen it moat against smaller challengers, and made numer acquisit to expand inorgan across the grow Internet of Thing -- which could connect up to 50 billion devic by 2020.Cisco gener plenti of free cash flow ($12.4 billion over the past 12 months) for fund acquisitions, buybacks, and dividends. It respect spent 22% and 38% on buyback and dividend over the past year, indic that it ha plenti of room to increas both to boost sharehold value. Buyback are expect to increas Cisco' earn by 3% thi year and 6% next year. Cisco hike it dividend annual for the past five year and current pay a forward yield of 3.4% -- which is much higher than the S&P 500' averag yield of 2.1%.Lastly, Cisco trade at just 15 time earnings, which is much lower than the industri averag of 25 for network and commun devic companies. That low valuat and it solid yield should set a floor under the stock -- make it a low-risk, long-term invest for most retir portfolios.A prefer stock with unusu benefitsBank of America(NYSE: BAC) offer awid varietyofpref shareswhich are less volatil and pay higher dividend than it common shares. Moreover, if Bank of America becam insolvent, prefer share could be redeem at a ""par value"" like bonds, while common sharehold might lose everything. Therefore, the par valu repres a good safeti net for retirees, mani of whom like rememb that the global financi crisi wipe out mani major bank stocks.Th trade-off is that prefer share have less upsid potenti than common shares, sinc they becom less attract as they rise abov those par values. Moreover, mani prefer share can be redeemed, mean that Bank of America can buy back those share at par valu at ani time past their redempt dates.Th L-seri prefer stock is an except to that rule. The stock ha a par valu of $1,000, but can't be redeem by Bank of America at ani time. However, Bank of America can convert each L share into 20 common shares, if the common share rise abov 130% of $50 ($65) over 20 of 30 consecut trade days. That probabl won't happen anytim soon, sinc Bank of America wa trade for about $15 as of thi writing.Therefore, the 130% figur indic that each L seri share could eventu be convert into $1,300 worth of stock (20 share of the common stock at $65). So as long as the L seri stock remain below $1,300, as it is now, it trade at a discount to it long-term value, even though it ha an ""uncallable"" par valu of $1,000. Meanwhile, the L seri stock pay quarterli dividend for a 5.9% annual yield --more than tripl the common stock' yield.Growth-ori investor will probabl accept the lower dividend of Bank of America' common share in exchang for higher potenti price growth. However, I believ that the L-seri prefer share are better suit for retirees, becaus they offer more predict price with a much higher yield.Th key takeawayCisco and Bank of America' L seri stock aren't excit invest for growth-ori investors, but they offer stabil and gener incom -- two qualiti which will serv retire well in their golden years. However, investor should also do their due dilig and fulli understand the benefit and drawback of ETFs, cover calls, and prefer stock befor buy ani shares.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.
