Apple, Inc. CEO Tim Cook Talks Up Augmented Reality's Potential (Again);2/10/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has emerged as the next champion of augmented   reality (AR). Despite the company's penchant for secrecy, it's   become increasingly clear that Apple has something in the   pipeline given that CEO Tim Cook keeps talking about AR's   transformative potential. This is that whole ""ship leaking from   the top"" bit that Steve Jobs always referred to.Every few months, Cook weighs in on the debate, either when   asked on an earnings conference call or during a media interview.   While Cook has never been a product visionary type, even by his   own admission, his rationale for why AR has more potential than   virtual reality (VR) makes an awful lot of sense, given Apple's   never-ending pursuit of technologies that have mainstream   appeal.Tim Cook holding the billionth iPhone. Image source:     Apple.makeArticleAd();The most recent interview is withThe Independent, which was published earlier today. Among other topics, Cook   discussed why AR is the way to go.""AR allows individuals to be present in the world""Perhaps the most off-putting aspect of VR for the average   consumer is the fact that users must don a headset to fully   immerse themselves into a virtual world. Even before discussing   the technical requirements or costs associated with a VR headset,   it's fundamentally isolating. In contrast, AR sits on top of the   real world as an overlay without the isolation.I'm excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual     Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be     present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on     what's happening presently. Most people don't want to lock     themselves out from the world for a long period of time and     today you can't do that because you get sick from it. With AR     you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part     of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.Cook continued that he sees the opportunity in AR as analogous   to the smartphone, believing that it can be for ""everyone."" AR   still isn't there quite yet, and needs to improve until its ""good   enough for the mainstream,"" according to the chief executive.How and when?Cook's comments are but the latest in the ongoing debate over   AR's future. In 2016, Cook discussed AR three consecutive months   in a row:The Washington Postin August,ABC Newsin September, andBuzzFeed Newsin October. It's obviously been on his mind quite a bit.At this point, the two most important questions are how Apple   will implement it -- a separate AR headset or integrated into the   iPhone camera system, or both -- and when Apple will officially   release its AR offering. If Apple goes the route of first   integrating AR into the iPhone, which would largely be   software-based, it could reduce the likelihood of leaks. In   contrast, if Apple wants to jump straight to an AR headset, its   supply chain will inevitably leak as prototypes are manufactured   and there will be more physical evidence of its aspirations.Hopefully sooner rather than later, Apple will unveil its next   ""big idea.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

It Can Get Worse for Qualcomm: Legal Blitz Threatens NXP Semiconductor Acquisition;2/10/2017;"It's been a rough start to the year for semiconductor giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) . After putting what many hoped were the worst of   its legal troubles behind it, Qualcomm's shares have plummeted so   far this year, as several new legal entanglements place continued   pressure on the company's patent licensing segment.These legal troubles could negatively affect the chipmaker in   a number of ways. Particularly worrisome, though, is that at   least one analyst has expressed concerns that its courtroom   battles could hamper Qualcomm's pending acquisition ofNXP Semiconductor(NASDAQ: NXPI) .makeArticleAd();QCOMdata byYChartsInside Qualcomm's legal troublesHaving unfolded in several stages around the world, Qualcomm's   five-year legal ordeal can be broken down into five major points.   Each suit has focused on the company's Qualcomm technology   licensing (QTL) segment, which produces roughly two-thirds of the   chipmaker's annual pre-tax profits.In 2013, the Chinese government launched an antitrust   investigation into Qualcomm's patent licensing   practices, which led Qualcomm to pay a $975 million fine to   Chinese regulators early last year. As part of its settlement,   Qualcomm agreed to lower the per-device royalty rates it charges   Chinese mobile-device OEMs. Collecting royalty payments for its   standard-essential 3G and 4G patents, which typically range from   3.25% to 5% of a mobile device's wholesale price before potential   rebate savings, has been a headache for Qualcomm in China. Many   Chinese OEMs either simply didn't pay Qualcomm or allegedly   underreported their royalty payments to the company, so many had   hoped that resolving its Chinese legal issues would represent the   conclusion of Qualcomm's legal woes. As it turns out, those   problems were just the beginning.In late 2015, the EU initiated a similar antitrust   investigation into potential anti-competitive practices by   Qualcomm. The European Commission, the EU's regulatory watchdog,   has yet to reach a verdict against Qualcomm. Many expect the EU   to render its findings, including potential fines, at some point   this year.Then late last year, South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm   $854 million on similar antitrust grounds. Qualcomm is currently   appealing this decision.Finally, Qualcomm was hit with two more blockbuster lawsuits   in late January. Thefirst suitcame from the Federal Trade Commission, claiming that   Qualcomm used its competitive position to gain unfair advantages   in the baseband chip market. Three days later,Apple, one of Qualcomm's largest customers, filed a $1 billion lawsuit   against Qualcomm, alleging that the chipmaker engaged in a number   of anticompetitive tactics. The charges make for someugly reading.Qualcomm is fighting each of its suits and has responded with   some compelling arguments. It doesn't make sense to   speculate about possible verdicts at this point, though some   analysts say the company's mounting legal woes could delay or   even jeopardize its pending NXP Semiconductor acquisition, an   outcome that would damage Qualcomm's long-term growth   trajectory.Image source: QualcommWill the lawsuits affect the NXP buyout?Few analysts seem to believe that Qualcomm's patent licensing   lawsuits alone could compel regulators to block the NXP   acquisition. The important issue here is that Qualcomm's current   products don't compete in the same areas of the semiconductor   market as NXP.However, it appears Qualcomm's growing number of legal   entanglements could slow the merger approval process, especially   in markets such as the EU, where Qualcomm is currently battling   antitrust charges. In fact, one sell-side analyst recently   downgraded Qualcomm shares on the assumption that the NXP deal   will indeed now take longer than expected to close, in which case   NXP's growth will take longer to have a positive impact on   Qualcomm's financial performance.Equally important, extending the time for the deal to close   also increases the odds that an unforeseen event could affect the   acquisition. What if Apple's suit fundamentally alters QTL's   licensing practices? Could that affect Qualcomm's ability to   finance the $39 billion deal? Perhaps. Could Apple's lawsuit   embolden other major customers -- say,Samsung-- to file a similar complaint? If so, what would that   mean? What if another country files yet another antitrust charge   against it?The point is that even a delay leaves the door open for some   other outside factor to come along and derail Qualcomm's critical   NXP purchase. Again, such a scenario appears unlikely. However,   given NXP's place as Qualcomm's entry point to the Internet of   Things market, any potential overhang that could threaten the   deal becomes a must-watch item for its investors.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Gross Margin Was the Star of Apple's Latest Guidance;2/10/2017;"Perhaps the most impressive aspect ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  guidance for the coming quarter was gross   margin, which may increase sequentially despite the loss of   operating leverage. In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior technology   specialist Evan Niu discuss the iPhone maker's outlook for the   current period.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:One of the things that I was happiest about, and I   think maybe this is one of the things that also pushed the   stock up as much as it did after the report,   was, looking forward, management guided that revenue should   come in somewhere between $51.5 billion and $53.5   billion for the next quarter. And this would be a 1.7% to   5.7% increase over where they were a year ago. I think the   reason you have to be really psyched about this as an investor   is, they're showing growth year over year in a quarter that isn't   fiscal Q1, where they are typically doing blockbuster   sales because of the holidays. So, it seems like we are not   only back to growth this quarter, but going to at least   continue moderate growth for the next couple quarters, if   all things hold.Evan Niu:Yeah. And another thing that's pretty   impressive about the guidance for this coming quarter, the   current quarter, is they're also leaving some room for some   gross margin upside, in terms of the guidance. The last   quarter, there was 38.5 [percent], and their current guidance is   38-39 [percent]. What's most impressive about that   is, most of the time, when you're coming off the big   fourth-quarter holiday season, you lose some operating   leverage, so you're margins usually come down slightly because of   the seasonality. For revenue to be coming down from seasonal   factors to this 51.5-53.5 level and still being able to   potentially put up a sequential increase in gross margin,   that's pretty strong. I think the biggest factor that's   contributing to volatility is all the currency stuff.   But, if they could increase gross margin on a sequential   basis after losing leverage, it's pretty good. That's   impressive.Lewis:Yeah. Strong business, firing on all cylinders. Nice   to see them back in a growth phase. Anything else that really   came out to you in the report, Evan?Niu:No. It was just really broad-based. They just hit these   numbers, small little records, but all across the business.   As an investor myself, it's pretty encouraging. There is   this perception that Apple is at the end of the road,   they're running out of ideas, they're peaking. And they're   just like, ""Hey, no, we can still squeeze out these gains if   we really push and hit on all these sides of the business.""Lewis:And that's working with a top-of-the-line   smartphone that really isn't all that different than   the previous versions. I mean, this wasn't a crazy   update to form factor, aside from, maybe, getting rid of the   headphone jack and updating the camera. The phone still resembles   what people expect of the iPhone. So, you think about what   that might mean, were they to make some really serious   updates in functionality, or do something radical   with future versions of the phone. I think you have to   like what that would do for the business.Niu:Yeah. I thought it was the least impressive update in   years. But, here we go.

7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack when I was a kid, a half-century ago, most people saw only three TV networks - CBS, NBC and ABC.makeArticleAd();Source:Flash.pro via Flickr (modified)If you're old enough to remember the DuMont network, please check outmy recent gallery on dividend stocksthat provide solid retirement income. If you think ofTwenty-First Century Fox Inc(NASDAQ:FOXA) as the fourth network, read on.A quarter-century ago, when my children were small, a host of cable networks rose to challenge the broadcast networks for viewers. It was the age of""57 channels and nothing on""with ESPN, the USA Network, CNN, the Weather Channel and the Food Network all having their heyday.Over time, the broadcasters bought out most of the new operators, sometimes after being bought themselves.CBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) now owns Showtime and the Smithsonian Network.Comcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA), the parent of NBC, owns all or part of a dozen networks, including CNBC, Syfy and USA.Walt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), the parent of ABC, owns ESPN, the biggest franchise of all, and the Disney networks. And Fox, which grew up in this era, has clones for nearly all of them.But in the 2010s, a new force has arisen to challenge the network owners, a force they will find difficult to compete with and almost impossible to buy.That force is streaming services, which deliver their shows to your TV, over the internet through plug-in dongles rather than set-top boxes - unless you prefer viewing on a PC, tablet or phone. These offer all the entertainment a TV zombie might ever need, and the services can cost less than $10 per month, much less than a cable service. They don't have schedules, so you watch what you want to watch, when you want to watch it.Streaming through the internet is the future of TV, and we are just at its dawn. It's still unclear how we will discover shows, how we will interface with what we want to watch or how much we'll eventually pay for the privilege of watching. But cable, at least as we knew it, is drifting away, as broadcast television previously drifted away. It will continue to exist, as broadcasting does, just in a smaller, truncated form.What is the future of live events in the new world? Is TV even going to remain a one-way, passive medium? We don't know.In addition to being better, and cheaper, for viewers, the new TV environment right now looks great for entertainers and show producers, who suddenly have a host of new options on where and how to sell their wares, which they're using to gain new creative freedom if not new wealth.But the new media landscape is a lot less stable than the old one and, given the wealth of choices available, it may prove much less lucrative for stars, writers and producers.Just a few years into the new era, moreover, it's apparent that the new streaming companies are big enough to regard the cable networks' owners as minnows. This is not a problem the networks can buy their way out of, as they bought out of cable.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowYour mission, as an investor, is to examine the new TV stocks and decide whether to invest your money in them. And along the way, you will be buying a lot more than TV.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixThe business model of the new TV era was created byNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX).A decade ago, Netflix was a relatively small but interesting company that mailed DVDs. You paid a monthly fee to hold a few, then got more when you sent them back. It was a relatively simple business based on physical media, but it had potential.By simply moving that business model online,using cloud services and open-source technology, Netflix now delivers unlimited amounts of content to viewers as a stream, rather than on a disk.Cofounder Reed Hastings has transformed TV as no one has since Ted Turner. If you bought Netflix when it went public in 2002, your $1 investment is now worth $137.Hasting's second big innovation, which came on the heels of the streaming business model, was tostart funding his own programmingrather than just reselling existing movies and TV shows. His string of hits began withHouse of Cards, based on a British mini-series, which by itself made his monthly $8 per month subscription fee seem a bargain.Netflix offers its shareholders low profit margins, but great growth. Between 2013 and 2016, revenue doubled, from $4.37 billion to $8.83 billion, and profits nearly followed, from 26 cents per share to 43 cents. Along the way, the company has increased its debt dramatically - it now represents about one-fourth of assets - to pay for its delivery infrastructure and to obtain new programming assets, which it is assumed will retain their value over time. (Your grandkids will watchHouse of Cardsthe way your kids now watchM*A*S*H.)With a market cap of $62 billion, Netflix could now buy other TV stocks, like CBS. Its value exceeds that of Fox. ABC and NBC are protected from a Netflix acquisition by deep-pocketed parents, Disney and Comcast. HBO, a subscription service based on cable, will be protected in the same way once parentTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) is bought byAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T).NFLX retains its value as an investment because ofits international operations, which by the fourth quarter of 2016 represented around 40% of the total and continue to grow. In the last three months of 2016 alone the company added 7.05 million new members, after forecasting it would add just 5.2 million. Netflix' growth is accelerating, and its ability to buy must-see programming is growing with it.The problem for Netflix is that the cloud providers on which its success rests have seen what it has done. They're on to the trick. A network today isn't necessarily just a provider of content, but the scaled infrastructure necessary to provide that content. The owners of cloud networks and vast internet networks are copying what Netflix does.These challengers have more zeroes in their asset bases than those NFLX has faced before. Once more, Reed Hastings is a minnow in a sea of sharks.Everything about the industry has changed, but whether Netflix can ride the changes, or whether it will eventually be bought out as Turner was, remains up for debate.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockThereisa price cheaper than Netflix' $8 per month for all-you-can-eat entertainment - the nothing extra I payAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) to access its video as a Prime member.It is true that you can buy Amazon Prime Video, separately,for $8.99 per month. But that's silly since the regular price for Prime, which includes free two-day shipping on most Amazon items, is $99 per year (about $8.25 per month).Lately, Amazon has also been outperforming Netflix on the awards front. In addition to11 Golden Globe nominations this year alone, there are six Oscar nominations forManchester by the Sea(Amazonpaid $10 million for the distribution rightsa year ago).Frankly there is so much free stuff on Amazon (which I can watch on a big screen with my Fire Stick, a wireless dongle that fits on the side of the TV, connects to the internet via WiFi, and supports a host of other services including Netflix) that I don't need anything else. Were it not for live sports, I would kill my cable in a heartbeat, and as my favorite sports signstreaming contracts, that motivation is disappearing as well.And it's not just TV either. I'm fortunate enough to have a wife who hates TV. She reads instead. Amazon's Kindle Unlimited, for another $99 per year, became fantastic over the last year as more authors have signed up and Amazon's algorithms have gotten better at anticipating what people might want to borrow next from its vast library.My son doesn't watch TV either. He's a gamer, and has been for years. He is constantly talking aboutTwitch, which offers live streams of people playing video games. I don't get it, but Amazon does. They paid $970 million for Twitchlast March, making them partners with characters such as Bunnyfufu, who stream their gamingon Twitch.Like most people, I watch very few cable channels. Cancel cable and there is $100-150 per month I can pay for whatever programming I want. There are only so many hours in a day - who needs hundreds of channels with nothing on when a streaming service (or maybe two) can meet my needs?If I sound like an Amazon fanboy, it's because I am. As previously noted, my TV has an Amazon Fire Stick plugged into it, and I use a Fire tablet for reading. I also started accumulating Amazon shares in 2014, at an average price of $330. They're now worth about $800, and they're a bargain at that price.For the fourth quarter of 2016 Amazon earned $749 million, $1.54 per share, on revenues of$43.741 billion. It is making the turn from a company investing in front of growth to one that starts earning profits regularly. Its cloud operation, Amazon Web Services, now brings one-quarter of its $3.5 billion in quarterly revenue to the bottom line - and one of its customers is Netflix.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayImagine. Amazon creates infrastructure that lets other companies make money, then competes with its customers to make even more money with the same infrastructure. I recently dumped shares before earnings, at $832 per share, because they had become such a huge portion of my retirement account.I may have to buy them back.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockNetflix may have created the new business model and Amazon may have perfected it, but the technology began atAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), with Google and YouTube.One of YouTube's co-founders says the idea started afterthe Janet Jackson ""wardobe malfunction""at the 2004 Super Bowl. They just couldn't find any video of it, and so asked others to upload it so they could see it. The service was an immediate sensation, and Google's purchase of the site for $1.65 billion was just the beginning.The business model was simple. People upload videos, people watch videos. Google places ads in front of the videos, and shares some of the revenue with those who uploaded the videos. Like Google itself, it is a free service, although it now has a paid version called YouTube Red.YouTubedid not make a profit for its parentuntil after Amazon and Netflix got going. It is now estimated to be bringing in$10 billion per year, growing at 40% per year, with 80% of views outside the U.S. By 2020 that will mean$27 billionin revenue per year. Its audience is tilted toward young people, aged 18-34, the kind advertisers most covet, and a growing percentage access it via phones or tablets.An analysis from STL Partners indicates YouTube's profit contribution is mainly indirect. Its traffic helps Google get the best prices for internet bandwidth. Its meta data is contributed to other Google services. It gives Google a place at the tablewhenever video copyright issuesare discussed.Veteran TV producer Susanne Daniels joined Google in 2015, and is charged withgrowing the YouTube Red service. She is not onlybuying TV showsand makinga splash at movie festivalsbut aiming to take veteran TV hosts likeConan O'Brien online. (Chelsea Handler has already moved to Netflix.) Daniels is helped by continuing sales ofChromecast, a TV streaming device which competes with the Apple Fire StickYouTube has created its own stars, most of whom are unknown to their parents' generation. The most popular YouTube celebrity, PewDiePie, drew $15 million in income last year and hadalmost 50 million viewers.By taking advantage of Google's low-cost infrastructure, YouTube has carved out a unique niche for itself in the new TV universe, one that is subsidizing its entrance into more ""traditional"" areas like YouTube Red subscriptions.Thanks to Amazon's purchase of Twitch, TV stocks Google and Amazon are now on a collision course in the world of streaming video. Customers of both will be the big winners, but stockholders should do well, too.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Apple (AAPL)Source:via AppleApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) was a latecomer to TV streaming in the cloud.Apple began ramping up spending for its own cloud only a few years ago,investing $15 billion in 2016 aloneto build a global network of cloud data centers and, potentially, a place for itself in the new industry.The money was spent mainly to serve existing paid Apple services, like the sale apps, iCloud storage and iTunes, which are nowbigger profit drivers than the Macintosh or iPad. CEO Tim Cook said in his most recent earnings call that Apple Services brought in$7.17 billionin the December quarter alone, which he expects will double by 2020.Apple's streaming business is distinguished from that of Google because it consists of paid subscribers, and distinguished from Amazon and Netflix by being primarily fee-for-service rather than subscription revenue.While iPhone sales are stagnating, Apple has found a new growth engine in services, and built a platform to challenge the other streaming players. Apple Music now has about21%of the music streaming market,half that of rivalSpotify, but Spotify is not profitable and struggling to justify a $8 billion valuation, which at One Infinite Loop is considered seat cushion money.Apple's push into TV streaming will be through a new app called, simply,TV, which aims to solve one of the most vexing problems for a streaming user - deciding what to watch next. The Apple TV streaming service itself has yet to launch, butrumors about it abound. Apple wants to get the same 30% revenue cut on TV streaming it gets on apps, producing a service that will cost $20-30 per month.The most persistent rumors about Apple's intent regarding streaming involveHBO Now, a Time Warner service that costs $15 per month, and which was Apple exclusive for a few months in 2015. Apple has the financial wherewithal to buy HBO as part of Time Warner's merger with AT&T, or to buy a broadcasting company like CBS for cash. Apple TV hardware isused by an estimated 11.9%of TV streaming customers.Thanks to its existing service businesses, global reach and over $200 billion in cash, Apple has the freedom to be patient and negotiate with rights holders before launching a TV streaming service. But it is far more concerned with maintaining its high margins than with driving traffic, which hurts it in competition with services whose prices start at virtually free, like Google's YouTube and Amazon Prime.It is hard for me to see how Apple can win in streaming when it's unwilling to bend on margins to win market share, and willing to dither aimlessly with existing TV rights holders while rivals are creating their own shows and even new types of experiences.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendBut that's just my opinion. I bought Apple shares before its 7:1 split in 2014, sold about half, but retain them in my retirement account. It's going to be a nice retirement.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: AT&T (T)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrI got my first glimpse of the future several years ago, when rights to English Premier League games came up for bids.The winners weren't the traditional networks, public or private. They wereSky TV, a direct broadcast satellite company, andBritish Telecom, the state phone company.This was years before AT&T said it would buy Time Warnerfor a reported $85.4 billion. It was even years before AT&T agreed to spend$48.5 billion forDirecTV, the direct broadcast satellite business.The two deals will combine to transform AT&T from a phone company into a streaming player. It will be able to bundle wireless, satellite and internet subscriptions, and let its customers stream shows from DirecTV to their mobile deviceswithout cost.Its new streaming service, DirecTV Now, carried an introductory price of $35 per month for 60 channels and attractedover 200,000 customers during the fourth quarterwhich helped offset a loss of customers from its more traditional cable service, U-Verse. It competes ina cord-cutting nichealongsideSling TV, owned by DirecTV rivalDISH Network Corp(NASDAQ:DISH), and Playstation Vue, owned bySony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE)For the fourth quarter, AT&T reported net income of $2.44 billion, 39 cents per share, on revenue of $41.84 billion. While this didn't clear the company's 49-cent-per-share dividend payment during the quarter, for the year the company did earn $2.10 per share, beating the $1.93 annual dividend. It's the dividend, a 4.7% yield to today's stock buyer, that you're buying when you buy AT&T stock. The shares themselves are worth little more than they were in 2007.I switched from Comcast to AT&T for my own TV and internet service last year, combining it with my existing mobile phone subscription. I now pay the company about $400 per month for various services. That's a lot of cash flow. I should probably buy the stock.AT&T is the most traditional of the new streaming players. It earns a place in this gallery for its sheer size, with annual revenue of $164 billion, and its control of key internet infrastructure in the core of the network and at the edge.AT&T has moved into streaming for defensive reasons. Internet advocates have criticized it for DirecTV Now, which gives its own customers free bits that others are charged for, ignoring the concept of network neutrality, but the Donald Trump Administration isgiving it a free pass on that.When the acquisition of Time Warner is finalized - and that looks like a better bet with Trump in charge - AT&T will own a big hunk of the traditional cable universe, including HBO, CNN and Cartoon Network.Time Warner agreed to be bought, in part, because it needs cash to compete for programming against deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix, Amazon, Google and possibly Apple. AT&T bought Time Warner because the vertical integration - owning the programming as well as the network so you write rights checks to yourself - should allow it to maintain that dividend.Comcast made the marriage of network infrastructure and content work with NBC Universal, mainly by keeping its hands off its creative people. It is still unclear to me whether AT&T will be willing to do the same, or whether it will focus on milking a dying industry for profits, which has been its way of doing business since I began covering them over three decades ago.That's the only thing keeping me from buying the shares. That and the lack of capital gains.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Facebook (FB)Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is the newest and, based on revenue, the second-smallest of the new streaming players, behind only Netflix.During the December quarter Facebookearned $1.41 per shareon $8.81 billion in revenue. This makes it four times bigger than Netflix by revenue. With a market cap of about $390 billion, it isthe sixth most valuable company in the country, less than five years after first going public.Facebook got into streaming withFacebook Live, a sort of YouTube for streaming, which has already made news with House Democrats streaming a sit-in when Republicans turned off their cameras and with Donald Trump announcing a Supreme Court pick on the service.Facebook Live is already getting Facebook into trouble with rights holders, like the TV network which saw sales of a recent pay-per-view fight in Australia impacted when one subscribersimply held his phone up to his TV and streamed it. There is even a name for this kind of thing -""stream ripping.""Facebook is reportedlyworking on an app for streaming, which would put it into more direct competition with Apple TV and Google's YouTube. This would be a software solution that lets it piggyback on others' hardware, like Chromecast, Amazon's Fire Stick and Apple TV. In addition to supporting its streaming, the app would also support 10-minute TV shows with commercials inserted into them,like broadcast TV in the 1940s.What makes Facebook powerful in streaming is the sheer number of people using the service - nearly 2 billion - and the amount of time they spend with it. The average global user spends 20 minutes per day on the service, andthe average American spends twice that amount of time.Analysts are divided on analogiesfor Facebook's strategy here. Is it Netflix? Is it YouTube?In fact, neither analogy is correct. Facebook mainly wants to integrate video into its existing offering. It is backing away frompaying publishers for streams, and may be backing away in the near term as people use its unmoderated do-it-yourself streaming to show themselvescommitting violent crimesandeven committing suicide.All this reminds me of something I wrote 20 years ago, about telephony. Telephony is simply an internet service. Today, video is the same, an internet service. The difference is that video is far more intimate than a phone call, easier to make money from and subject to discussion of rights, or right and wrong.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenIntegrating video, even streaming video, as just one part of a broader computer experience is the road not being taken by anyone but Facebook.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Alibaba (BABA)Source: ShutterstockAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) got into streaming in 2015 by buyingYouku Tudou, a Chinese version of YouTube,for $4 billion-plus.Alibaba was late to this business, but is working hard to make up for lost time. It launched a paid streaming service calledTmall Box Officein September, 2015. It has a TV operating systemcalled YunOS, which is getting its streaming services into homes throughout East and South Asia.In 2016, Alibaba launchedpartnerships with a host of global producers, the most important being with Steven Spielberg'sAmblin Entertainment, which is aiming to bring Chinese stories to American audiences and vice versa. Alibaba also took a stakein China'sHeHe Picturesand signed a deal withHarry Potterproducer David Heyman to produce a series of movies aroundWarriors,a children's book series about warring cats. Already in 2017 Alibaba has signed to becomea major sponsor of the Olympic Games, responsible for streaming events and back-end cloud computing.Thanks to deals like this, Alibaba's digital media revenues grew 270% year-over-year, inits most recent quarterly report.The segment produced $585 million in revenue.Despite all this, Alibaba is still a relative minnow in the streaming TV stocks waters. Its streaming revenue is just one-quarter that of Netflix. What makes it powerful, and a threat to the giants, is its strength throughout Asia, not just in China; its willingness to buy its way into businesses like movie production; and its highly profitable growth trajectory, which gives it a cash hoard worth $15 billion, which it is far more aggressive about investing than Apple.Because Alibaba enables commerce, rather than buying inventory as Amazon does, it brings over 25% of its revenue to the net income line, with operating cash flow that has grown four-fold in the last four years. It has enormous advantages in China, the world's second-largest and one of its fastest-growing markets. This has given it a springboard into other markets like India, Indonesia and Thailand, where it is also growing a range of services.It is just a matter of time before Alibaba becomes a major factor in the U.S. market, through its ownership of content and cloud operations if nothing else. Any innovation a U.S. company can come up with, moreover, can be jumped on by Alibaba in a flash, grown in China as a captive market, and then sprung on the world quickly.It may be the most important story of the next four years, but it won't be televised. It will definitely be streamed. I'm a buyer.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novellaInto the Cloud, available at the Amazon Kindle store.

7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDividend stocks are a great choice for achieving the retirement you deserve. Yet there is perhaps no concept in the cultural lexicon that has been more perverted in recent years than the concept ""deserve.""makeArticleAd();Source:Mike via Flickr (Modified)In America today, many people think they deserve a decent job, good health, safety and security … just by the accident of their existence. Children and young adults are taught they deserve a trophy for participating in sports, and that they deserve good grades in school just for showing up.Call me old school, but I think the only thing one deserves in life is what one earns. That's true of a job, healthcare, safety, recognition, grades or anything else that is a value one mustactupon to gain and/or keep. It's also true when it comes to your retirement.You see, you don'tdeservewell-funded golden years unless you take action to earn it.Fortunately, acting now to ensure a deserving retirement isn't really difficult to know how to do. It is, however, actually hard to do.Let's face it: Deferring the short-term gratification that comes from spending money on today's needs, wants and luxury indulgences requires an uncomfortable exercise in self-restraint. Yet mustering the fortitude to think long-term is usually what's required if you want that well-funded retirement you think you deserve.While I can only help you with the self-restraint aspect of this task by identifying the reality of this requirement, I can help you much more by identifying some of the best dividend stocks to buy that will help provide you the financial fertilizer by which you can grow those deserving golden years.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayHere are seven dividend stocks to buy for the retirement you deserve.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: General Motors (GM)Source: ShutterstockGM Dividend Yield:4.3%General Motors Company(NYSE:GM), or ""Government Motors,"" has finally escaped the fiscal speed bump it hit during the Great Recession. Now the company is firing in all cylinders, selling vehicles to U.S. and international consumers at a record pace.GM cleared the 10 million mark for vehicles soldfor the first time ever in 2016. That's thanks to successes in China, where the automaker sold an all-time best 3.87 million vehicles - a 7.1% improvement from the previous year.Although the short- and intermediate-term fate of GM stock will rev and stall based on monthly sales figures and quarterly reports, there is no denying that this behemoth is here to stay for the long haul. As long as the world needs transportation via cars and light trucks, GM is likely to be there to sell them. We know this because despite the government bailout in December 2008, the company is back and better than ever before.That's the power of a stalwart brand - and one that U.S. government won't let go down under any circumstances.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source:Dawn Via FlickrJNJ Dividend Yield:2.8%When selecting dividend stocks for the retirement you deserve, concentrate on consumer non-discretionary companies making things we all can't do without.I suspect that healthcare products giantJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) is in your medicine cabinet right now. The iconic and ultra-diversified consumer, pharmaceutical and medical device maker is famous for shampoo, skin lotion, baby oil, wound care and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines.And that's just the consumer segment.The company's medical devices are used in orthopedic surgical care, cardiovascular care, diagnostics and vision treatments. Yet it's the success of its pharmaceutical division that vaults JNJ on to our list of dividend stocks. The company's treatments for chronic and ever-growing afflictions such as rheumatoid arthritis, prostate cancer and diabetes give it the financial heft needed to be a long-term retirement hold.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryAnd acquisitions like its$30 billion buyout of biopharma outfitActelionwill keep JNJ ahead of the game.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Apple (AAPL)Source: Carved.comAAPL Dividend Yield:1.7%Personal technology giantApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a profit machine, and after years of building up billions in cash on its balance sheet, the Cupertino behemoth decided to give some of that cash back to shareholders.While AAPL's yield is on the lower end of this list of deserving dividend stocks to buy, that shouldn't dissuade you from putting it on your list.You see, part of a deserving retirement requires some of your stocks to also deliver outsize share price appreciation. In that department, AAPL tastes sweet. Over the past 10 years, the stock is up more than 1,000%. And while the odds of another 1,000% gain over the next 10 years are low, I suspect a decade from now, those who own AAPL today will be flashing triple-digit-percentage-gain smiles.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: AT&T (T)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrT Dividend Yield:4.7%Classic widow-and-orphan stockAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) is just one of those telecom dividend stock giants perfectly tailored for delivering that deserved retirement. The company's massive 100% fiber network delivers wireless and TV services across the country, and the revenues it generates from these services is reason alone to own the stock.Yet the company also is very inventive (it holds more than 20,000 patents), and it has demonstrated business savvy in its merger deals withDirecTV, and soon (if the government doesn't block it) withTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). AT&T says it's on pace toclose the merger by year's end.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatDividend-wise, T is in elite status, havingraised its payout for the past 33 yearswhile also offering one of the highest yields in theS&P 500.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Disney (DIS)Source:Richard Stephenson via Flickr (Modified)DIS Dividend Yield:1.4%If you're reading this, I can make one obvious assumption about you, and that is you're sentient in the year 2017. That's enough information for me to know that you also know whatWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) is, and what it does.The purveyors of iconic American characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Snow White know what the world wants to see, and has built a media and entertainment empire that now includes characters such as Captain America, BB-8 and Merida.The company, founded on the genius of Walt Disney the man, was set up to be a dream factory capable of igniting children's imaginations all over the world. It's safe to say that it has done just that.DIS the stock also has ignited investors' portfolios. Over the past decade, shares are up nearly 220% while also paying a solid (though admittedly not spectacular) dividend yield of 1.4%. But like AAPL, Disney is one of those dividend stocks likely to keep delivering the sort of outsize total returns that can provide you the retirement you deserve.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Merck (MRK)Source:Ryan via Wikimedia (Modified)MRK Dividend Yield:2.9%Drug giantMerck & Co., Inc.(NYSE:MRK) is similar to JNJ in that it makes products that people can't do without. Although in Merck's case, many of its products literally keep people alive (e.g., its top-selling treatment, the diabetes pill Januvia).The company's diverse lineup of high-margin drugs will keep delivering strong revenue and strong profits for years to come. Moreover, its pipeline of new drugs also should keep its top and bottom lines healthy enough to deliver strong returns on invested capital over the long-term.Although the company has faced robust competition from branded drugs going off-patent in recent years, industry analysts tell me the company has gotten past the worst of the off-patent losses. My research also indicates recent R&D is on the upswing, which means even more high-margin drugs in the years to come.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThat means good fiscal therapy for that deserved retirement.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Goldman Sachs (GS)Source:Erik DrostGS Dividend Yield:2.6%If you were asked to name the first Wall Street investment bank that comes to mind, I suspect that name would beGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS). The company has financed America's growth since 1869, racking up a storied history of providing the capital, as well as the financial framework, that's nurtured the rise of American capitalism.By recruiting and hiring some of the smartest, most business-savvy people on earth to carry on the company's stellar tradition, Goldman Sachs has managed to deliver big for investors even through the dark days of the Great Depression and the Great Recession. And while GS isn't the biggest yielder among financial dividend stocks, its decent 2.6% yield has helped smooth out a few rough periods.It's no coincidence that many former Goldman Sachs employees rise to positions of power in government after stints at the premier investment house. The company and its personnel have earned their immense influence world … and that influence translates directly to deserving investor bottom lines.As of this writing, Jim Woods was long AAPL and GS.The post7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserveappeared first onInvestorPlace."
The Next iPhone Wants to Look Into Your Eyes;2/10/2017;"Expectations for the 2017 iPhone are running high, given the   fact that it will be the 10th-generation ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) most important product. As always, a steady   stream of supply-chain leaks are stoking speculation as to what   features the Mac maker may or may not include. The most expensive   feature-packed model may even set customers backover $1,000. Today's rumor comes from the notoriously hit-or-missDigiTimes, which says that in addition to an OLED display and wireless   charging, the device will also include iris-scanning   technology.A boulder of saltAs always, investors should treat any and all iPhone rumors   with a healthy bit of skepticism. That's especially true since   we've heard similar reports before. Apple first started exploring   iris-scanning technology back in 2014, andDigiTimessaid in July 2016 that the iris-scanning feature wouldn't be   included until the 2018 iPhone. A month later, the same outlet   said 2017 would be the year Apple would debut the technology   after placing orders for iris-recognition chips with Taiwan-based   Xintec.Separately, there are conflicting reports that Apple may   instead prefer to use some type of facial recognition system, as   Apple has filed numerous patents around bio-recognition   methods.makeArticleAd();Biometrics are all the rage right nowIt makes sense that Apple is exploring iris-recognition   technology; what's less clear is the timing of when Apple will   pull the trigger. Iris recognition would be a strong complement   to Touch ID, adding another layer of biometric security. Iris   scanning is even more secure than fingerprint scanning since it's   harder to fake. You may remember when researchers cracked Touch   ID shortly after the feature's launch in 2013, although it still   stands that Touch ID is still vastly superior to alpha-numeric   passwords.Imagine Apple Pay using iris recognition. Image source:     Apple.Beyond logging in, it's also easy to imagine how Apple may   wish to add another layer of biometric security to Apple Pay,   making the company's mobile payment service even more secure.Everybody's doing itThis is an area rivals have already been exploring.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) included an iris scanner and Windows Hello,   Microsoft's biometric login functionality, in 2015's Lumia 950   and 950 XL. The software giant has yet to bring iris recognition   to other Windows Hello-enabled devices, although many Windows 10   PCs can use facial recognition technology.Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 from last year also included an iris scanner,   which in addition to its propensity to spontaneously combust was   a differentiating feature from Samsung's other flagship devices   from 2016 like the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge. While the South Korean   company's initial efforts to popularize iris-scanning technology   went down in literal flames, the forthcoming Galaxy S8 is   expected to feature an iris scanner. Samsung also launches its   Galaxy flagships in the spring, and the S8 is expected to be   unveiled in March ahead of an April launch.Apple cares little about being the first -- it just wants to   be the best. If it can implement iris scanning in a more seamless   and integrated way than rivals, it could accelerate the   popularization of biometric security better than anyone else.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This 50% Dividend Grower Is Hiding in Plain Sight;2/10/2017;"There are two ways to get big dividends: you can buy stocks that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stocks that consistently grow their payouts.A well-balanced portfolio will include both types of companies, withdividend-growth stocksbeing the cornerstone of a longer-term income strategy.Still, investors sometimes get frustrated with dividend growers because to get their outsized payout growth, you often have to settle for a low current yield. And why buy a risky asset that yields 1% when you can get a long-term Treasury that pays 2%?makeArticleAd();There are two answers to this question. The first is that Treasuries aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rates go up, the value of your Treasury will go down. If you need to sell early for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stocks will increase their income over time - something Treasuries will never do. In fact, if you choose thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your income skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world's most recognizable and popular brands:Apple (AAPL).If you read about investing in Apple, you almost always see a focus on iPhone sales, the value of future products and so on. Bears note slowing iPhone sales growth (or negative sales growth), devices that didn't quite catch on and rising competition. Bulls counter that Apple has a valuable and unique market position and innovative products that captivate consumers.Both arguments are really missing the point.The main reason to buy Apple is more boring but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let's start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, meaning Apple's dividend-payout ratio is a measly 24%. But the really amazing thing is how the company's cash flow has exploded and continues to rise:FCF Boots UpYes, there's been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF has already bottomed out and is now back on the rise.The next thing to consider is Apple's operating margin, which is currently 27%. This is important because it means the company is so profitable that it can continue to pay out dividends at the current payout rate. That operating margin has fallen slightly in recent years, partly as a result of changes in the smartphone market, but it's still historically high:Apple Remains a Profit MonsterNote that we've seen Apple's profit margin remain over 25% since 2009. This is great news for investors, but it also means Apple has become a very different company than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. It's no longer a burgeoning tech firm but an enterprise that reliably and consistently produces cash it can distribute to shareholders. In other words, it's a blue chip stock, not a speculative bet.Again, great news for investors - especially those looking for income. Ironically, many dividend-growth investors forget about Apple, or they may allocate a very small part of their portfolios to the company out of fear that it's risky. That's a mistake.In the last five years since Apple started paying dividends, its payout has soared 50.6%:Strong Dividend GrowthIf we compare that to some of the most popular and supposedly ""safer"" dividend payers, we see that Apple's dividend growth is a big outperformer:Apple Trounces the RestAs you can see,General Electric (GE), AT&T (T), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Chevron (CVX), Consolidated Edison (ED)andExxon Mobil (XOM)are all growing their dividends at a slower pace than Apple.The tech giant also has a lower P/E ratio than all of these names (just 15.6, which is 39% lower than the rest of the S&P 500).It's time to think different about Apple; this is a relatively safe dividend stock that is destined to be a Dividend Aristocrat. While headlines about iPhone sales may cause some volatility in the short term, the company's strong cash generation will reward you with big payouts in the long run.7 More Buys for 100%+ GainsApple isn't the only cheap dividend grower out there - there are plenty more (yes, even in a market that's trading at a nosebleed 24 times earnings!).In fact, we're cashing in on 7 other stocks hiking their payoutseven fasterthan Apple: I'm talkingreliable yearly dividend hikes of 20%+!These 7 low-key stocks are where you need to be with the Trump bump sputtering and the Fed sending mixed signals on interest rates.

4 Technology Stocks Well Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates;2/10/2017;"The fourth-quarter earnings season has been reasonably well for 13 out of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, with overall earnings up +5.8% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. As per the latest ZacksEarnings Outlook, this growth rate is much better than +2.8% earnings growth on +2.0% revenue growth for this same group of companies in the third quarter.makeArticleAd();Notably, 319 S&P 500 members (76.3% of the index's total membership) have already reported their results. Of this, 69.6% stocks have beat earnings estimates and 54.5% have come ahead of revenue expectations. However, positive surprises are tracking below the 75.5% and 58.9% earnings and revenue beat percentages for this same group of companies in the preceding quarter, respectively.Overall, earnings are now anticipated to grow +7.3% on +3.9% higher revenues on a year-over-year basis. The anticipated figures mark a solid improvement over the third quarter earnings growth of 3.7% on the back of 2.2% higher revenues. Moreover, the earnings growth figure is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2014.Technology: A Standout Sector in Q4Technology has been one of the standout sectors in the fourth quarter. Almost 86.1% of the sector's total market capitalization has already reported. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.8% from the same period last year on +6.0% higher revenues, with 70.5% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.The strong growth reflected solid performance from industry giants like Intel Corp,Microsoft(MSFT) andAlphabet(GOOGL). Contrary to the third quarter,Apple's(AAPL) big earnings beat also helped results this time.The rapid adoption of cloud was the common growth factor for these companies. Additionally, growing acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT) drove overall results.We believe the rapid adoption of cloud-based technologies will be the key catalyst going ahead. Per IDC, IT spending on cloud infrastructure - servers, enterprise storage, and Ethernet switches for the enterprise private cloud and co-location services - will increase 18.2% in 2017 to $44.2 billion. The growth rate is particularly noticeable when compared with spending on traditional IT, which is expected to decline 3.3% in 2017.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you. You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positiveEarnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Our ChoicesGiven below are four technology providers that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Optoelectronics Inc.(AAOI) - Sugar Land, TX-based Applied Optoelectronics designs, develops and manufactures advanced optical devices, packaged optical components, optical subsystems, laser transmitters and fiber optic transceivers.We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 106.74%.The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Feb 23. Currently, Applied Optoelectronics has an Earnings ESP of +15.87% and carries a Zacks Rank #1.

Moreover, expansion in strategic relationships with the likes of Telefonica is positive in our view. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 21.33%.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.56%. The company is set to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Feb 22.GoDaddy Inc.

How Apple Inc. Hopes to Grow Its Services Business to $50 Billion by 2020;2/10/2017;"Services continue to be an increasingly important segment forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in part due to the recurring nature of the   revenue it produces. In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, the cast discusses how Apple plans to double the size of this   business over the next four years.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:One of the segments that is gaining more and   more attention from analysts and the market in general   is Apple's services segment. This is the iTunes Store, the   App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music, TV App Store, etc. Services,   this time, came in at $7.2 billion, which is roughly 9% of   revenue. But, perhaps more impressively, it was up 18% year   over year. It seems like the company and the Street are both   giving this a little bit more emphasis as time goes on.Evan Niu:Yeah. And that was a quarterly record, one of   those records they set this quarter. If you look at it   now on a trailing 12-month basis, services has now crossed   $25 billion, in terms of the size of the business. So this   is a huge business already. Here's the crazy thing:   They're very ambitiously saying they're hoping to double the   services business within four years. That's saying,   ""We think we can make this a $50 billion business by   2020."" Which is pretty ambitious. As far as how they'll get   there, they highlighted a couple things. First of all, now,   there are 150 million paid subscriptions that are   being automatically billed, recurring subscriptions.   That includes Apple's services as well as third-party services.   But that's the total number that is being billed through   iTunes and the App Store right now. That's a pretty big number.   They do expect that to keep growing. That's a pretty big base of   regular subscriptions of various types of services that they   sell. Transaction volumes are going up, the installed base   is growing. There's really all these different aspects of it.   They even mentioned -- this is kind of surprising -- the   iCloud storage business is growing quite a bit. I would   never have thought it would be a growth driver.   But, basically, all these different aspects are really   putting up good growth, and combined, they're really bullish   about this going forward. It's a pretty ambitious goal there.Lewis:Yeah. Looking at the inputs of what makes up that   services revenue, there's momentum on both sides. Not only   is the installed base is getting larger -- so,   the number of people that are actually somehow   transacting with the services segment -- they indicated   in the call that that's increasing in the strong double   digits. Also, the ARPU (average revenue per user) for each paying   customer is increasing in the double digits. So it's not   that one side of that equation is really crushing it and the   other one is stagnating. Both sides are performing well. And I   think that's what you want to see.Niu:Yeah. And they also had mentioned the music   business, which had been declining for quite some time,   for many years. Before Apple got into the streaming   side, when it was all the download business for music, as   people shifted toward streaming, that business was shrinking.   Now, we're back to this inflection point where music is   growing again. If you include both download and streaming -- so   both iTunes plus Apple Music -- if you combine   them, the music business as a whole is now growing again.   That's always nice to see, particularly as the shift   toward streaming continues, more and more people   are willing to pay. The industry itself really likes   the shift to paid streaming versus ad-supported streaming.   And Apple is a big proponent in that transition. That's also   another good sign. They are really helping the music   industry grow as a whole, as well as their cut of the whole   music business growing again.Lewis:And you have to like that, considering that they   are, what some people might argue, kind of a late   entrant into streaming music. You already   had Spotify with tens of millions of people using   it, and you might have wondered what adoption might have   looked like for Apple Music and the streaming service.   But results seem to be pretty good so far.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and     recommends Apple.

Could Snap Inc. (SNAP) Make Its Own iPhone Killer?;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) isn't yet a publicly traded company. But in the runup to the Snapchat IPO, the social media company is making big plans for the future.makeArticleAd();That involves hardware that seems to include a smartphone designed to compete withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and its flagship iPhone.Snapchat parent Snap Inc. has already made a move into hardware with Spectacles, a cleverly named set of smart glasses that are designed to work with its social media app. You cancheck out a demoof Spectacles here on the company's YouTube channel.But that could only be the beginning. Many experts have recently speculated that Snapchat will be developing its own phone soon to coincide with the IPO of SNAP stock. After all, the core of the business is certainly under pressure lately afterFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) releasedInstagram Storiesin 2016 as a self-described imitation of Snapchat's already successful platform and siphoned users away.Click to EnlargeCheck out this infographic from marketing firmMediakixfor a glimpse at what a Snap Inc. smartphone might look like.There are a lot of questions about Snap Inc. as the company approaches IPO, not the least of which is how it can continue to innovate and grow users as well as how profitable it can be.But as InvestorPlace IPO expert Tom Taulli pointed out recently, Snapchat describes itself on its home page asa camera company. And that means hardware is a key part of the mission.Spectacles may only be the beginning, then.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Targeting a Triple-Digit Return;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a good, but volatile, ride forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders in 2017. Now supports are once again firming up both off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock. And for shorter-term investors, a bullishly targeted butterfly is one way to position and capture a nice profit range with limited risk in lieu of owning shares of Alphabet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhen it comes to large-cap tech outfits like Alphabet,political risksranging from China to net neutrality to immigration laws remain a question mark. But waiting on a resolution is like waiting on Godot.It may take a while. As well, those eventual outcomes could always prove beneficial to GOOGL.Of course, there are also the potential political supports, such as cash repatriation and favorable corporate tax cuts, to consider. Not only is passage of such legislation more popular and likely easier to push through Congress, it would certainly be a boon for Alphabet.What's more, GOOGL stock is looking great again after its recent earnings report. Bottom line,earnings missed but growth is back.With its Q4 results, Alphabet proved its business focuses outside the company's bread-and-butter advertising search revenues, are starting to pay-off for the company.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayFor one, mobile search and YouTube both showed strong results and helped with Alphabet's overall ""exceptional"" year-over-year sales growth of 24%.But newer investments are also coming into their own. The company's aggressive shift into hardware such as its Pixel smartphone,AI-enhanced Homeand virtual reality helped Alphabet grow its ""other revenues"" by more than 62% on sales of $3.4 billion.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartAway from Alphabet's overall bullish narrative off the price chart, GOOGL stock is showing technical support for a long stake by investors.Following a fairly stiff post-earnings bout of profit-taking from brief all-time-highs, Alphabet has managed to find support from a Fibonacci zone, key price pivot dating back to last February's high, as well as the intermediate-term, 50-day simple moving average.Looking forward, targeting the post-earnings high of $867 appears logical. At roughly 4% from current prices, but with no overt company-specific catalysts on the immediate horizon to push GOOGL shares aggressively higher, I like the idea of using a targeted long butterfly spread.GOOGL Stock Bullish Call Butterfly SpreadTiming is everything. This is especially true with options strategies as calls and puts are wasting assets. Ourlast discussion on Alphabet optionsis intimately aware of this, as a lower-risk, bullishly placed long butterfly literally expired one day and $1 dollar short of cleaning up.I suppose you could say the last trade got trumped.Nevertheless, in looking at Alphabet's options and given what has been addressed, the GOOGL March $845/$860/$875 is attractive.Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This TradeWith GOOGL trading at $833, the out-of-the-money and bullishly placed butterfly is priced for $2.20 per spread, or less than one-third of one percent of the GOOGL stock price. A maximum profit of $12.80 or return approaching 600% would occur if GOOGL rallied by 3.25% over the next month and landed on the sold center strike $860 call at expiration.The desired and very precise outcome for maximizing returns is not a high-probability event by any stretch. However, with its limited risk, profit range from roughly $847 to $873 and maybe the use of a 50% stop loss in the event profit-taking turns into something more ominous, a GOOGL stock butterfly looks well positioned for the situation.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This Trade;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder a month ago, I wrote about howit wasn't too late to create free profitsfromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. The trade yielded almost $5 in pure profits. I gained $3 from my debit call spread appreciation and $2 from selling the naked put.makeArticleAd();Now Apple stock sits near its all-time highs making it difficult to recommend an entry point. Furthermore, other mega-caps likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) have more obvious entry points.So is it too late to set another long trade in AAPL? I don't think so; there is still time to set another trade using options for another potential run of free profits.Fundamentally, Apple stock still is a money printing machine with a rosy intermediate outlook. I have my concerns about its leadership though; I strongly believe that Tim Cook will ruin Apple, but not in the next few months. Meanwhile, and if markets in general don't suffer a sustained correction this year, AAPL should be higher through 2017.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsClick to EnlargeTechnically, AAPL has a few constructive points. First, it made a wide rounding bottom rejecting the last swoon.Also, I think that if Apple stock sets a new high it would invite more frantic buyers who were leery of the potential of another double top.The Trade:Buy the AAPL April debit $135/$140 call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.40 per contract to open. If Apple rallies well past my spread, I stand to triple my money. The price I pay to open the trade is the maximum I could lose. Usually I like to lower my exposure. In this case, I want to sell downside risk premium to finance the purchase of my calls or more. It's difficult to do so near all-time-high levels, but not impossible.The Bank:Sell the AAPL Jan 2018 $105 put. This also is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract to open. By selling naked puts I am committing to buying the stock at the strike sold if Apple stock falls below it. But even if that bad scenario unfolds, I would have bought the stock at a 20% discount from today's levels. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success.As long as AAPL stock stays above my put sold, any premium I collect from selling my debit call spread can be pure profit. So if price action becomes too bearish, I could sell back the debit call spread for a profit even if the price I get is lower than my entry price.Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL)I am not required to hold my trades through their expiration dates.

Nvidia Shows Artificial Intelligence Revolution Is Biggest Trend Of Our Time;2/10/2017;"Nvidia (Shutterstock photo)It's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining more than 370%. But while the company's graphics processor unit (GPU) chips are being used in everything from gaming PCs to autonomous cars to virtual reality to data centers, the reinvigoration of Nvidia is built by one thing: artificial intelligence.AI is increasingly being used in everything and everywhere, most notably data centers for machine learning, where Nvidia's GPUs have a tremendous lead over the competition, including anything from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenue was up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impressive fiscal third-quarter 2017 results that helped send the stock soaring more than 30% in November 2016.makeArticleAd();The technology is touching everything and anyone, be it on your smartphone or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or using software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang toldBarron'sthat AI is just the future of software.If you read Nvidia's conference call transcript and itsearnings press release, AI is mentioned everywhere and with good reason: deep learning is only made possible by the advancements in AI being made by university researchers and big companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.In reacting to the blow-out earnings results, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis called Nvidia essentially the only publicly traded company solely focused on AI. ""[Nvidia] posted its 7th consecutive beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% likely marks 2nd derivative peak, the 200% growth in its Datacenter business and improving GM reinforce our thesis that NVDA is emerging as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most exciting growth drivers in tech,"" Lipacis wrote, while raising his price target to $140 from $125.Of the aforementioned areas, perhaps the one that is most tangible to show consumers the AI revolution is autonomous driving.Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneered autonomous driving in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla has chosen to use Nvidia's chipsets to not only help it with its infotainment unit, but more importantly, the software that helps withautonomy, using the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform.Society is a little bit away from true autonomy in a car (Level 5), in which a human does not need to do anything, but Tesla is working on getting towards Level 4/5 faster than anyone else, thanks to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, clickhere.)Nvidia has several other automotive partnerships, including recently announced ones with Bosch andAudi.All of this highlights that self-driving cars is not just a science fiction fantasy, it's real and it's coming. And it's being powered by AI. The societal impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, but there is no stopping it.AI is continuing to become more prevalent in everything we do, but we are nowhere near general AI, in which computers can make decisions just as a human can. What we're experiencing right now is soft (weak) AI, in which humans tell a computer to do a task and it does it better than any human can. But thanks to deep/machine learning, we're getting closer to general AI, even if it's still decades away. That means the AI revolution is only just getting started and it has years and years on which to run.All thanks to Nvidia."
Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions, Inc. vs. Qualcomm;2/10/2017;"Though investing is filled with uncertainty, occasionally, the   answer to a certain question is as clear as day. Today, that   seems to be the case in comparing semiconductor companiesSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , as the recent movements of their stock prices   suggest.QCOMdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Clearly, the market had voted in favor of Skyworks' stock over   that of Qualcomm lately, but is that trend likely to continue? In   this article, we'll run Skyworks Solutions and Qualcomm through a   three-part analysis to better understand which company's stock is   the better buy today.Qualcomm vs. Skyworks: Financial fortitudeComparing the solvency and liquidity metrics for Qualcomm and   Skyworks, the two chip companies are both in fine financial   shape, as you can see from the following chart.CompanyCash & InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioQualcomm$29.7 billion$11.6 billion$6.0 billion2.0Skyworks Solutions$1.1 billion$0$1.2 billion7.2Data sources: Qualcomm and Skyworks investor relations.In terms of their near-term liquidity, Qualcomm and Skyworks   each carry far more current assets than current liabilities,   although Skyworks' deserves special praise for its particularly   conservative quick ratio. Neither company appears to present much   in the way of liquidity risk. Furthermore, Qualcomm and Skyworks   Solutions both employ conservative capital structures. Qualcomm   can easily service its outstanding obligations from either its   current cash balance or its operating cash flows. Here too,   though, Skyworks wins since it eschews borrowing altogether and   still generates plenty of cash.It also briefly deserves noting that Qualcomm's balance sheet   composition will certainly change when its pending acquisition of   Internet of Things (IoT) chipmakerNXP Semiconductorcloses at some point this year. Qualcomm will finance the deal   using its overseas cash reserves and by issuing bonds. Though   Qualcomm management reiterated that the deal shouldn't interfere   with its ability to meet its various obligations -- notably its   dividend -- Skyworks' impressive financial footing and Qualcomm   further leveraging its balance sheet, albeit for a productive   propose, earn Skyworks a clear win in this category.Winner: Skyworks SolutionsImage source: Getty Images.Qualcomm vs. Skyworks: Competitive analysisSkyworks and Qualcomm both enjoy powerful business models,   though each has a few important risks that could derail their   investment theses under the wrong circumstances.Qualcomm is the leading provider of mobile application   processors and baseband chips, which enable mobile devices to   connect with 3G and 4G networks. Its Qualcomm CDMA Technologies   (QCT) segment produces about two-thirds of the company's revenues   and generates pre-tax margins that typically hover in the high   teens. Qualcomm's true profit center, though, is its Qualcomm   Technology Licensing (QTL) segment. Thanks to Qualcomm's pivotal   role in developing 3G and 4G standards, the company has   historically been able to generate royalty revenue from every   device produced by mobile OEMs. Though small a percentage of its   total sales, this QTL's royalty revenue is essentially pure   profit, enjoying an 85% pre-tax margin.Critically, Qualcomm's patent licensing practices have come   under immense pressure from ahost of lawsuitsin recent years, which creates a genuine amount of doubt as to   the durability of Qualcomm's profit center, adding a substantial   amount of risk to a company with an otherwise attractive business   model.Looking to Skyworks, the company manufactures over 2,500   chips, including analog semiconductors, switches, and amplifiers,   to a roster of over 2,000 customers. At a high level, Skyworks'   competitive advantages lie in its unique ability to bundle an   increasing number of complex connectivity functions into a   single, space-saving chip. This unique ability made Skyworks an   invaluable supplier to smartphone and tablet makers, and the   company has been handsomely rewarded as mobile devices have   proliferated in the past decade.Looking to the future, Skyworks sees an opportunity to provide   similar solutions to the booming Internet of Things market. By   the year 2020, the company believes there will be 1 billion   personal computers, 2 billion smartphones, and a whopping 43   billion Internet-of-Things-enabled devices operating   globally, and it hopes to provide chips for as many of these as   possible. Though the future indeed looks bright, it's important   to note thatAppleaccounts for 40% of Skyworks' revenue today, so its performance   is disproportionately influenced by Apple's component orders.Winner: SkyworksQualcomm vs. Skyworks valuation analysisTurning to the third section, here's a quick snapshot of three   of the most commonly used valuation metrics for both Skyworks and   Qualcomm.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAQualcomm13.911.29.3Skyworks Solutions19.324.818.4Data source: Yahoo! Finance.In reviewing the metrics, both Skyworks and Qualcomm largely   seem appropriately valued. Qualcomm is expected to grow 1.2% this   year and 2.8% next year. This kind of tepid top-line expansion   combined with its current legal overhang justifies Qualcomm   trading at a fairly compressed multiple. Analysts expect Skyworks   to grow sales 8.6% this year and 10.3% next year. Though above   average, this doesn't merit the same kind of aggressive premium   we see right now at other semiconductor names likeNVIDIA. Though not the sexy call, both companies look fairly valued   today, in my eyes.Winner: TieAnd the winner is...SkyworksAt the end of the day, Qualcomm's outsized legal risk loomed   fairly large in this decision. Though Qualcomm maintains its   innocence, an adverse ruling could materially impact the   company's financial performance or, worse yet, its highly   lucrative business model. Meanwhile, Skyworks' outlook remains   largely favorable looking into the long term, though its   over-reliance on key customers remains far from ideal. Both   companies have positives and negatives, but Skyworks seems like   the better buy today.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL);2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are two ways to get big dividends: you can buy stocks that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stocks that consistently grow their payouts.makeArticleAd();A well-balanced portfolio will include both types of companies, withdividend-growth stocksbeing the cornerstone of a longer-term income strategy.Still, investors sometimes get frustrated with dividend growers because to get their outsized payout growth, you often have to settle for a low current yield. And why buy a risky asset that yields 1% when you can get a long-term Treasury that pays 2%?There are two answers to this question. The first is that Treasuries aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rates go up, the value of your Treasury will go down. If you need to sell early for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stocks will increase their income over time-something Treasuries will never do. In fact, if you choose thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your income skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world's most recognizable and popular brands:Apple Inc.(AAPL).If you read about investing in Apple, you almost always see a focus on iPhone sales, the value of future products and so on. Bears note slowing iPhone sales growth (or negative sales growth), devices that didn't quite catch on and rising competition. Bulls counter that Apple has a valuable and unique market position and innovative products that captivate consumers.Both arguments are really missing the point.The main reason to buy Apple is more boring but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let's start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, meaning Apple's dividend-payout ratio is a measly 24%. But the really amazing thing is how the company's cash flow has exploded and continues to rise:FCF Boots UpYes, there's been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF has already bottomed out and is now back on the rise.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe next thing to consider is Apple's operating margin, which is currently 27%. This is important because it means the company is so profitable that it can continue to pay out dividends at the current payout rate. That operating margin has fallen slightly in recent years, partly as a result of changes in the smartphone market, but it's still historically high:Apple Remains a Profit MonsterNote that we've seen Apple's profit margin remain over 25% since 2009. This is great news for investors, but it also means Apple has become a very different company than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. It's no longer a burgeoning tech firm but an enterprise that reliably and consistently produces cash it can distribute to shareholders. In other words, it's a blue chip stock, not a speculative bet.Again, great news for investors-especially those looking for income. Ironically, many dividend-growth investors forget about Apple, or they may allocate a very small part of their portfolios to the company out of fear that it's risky. That's a mistake.In the last five years since Apple started paying dividends, its payout has soared 50.6%:Strong Dividend GrowthIf we compare that to some of the most popular and supposedly ""safer"" dividend payers, we see that Apple's dividend growth is a big outperformer:Apple Trounces the RestAs you can see,General Electric Company(GE), AT&T Inc.(T), Johnson & Johnson(JNJ), Chevron Corporation(CVX), Consolidated Edison, Inc.(ED)andExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM)are all growing their dividends at a slower pace than Apple.The tech giant also has a lower P/E ratio than all of these names (just 15.6, which is 39% lower than the rest of the S&P 500).It's time to think different about Apple; this is a relatively safe dividend stock that is destined to be a Dividend Aristocrat. While headlines about iPhone sales may cause some volatility in the short term, the company's strong cash generation will reward you with big payouts in the long run.Buy Apple Now … Then Add These 6 High YieldersThere's no doubt Apple is a best-in-class dividend-growth stock. But you also need high yields to go with that dividend growth-especially if you're in or near retirement.Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?That's where the 6 reliable income generators in our new""No-Withdrawal"" retirement portfoliocome in. They throw offrock-solid yields of 6%, 8%, 9% and up.And with an average yield of 8.0%, this portfolio willeasily hand you a $40,000 income stream on a $500,000 nest egg.Each of those payouts is backed byrock-solid balance sheetsandsurging cash flows.Like Apple, these income powerhouses are all cheap now, but I don't expect that to last.These no-drama plays are perfect for 2017, with the market starting to look twitchy after the go-go ""Trump bump.""

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Another area that I think we should spend a little bit of time   focusing on here is some of the international   results, specifically China. I know that four out of Apple's   five geographic operating segments set fresh highs -- all   but Greater China. But, China is really seen as a huge   market opportunity in addition to India, for Apple. Do you want   to put a little color out as to what they said in the call?Evan Niu:Yeah. Like you mentioned, more quarterly records in   terms of all the other geographical segments, which,   again, it's all these little things that are   contributing to this overall overperformance. For   example, Japan grew 20%. Japan is not a huge market for   them, but just the fact that they can still put out   meaningful growth numbers ... Europe was pretty much flat.   But, Greater China, it has bounced back quite a bit sequentially.   In the third quarter, sales were something like $8.7 [billion] to   $9 billion. So, to really bounce back to $16 billion, it's shy of   their all-time record, which was set a year or two ago, around   $18 billion, but it is bouncing back on a sequential basis.   I think there are still lingering concerns about the   smartphone market in China, because it's getting really   competitive with all these low-cost Chinese   vendors really proliferating and flooding the market with   these cheap choices. You can see in their numbers that they've   had trouble in the past year as competition intensifies   on the ground. But I still think that China is a very big,   promising business. It's probably going to be a tough place to   compete. But it's a great market. They're still   growing, they still have to expand the retail footprint.   There's still room to run.Lewis:Yeah. With lower-priced entrants coming into the   market, Apple's brand cachet is only going to give it so much   pricing power. But, you have to think there's still some room to   run there.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and     recommends Apple.

So Why Not Buy Apple?;2/10/2017;"ByWexboy:We all know the type: Born-again value investors who still have that new car smell. No longer clueless, but the market hasn't beaten adequate sense (or humility) into them just yet, so they're still insanely overconfident. Which we tolerate - after all, we were like them once - then they start expounding their new and improved value investing philosophy, and it all goes downhill. I recall one encounter, some years back, where I struggled to get a word in, let alone offer some kind of reality check. Finally, my new guru was forced to pause and finally breathe, so I did the only sensible thing. I lobbed this hand grenade:So why not buy Apple?All I got was a puzzled look. Repeating the question, I then pummeled him with a veritable laundry list ofApple(AAPL) fundamentals and ratios. If he was such a value expert, surely Apple was a screaming value buy? Needless to say, I never got much of a reply, but it stopped him in his tracks and scared him off. Job well done! But the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like a valid question for other investors (and even me). And a question to be asked in a spirit of honest inquiry. I mean, let's look at Apple's numbers today:makeArticleAd();- Net sales have reached $216 billion (as of FY-2016).- Net sales increased by 99% and over 1,000% in last 5 and 10 years, respectively.- Gross margin increased to 39% ($84 billion) in last 10 years.- Operating profit margin more than doubled to 28% ($60 billion) in last 10 years.- Net income increased by 76% and almost 2,200% in last 5 and 10 years.- EPS compounded by 16% pa and 38% pa in last 5 and 10 years.- Net cash and investments increased almost 1,400% to $151 billion in last 10 years.- Current share price (as of cob Feb-7th): $131.53- Current market cap: $690 billion- Current Price/Sales ratio: 3.2 times- Ex-net cash and investments Price/Sales ratio: 2.4 times- Current P/E ratio: 15.7 times- Ex-net cash and investments P/E ratio: 12.1 times- Current FCF ratio: 13.2 times- Ex-net cash and investments FCF ratio: 10.1 timesOk, just take a moment and marvel. Even with the share price now approaching all-time highs again, surely Apple's still a screaming value buy?So why not buy Apple?Ever since, I pose this question to fellow value investors on a regular basis; but I'm not sure I've ever received a satisfactory reply! As in: 'Yes/No, I bought Apple/I decided not to buy Apple - based on a detailed analysis, and the following specific attributes.' Instead, people tend to shrug their shoulders, roll their eyes, flash a rueful grin, and maybe toss out one of the usual objections. I'm sure you can guess a few:- But Apple's market cap is almost $700 billion now!- It's far too well-researched and efficiently priced for investors to ever have an edge.- A much cooler/better/cheaper brand will surely come along for the kids to buy.- It will inevitably hurtle off a cliff into technological obsolescence and irrelevance.- The micro-cap, sum-of-the-parts thesis we discussed is far more interesting.- Steve Jobs is dead… the company's sure to go off the rails any day/month/year now.- Look at thebloody chart- who's going to buy it now, after that rally?Now, before the fanboys start to lose their minds, this is where I should reveal this post is NOT about Apple. No, really.Sorry, fanboys…Study the long-term chart of any outstanding growth stock, and it's quite obvious most of the objections above are just red herrings. Part of a litany of excuses too many value investors trot out to justify hiding within their own circle of comfort. Because we fear the risks and challenges of the unknown. Instead, we reject (or simply ignore) entire sectors and hundreds/thousands of companies, because we've decided they're just too large, too expensive, too unpredictable, too uninteresting, to be worthy of consideration.And then we citeBuffett: Always remain within yourcircle of competence!Except this rule would imply buying no individual stocks - since newbie investors should always choose passive investing initially, as the most prudent choice. And anyway, Buffett evolved his investing approach and continually expanded his circle of competence over his entire career. [Yefei Lu'snew Buffett bookoffers good perspective]. Mere mortals should emulate such an evolution - not Buffett himself! Unless you plan on being a deca-billionaire too - then you can avoid/invest in absolutely anything you fancy.Let's not forget, when Buffett started out, technology was a nascent sector - which required a VC approach - something he clearly wasn't too comfortable with. [But readPhilip Fisheragain: Now, he was a great venture capitalist - albeit one who chose to invest in listed companies]. And technology-related hype/promotion during theGo-Go Yearsprobably compounded this aversion, which Buffett rationalized as avoiding the sector's obvious unpredictability. Except that never stopped him from investing in the likes of banks and retail! Which are potentially just as lethal and unpredictable, but obviously they were sectors in which he was actually comfortable investing.But in sticking religiously to his comfort zone, Buffett also displayed his true genius. His apparent caution is deceptive - rest assured, he never doubted his investing ability. Instead, he deliberately chose to leverage his prowess in a new and more aggressive way, via the use of long-term, interest-free insurancefloatanddeferred taxes. Of course, the potential risks of taking on such significant leverage would ensure he remained laser-focused on investing (primarily) in predictable sectors and businesses, and obviously inspired his two main rules:Rule No. 1: Never lose money.Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.Couple this with super-human patience and fifty years later it seems almost inevitable Buffett's actually accrued an entirely unique investment record.Whereas we don't have the luxury of float. And it's 2017: We live in a world where technology and innovation play an ever increasing role, for decades now, in all aspects of our economy, workplaces and daily lives. And technology isn't (necessarily) any more unpredictable than biotech/pharma, fashion, media, retail, natural resources, emerging/frontier markets, etc. But it deserves far more focus and study - since its potential impact on other sectors, in terms of innovation and disruption, is obviously far greater today (and as we look ahead). [Withautonomous trucksnow being tested on open highways, it's both astonishing and alarming to realizetruck drivingmay still be the most common male occupation in the US! (with almost 3 million drivers)].A value investor who deliberately avoids technology and other such (unpredictable) sectors is foregoing a world of investment opportunity - especially now, when an ever increasing share of economic value-creation is derived from technology, not to mention other intangible assets and intellectual property. And trapped in a low-growth, low-return world (like today - or in due course, as debt and entitlements keep escalating), such investors may end up condemned to choosing between: i) traditional blue chip/Buffett classics (e.g. food and beverage stocks) which now seem to trade at ever-expanding multiples (vs. historic and prospective earnings growth), or ii) traditional value stocks which can perhaps no longer rely on a rising tide of growth, inflation and animal spirits. Who can afford such risks and opportunity cost?But for many value investors, we're far more comfortable with the numbers, rather than the story itself. Which is, potentially, our downfall [And vice versa for growth investors]. The hard assets and cheap metrics of your typical value stock offer the siren song of safety, whereas investing in high quality/growth stocks may require a far more demanding leap of faith. Except value stocks are often mired in bad management, bad business models, bad industries and dreadful capital allocation - with little hope of compounding their intrinsic value - the best we can hope for is a realization of intrinsic value.If you're a human computer who loves to re-rank and re-invest in the world's cheapest stocks every day, such an event-driven portfolio may be rewarding (and the studies do claim value beats growth), but in the real world how many investors manage to deliver sustained long-term outperformance with such an approach? Maybe a passive, computer-driven portfolio is the better solution, especially when the greatest human computer of them all (i.e. Buffett) has long since abandoned such an approach. In the end, value investing will always be a marvelous valuation tool and framework for investing, but its greatest failing doesn't lie in the stocks it green-lights for you to buy…It actually lies in the stocks it persuades youNOTto buy!I suspect most value investors will freely acknowledge this failing. And embrace the proposition that investing in high quality/growth stocks is ultimately a far more attractive way of compounding long-term portfolio value (particularly on a tax-deferred basis),IF ONLYit weren't so difficult! Because such an investing approach must inevitably be driven by qualitative, not quantitative, analysis. And it conflicts with having our cake and eating it - we want the best companies and the best prices! In reality, we need to compromise and choose wonderful companies at fair prices, not fair companies at wonderful prices. Which actually offers a far more compelling value equation, since time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.And so, paying up is often required - well, at least from a traditional value perspective - which, almost inevitably needs to be justified via comprehensive study of the company and its management, its capital allocation, its products and business model, its industry dynamics, and (most of all) whether it enjoys a significant, sustainable and (ideally) an expanding competitive advantage (i.e. aneconomic moat). An exercise which is surely infinitely more challenging than assessing and ranking a bunch of value metrics. And one which can go horribly wrong - a busted value thesis may engender some rueful sympathy (wow, who knew management were such idiots?), but paying up for a high flier just before it collapses will inevitably attract a perfect storm of hindsight and sniggers for making such a bone-headed investment decision. But then again, nailing even a single multi-bagger growth stock might yield a payoff value investors can only ever dream of.Of course, today the answer might not be Apple. But next up there's a world of other compelling investment opportunities out there just waiting to be explored. Which means it's still an excellent question to kick off your search:So why not buy Apple?See alsoRevlon Corp.: Will This Sleeping Giant Come Back To Life?on seekingalpha.com"
Warren Buffett's Best Stocks of 2017 So Far;2/10/2017;"We're just over a month into 2017, so let's look at how the   Warren Buffett-ledBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) stock portfolio has done thus far.   Berkshire itself is almost completely flat for the year, down   0.09% as of this writing, but some of the company's stock   holdings have done quite well. Specifically, five of Berkshire's   stocks have gained 10% or more over the first five weeks of the   year.CompanyStock SymbolmakeArticleAd();Share Price (2/7/2017)YTD PerformanceLiberty Media (A Shares)LBTYA$35.54+16.2%Moody's Corp.MCO$107.06+13.6%AppleAAPL$131.53+13.5%Charter CommunicationsCHTR$323.37+12.3%VisaV$85.78+10%Performance and share prices as of market close on   2/7/2017.Image Source: Getty Images.1. Liberty Media (+16.2%)Liberty Media(NASDAQ: LBTYK) has been Berkshire's biggest winner thus far in   2017, thanks to impressive growth in its European markets. The   company expects the growth to continue as it speeds up its U.K.   build activity and makes major investments in its business there.   In addition, the company has been aggressively repurchasing its   shares, especially in the wake of the Brexit sell-off last   year.2. Moody's (+13.6%)Ratings agencyMoody's(NYSE: MCO) has steadily climbed so far in 2017, partially   because of its announcement that it had resolved pending civil   claims with the Justice Department, 21 states, and D.C. Not only   were the claims resolved faster than many experts expected, but   the cost to the company will be significantly less than many   expected.3. Apple (+13.5%)In part,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) rally has been due to its strong results from   the holiday shopping season. For the quarter, Apple's revenue of   $78.4 billion was as high as it has ever been, and the company's   earnings and revenue both handily exceeded expectations.Perhaps most importantly, Apple's service revenue (which   includes sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, Apple   Pay, and others) grew by 18% year-over-year. While this accounts   for just 9% of the company's results, it is rapidly becoming an   important revenue stream to the company. Furthermore, Apple   expects revenue to continue to climb in the current quarter, and   CEO Tim Cook said that the company is ""excited"" about the   products in its pipeline.4. Charter Communications (+12.3%)InCharter Communications'(NASDAQ: CHTR) case, the reason for the strong stock performance   wasn't necessarily due to strong growth or other great business   metrics. Rather, the stock spiked in mid-January on rumors thatVerizon(NYSE: VZ) was considering an acquisition of the company. Many   think that the deal is unlikely to happen, for reasons my   colleague Anders Bylund explained in a recentarticle, but the rumors have not faded just yet.5. Visa (+10%)In its latest quarterly report,Visa(NYSE: V) reported impressive year-over-year earnings growth of   7%, and revenue growth of 25% thanks to the acquisition of Visa   Europe.Service revenue, data processing revenue, and international   transaction revenue all soared, and while operating expenses grew   by 16%, the company still posted impressive growth. For fiscal   year 2017, the company expects net revenue growth of 16%-18%, and   EPS growth in the ""mid-teens"" on an adjusted basis. It's fair to   say that Visa's fiscal 2017 -- the most recent quarter was the   first of its fiscal year -- is going well so far.Are any of these good buysnow?To be clear, I'm not saying that you should buy these, or any   other stocks simply because Warren Buffett owns them. However,   Berkshire invested in each of these companies for a reason, and   we can learn valuable investing lessons from these purchases, as   well as from how the stocks perform over time.Having said that, I would have to call Apple the best buy on   this list right now, as it still trades for a compelling   valuation even after the recent rally, and I tend to gravitate   toward undisputed leaders in their markets.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc. Takes Another Shot at Amazon With Home Control;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home connected speaker takes onAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa on its home turf. But what about Google's big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war - all those smartphones?makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleThe company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.However, at this point, Home Control - like Google Assistant - remains a feature that's exclusive to Google's own Pixel Phones.The Battle for the Smart HomeGoogle Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.The device is GOOGL's answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon's Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub - despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, whileApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers' hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.Apple's Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out asimilar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control.Home ControlGoogle's new feature for voice control of smart devices isn't actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayHowever, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don't get.With Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.The Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home - the one who controls all those smart devices - the smartphone was it.Smartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google.Then Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, afterselling nine times moreof the smart speaker than the previous year.Voice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0However, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it's bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone.Except, most of those people still won't be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that's been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon's number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant.For GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceNo, Apple Inc.

"News Corp (NWSA) Q2 Earnings Top; Soft Ad Market Hurt Sales";2/10/2017;"Rupert Murdoch-controlled,News CorporationNWSAreported profit in second-quarter fiscal 2017 after posting loss in the previous quarter.  Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by robust performance of digital real-estate and book publishing units. However, the company's revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter primarily due to soft print advertising demand and foreign currency headwinds.News Corporation registered adjusted earnings of 19 cent a share outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 5% year over year. Including one-time items, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and New York Post reported net loss from continuing operations of 50 cents a share compared with earnings of 15 cents posted in the year-ago period.News Corporation, which split from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.FOXA, stated that its total revenue for the reported quarter was $2,116 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,137 million. Adverse foreign currency fluctuations hurt total revenue by $53 million.The company's adjusted revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency fluctuations and divestitures) came in at $2,110 million, reflecting a decline of 1.3% year over year.Total advertising revenues declined 8.3% to $748 million, while circulation and subscription revenues fell 4.2% to $595 million. Consumer revenues increased 4.9% to $450 million, while revenues from real estate climbed 15.6% to $185 million. Meanwhile, Other revenues gained 2.2% to $138 million.News Corporation, which offers e-books for devices sold by Amazon.com Inc.AMZNand Apple Inc.AAPL, is in a transitional phase, looking to diversify revenue streams, along with expanding digital properties through product launches and accretive acquisitions.Following the results, the company's shares gained 1.6% in after-hour trading session yesterday. In fact in the past one year, the stock has performed mostly on par with the Zacks categorizedMovie/TV Production/Distributionindustry gaining more than 19%.Segmental PerformanceRevenues from theNews and Information Servicessegment declined 7% year over year to $1,303 million in the reported quarter. Adjusted revenues fell 5% from the prior-year period. Advertising revenues decreased 9%, hurt by the adverse impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the print advertising market, partly offset by $22 million from the addition of Wireless Group and increased in-store product revenues at News America Marketing.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 5%. However, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the figure inched up 1% on account of increase in subscription pricing, selected rise in cover prices in the U.K. and Australia and jump in paid digital subscribers, partly neutralized by fall in print volume. Digital revenues accounted for 27% of segment revenues in the quarter under review compared with 22% in the year-ago period. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 10% during the quarter to $142 million.TheBook Publishingsegment reported revenues of $466 million, up 4% from the prior-year period owing to continued success of backlist titles comprising Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance, and Sarah Young Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. Digital sales which constituted 16% of consumer revenues increased 3% in the quarter. Adjusted revenues for the segment rose 6%. While adjusted EBITDA for News Corporation's book publishing business surged 35% to $77 million.Revenues at theDigital Real Estate Servicessegment advanced 16% year over year to $242 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group Limited (up 19%) and Move (up 7%), along with the buyout of iProperty and Diakrit. Adjusted revenues grew 10% in the quarter under review, while adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $92 million.TheCable Network Programmingsegment's revenues came in at $104 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter primarily due to decline in affiliate and advertising revenues.

Pandora (P) Earnings: Fourth Quarter Loss Widens;2/10/2017;"Like a broken record that skips, investors continue to ask when Pandora (P) will ever make money?The company’s inability to prove its business model can be lucrative has cost investors tons of money over the past three years, during which Pandora stock has fallen more than 65%. On Thursday it was the same old song. Shares of the internet music giant declined as much as 4% in after hours trading session after the company reported a wider loss in the fourth quarter, driven by higher expenses.In the three months that ended December, the Oakland-based company reported a loss of $90 million, or 38 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains, costs and stock option expense and pretax expenses, the loss was 13 cents per share, which beat Wall Street estimates by 8 cents. Fourth quarter revenue came to $392.6 million, up about 17% year over year and also topping Street forecasts.makeArticleAd();""We made significant progress in 2016 by driving leverage in our core business while accelerating subscriptions to our paid product,"" said CEO Tim Westergren, in a statement. Adding that the company is now ""laser-focused"" on growing ad-supported business and launching subscription products and an artist-to-fan platform.Pandora, which has been subject to frequent acquisition rumors linking it to Apple (AAPL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), has struggled to grow profits since the bulk of its users don’t pay anything. To diversify the business, which has been bogged down by music licensing fees, the company recently launched Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium subscription services.Still, the fact that the lion share of its revenue (about 80%) still comes from advertising, not subscriptions, Pandora still has a long way to go. And despite being a smaller segment of the business, Subscriptions only brought in under $60 million, climbing just 5% year over year. This, too, suggests that Pandora is struggling to compete on the premium side with market leaders Spotify and Apple.All told, these numbers — on their own — aren’t as bad as the stock’s decline might suggest. The fact that Pandora reported a smaller loss than what analysts expected shows that the company, which has promised to cut 7% of its US workforce, is reining in on costs. As to why the stock is down despite the earnings and revenue beat?This was likely a “sell the news” type of event. The management had already removed the element of surprise by announcing last month that the results would surpass guidance. With the stock rising some 21% over the past month, investors were hoping for something more breathtaking."
Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings: Why This Q4 Beat Was Really Important;2/10/2017;"Nvidia earnings (Shutterstock photo)It appears the only thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climbing higher are investors’ expectations. Thanks to the company’s advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), NVDA shares have soared some 340% over the past year, crushing every important index.As such, the California-based semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-line numbers that cruised by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answered the call. But the shares appear muted, falling as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantage point, this decline, which I consider inconsequential, is victory for Nvidia and its investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’s go though the numbers.In the three months that ended December, Nvidia reported net a income of $655 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensus estimates by a whopping 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenue also beat, coming in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street was looking for revenue of $2.11 billion.The strong bottom-line beat was driven by record quarterly GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the company said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When looking back at fiscal 2016, the company broke several of its own records, including full-year revenue of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""We had a great finish to a record year, with continued strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. Huang also added that Nvidia’s deep learning GPUs (graphical processing units) has made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in early cancer detection, weather prediction and is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars.All told, it is these breakthrough areas that continue to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believer until now. And while the tech battle has always been between Apple (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guys are not alone anymore.In terms of the 3% decline on these solid numbers? Nvidia is being shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to decline 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still imply the momentum story is still in place. And Nvidia’s Q1 outlook for revenue to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estimates of $1.88 billion, suggests it sees no signs of slowing down."
No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA report began circulating several days ago thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) may start production of the iPhone 8 early. Typically, when a company starts manufacturing sooner than usual, that points to an accelerated release date for a new product.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleIn this case, it seems unlikely the move will result in an iPhone release date before Apple's standard September launch.If not to get it on shelves sooner, why would the company want to get an early start on new iPhone production?The iPhone 8 Early Production Ramp UpApple has a pretty standard roadmap when it comes to new iPhone releases. With a late September iPhone release date, the company starts to ramp up production of the new model in late summer. However, this year it looks as though Apple may be breaking with tradition.According to a report from BlueFin Research Partners, there are indicators in the company's supply chain that point to an unusually early production ramp up for the iPhone 8. Quoted inMSN Money,the BlueFin report notes:""The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that Apple is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms.""Why Early Production Won't Lead to an Earlier iPhone Release DateBefore anyone gets too excited about the possibility of an early iPhone 8 release, that scenario is highly unlikely.First, ramping up production in June means Apple will begin having stock of the new iPhones in warehouses by the summer. But no one releases a flagship smartphone during the summer months - that's a slow time for consumer technology news. People are on vacation and not only would an iPhone announcement not get the coverage Apple expects for its new product launches, with so many people away the line-ups at Apple Stores the company is hoping for wouldn't happen.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in the Trump EraAn early release would also reduce iPhone 7 sales. Now that production is humming on that model, Apple wouldn't want to kneecap it by releasing the iPhone 8 early.So Why Would Apple Ramp up iPhone 8 Production Early?It's become increasingly obvious that companies like Apple are pushing the limits of their supply chain and manufacturing partners with their latest smartphones. The new dual camera system, haptic Home button and other components led to a shortage of some iPhone 7 models at launch. Apple ramped up production in late summer as usual,but these issues caused delays.I preordered an iPhone 7 Plus, but still waited a month after the new iPhones went on sale before mine was available …Then there's the issue of batteries. Apple has had to face its own headaches withiPhone 6 and 6s batteries, but those problems pale in comparison to the nightmare rivalSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has gone through with the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries.There's a lot riding on the iPhone 8 and Apple appears to be throwing all sorts of new features, cutting-edge technology and a completely new design at its 10th anniversary iPhone. Glass construction, wireless charging, an OLED display, virtual Home button and more. The company is even rumored to becharging $1,000-plusfor its new flagship, an unprecedented price for a smartphone.In addition, Samsung will likely be introducing its new Galaxy Note around the same time, and pulling out all the stops to make that phablet such a smash hit that everyone forgets about the Galaxy Note 7.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also expected to release the followup to the worryingly successful Google Pixel Phone in the fall.Rather than ramping up for an early launch, it's far more likely that Apple is starting iPhone 8 production early in order to iron out all the manufacturing bugs early. Virtually all of the components will be new and Apple will undoubtedly be pushing the limits of manufacturing capability. Having an early start will ensure any issues are caught well before the iPhone 8 goes on sale, ensuring a smooth, scandal-free, launch. And no embarrassing issues for the competition to take advantage of.The early ramp up also ensures that even if things don't go smoothly at first, there will be plenty of iPhone 8 smartphones sitting in Apple warehouses in September, ensuring a record-setting launch.Should Under Armour Inc (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank Step Aside?Despite the apparent early production ramp up, don't expect an iPhone release date in the summer. But Apple's move does mean you should have a flawless iPhone 8 in your hands at the launch, instead of waiting weeks or months for supply to catch up to demand.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe postNo, Apple Inc.

Despite Generous Capital Returns, Apple Inc. Still Has More Cash Than Ever Before;2/9/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  overseas cash position continues to grow   at an incredible rate, and the possibility of some type of   repatriation holiday is the highest it has been in years, thanks   to the new Trump administration.In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior technology   specialist Evan Niu discuss Apple's cash position and financial   structure.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Speaking of their international segments, I think it might   make sense to check in on their cash hoard a little bit. As of   their recent report, Apple is sitting on $246 billion in cash.   Because they do so much business outside of the U.S. and   because of certain current tax regulations, $230 billion of that   total, or roughly 94%, is held outside the U.S. Morgan   Stanley analyst Katy Hubertyasked [CEO] Tim Cook on the call about what the company   might be thinking with the current administration, and the   possibility of repatriating some of that cash. I think that was a   question a lot of people wanted an answer to.Evan Niu:Yeah. That's one of the big things that the Trump   administration is pushing, is this tax reform, including a   potential repatriation holiday. If they could bring back a lot of   that cash, there are certainly a couple things they could do   with it. Cook didn't really give a lot of clear guidance on   what he's thinking. But, you could buy some companies.   He keep saying that Apple is open to really big   acquisitions if they fit, if they make sense, all these   things. But he's basically not concerned about pricing anymore.   You could buy some companies, you could invest in the   U.S., you could potentially bring production back.   Obviously, that's another big thing that Trump is pushing.Another thing I would actually like to see is strengthen   the balance sheet. The whole reason they have the $70   billion-plus in debt is because it's always been a way to   avoid the repatriation taxes. So, if they can repatriate at   appealing rates, it might also make sense to pay down some   of that debt, because that way, you can avoid some of the   interest expense, and it strengthens your balance sheet a little.   Not that the balance sheet is weak, by any stretch of the   imagination. It all nets out in the end. But, logistically,   it would be nice to bring that money back, pay down some debt.   Because, if this is a one-time deal that they can bring back   a ton of money, I would expect them to keep generating   ridiculous amounts of cash overseas, and then they would want to   raise more debt, again, to be able to tap that, in the   same way they have been doing, but if they could pay down that   debt, that basically gives them even more time to keep   pursuing the same strategy. And if they're taking advantage   of a one-time tax holiday, I think that would make sense,   from a corporate finance standpoint.Lewis:Yeah. Even with $70 billion in debt, where they had to   repatriate a lot of that cash that's held overseas, they   still have quite a bit to work with. I think on the call,   Huberty specifically asked about what merger and acquisition   activity to expect, or if they might continue to invest   in original content and programming that would make the   Apple ecosystem seem a little bit more appealing. I think because   she led with that question and had some specific examples of   where cash might go, Cook's response followed along with   that. But, I was hoping we might get some color about   an increase in the dividend, or an update on what the   company was thinking with share repurchase where they'd have   that extra capital on hand. But, nothing there at the   moment. Cook was notoriously cagey, as always, in his   response.Niu:Yeah. He didn't really give a lot away there.   They usually update their capital return program every   April. So, next quarter, we will get some insight. They did   buy back $11 billion in shares this quarter. Which partially   helps juice the earnings-per-share number, which is another   record, because they are able to retire so many   shares. They retired something like 62 million shares last   quarter. That's really highly accretive to that   earnings-per-share figure, even though net income was   actually down slightly relative to a year ago, in part   because of foreign exchange headwinds and things of that   nature. So, right now, they are up to about $144 billion   in cumulative repurchases, and the current authorization is   $175 billion. So they still have plenty of room. They only   have one more quarter before they update it again.   But I would expect them to give another update and increase   it again in a couple months, because this   business creates so much cash that they literally have   no idea what to do with it. [laughs] I mean, think   about how much money they have given back, and the fact that   they still have more money now than they've ever had before. So,   it's like, they're trying to give this cash back at this   ridiculous rate, but they generate so much of it that it   still adds on a net basis to their total cash position, even   after giving back so much over the years. It's mind-boggling.Lewis:And that's with them continuing to invest in the   future, as well. You hear about some of the different   projects that they may or may not be funding, and some of   the initiatives they might be pushing. It's not like   they're sitting on their heels here. They're certainly   throwing money into seeing where tech might be going. It's just   that, with this type of money available to them, you can   only do so much of it with reinvesting in the business and with   R&D. I mean, that's the beauty of having a cash cow   business like that.Niu:It's just insane how much they make.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Voice Control Platforms a Key Technology Trend in 2017;2/9/2017;"Technology companies have spent years on computational linguistics to solve the basic problem of making machines more efficient in an era where they would have to deal with bigger data loads and more complex queries. One of the products of this research is voice driven artificial intelligence that can connect and drive everyday devices to understand human speech and react accordingly.The most basic form of voice technology is a person directing a machine to do routine tasks such as play a track, read the mail, send automated response to mails and such things that Apple'sAAPLSiri, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle Now or Microsoft'sMSFTCortana took care of. Home automation is a more recent trend and wouldn't it be cool if most of the smart devices/appliances used in the home can also take voice commands? And sync with each other to decide the desirable activity and then get it done?Amazon AheadWhile Microsoft has many years of research behind it, it is AmazonAMZNthat has really taken voice controlled platforms mainstream. The company launched its first Echo device a couple of years ago and sold more than seven million devices last year. While many of them were the cheaper Dot, it still puts Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant into that many new homes.At this year's CES, Amazon had a coup as companies ranging from FordF, Huawei and LG to a large number of startups unveiled phones, cars, home appliances and other gadgets with Alexa integration making Amazon's voice assistant that much more useful.And Amazon has doubled down to develop Alexa's ""skills,"" which are discrete voice-based applications that allow the system to carry out specific tasks (like ordering pizza for example). At launch, Alexa had just 20 skills, which has reportedly jumped to 5,200 today with the company adding about 100 skills per day.In fact, Bezos has said, ""We've been working behind the scenes for the last four years, we have more than 1,000 people working on Alexa and the Echo ecosystem … It's just the tip of the iceberg.""Just last week, it launched a new website to help brands and developers create more skills for Alexa. It also has a home consultation service called ""simplify your life"" where Amazon reps teach you to automate your home using Echo and Alexa. But all this works simply because everything is connected with AWS, which transmits data between different devices.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteGoogle Has Jumped InAmazon is clearly the leader in voice controlled platforms today, but competition is in hot pursuit. Google Home was launched late last year and the search leader will do all it can to grow market share.To prove the point Google too had some important announcements for the Google Assistant, which drives Google Home. But some of the most important deals were for integrations into Hyundai's navigation system, Chrysler's 300 model, NVIDIA'sNVDAShield TV as well as others such as Belkin smart switches, Switchmate smart lights, Coway Airmega air purifiers, etc. Google still has miles to go before it catches up with Amazon, but it's made a strong start.Google has the most to lose if it can't make it big here because a lot of voice search will probably happen through these assistants going forward. But it also has an advantage, i.e., all the information it has curated over the years, your preferences and your habits that it can draw from to serve you. In short, it knows you better.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus|Alphabet Inc. QuoteApple Also in the FrayApple doesn't have a separate Home device, but a useful app of the same name that can connect all the smart devices in your home and get them to communicate with each other. So it's also dependent on the number of gadget makers supporting the app and this number has been swelling in the recent past.While Apple's partners aren't making the news as much as the other two, there are a host of switch, light, camera, sensor, security system and other such device makers that have been announcing their support for Apple's platform the last couple of CESs (Apple makes it a point to stay away from the show).Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteSamsung Taking NoticeSamsung paid a cool $8 billion to acquire auto infotainment, acoustics, display and other systems supplier Harman. That is a big sum to pay, although justified considering that Harman does offer a number of products that would be complementary with the displays and chips that are an important part of the increasingly electronic and soon-to-be self-driving cars. IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow from $42 billion in 2016 to $61 billion next year.But there's more: just last year, Harman announced a number of collaborations indicating its growing importance in the world of voice activated controls. In September, it agreed to incorporate Baidu speech recognition and synthesis technology in smart speakers so people can use voice commands to turn on audio experiences and access on-demand services.Earlier, the two collaborated to create CarLife offering advanced Internet capabilities, entertainment features and location-based services on HARMAN's in-vehicle infotainment head units for the Chinese market. At the World of Watson conference last October, Harman collaborated with IBM to bring voice activated intelligent assistance based on IoT and cognitive computing to hotels, offices and hospitals across the world.Along Comes SoundHoundKeyvan Mohajer of SoundHound says, ""We are at the inflection point of our long-term vision that every product or service needs to have a smart voice-enabled interface, and consumers have increasingly high expectations for this requirement, beyond simple commands or skills,"" said Mohajer.He may be right because of the $115 million raised in its 10-year long life, $75 million was contributed just last week from a group of companies including NVIDIA, Samsung's Catalyst Fund, Nomura Holdings, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Recruit Holdings' RSI Fund, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, SharesPost 100 Fund and MKaNN. Global Catalyst Partners, Walden Venture Capital and Translink Capital Partners participated for a second time.The reason the investment is significant at this juncture is SoundHound's voice interface technology called Houndify that will now be empowered to reach more users. Houndify was incorporated into more than 500 products within the first 12 months of launch.Its popularity in the past and why companies like Samsung and NVIDIA are interested in it right now is simple. The technology is not designed to take over the device or transfer data to SoundHound unlike platforms like Alexa and Google Home. So its proliferation will let device makers employ the technology and also retain user data. Houndify already has 20K developers working on the platform and this number could expand rapidly with the cash infusion. Houndify already hasSumming UpInteraction with machines is set to become more interesting than ever before as they gradually understand our needs to get things done the way we want it even before we tell them to or perhaps right after. Since this is a nascent market, there may not be any clear winners. Right now it does look as if there's enough growth opportunity for all the above players and more.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Best ETFs Of 2017 Target Growth Stocks, Gold Miners, Brazil Small Caps;2/9/2017;"[ibd-display-video id=458207]Growth stocks provided a rich seam of gains for   domestic stock ETFs in the past month, as shares of tech   leadersFacebook(FB),Adobe(ADBE) andApple(AAPL) rekindled after noticeably lagging the postelection   rally.Investors in exchange traded funds were in a perhaps exuberant   mood as stock market volatility hit its lowest level in   years and the venerable Dow Jones industrial average crossed   the psychologically key 20,000 mark, Matthew Bartolini and David   Mazza of State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) wrote in a   recent note.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');A risk-on mood seems to prevail amongETF   investorsas ""the current U.S. equity bull market is less than 30 trading   days away from its eighth birthday,"" they added.However, there are some yellow flags.""Valuations are elevated and earnings growth is positive, but   not overwhelming so,"" said Bartolini and Mazza. ""Confounding the   exuberance is the fact that bond market volatility remains   decidedly elevated, nearly 6% higher than prior to the election,   while equity volatility has fallen by over 36%.""SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) climbed 0.9% in the month ended Feb. 8, padding gains of 2.6%   year to date and 12% in 2016.International stock ETFs did even better in the past   month.Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) advanced 4.4% and iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), investing in foreign   developed markets, added 1.2%.Equity ETFs listed in the U.S. notched just under $30 billion   in net inflow in January - the third month in a row since   the Nov. 8 election that investors poured more than $25 billion   into equity ETFs, according to SSGA. Fixed income ETFs saw $13.41   billion in net inflow last month, following the record $90   billion of fresh assets they gathered in 2016.Looking ahead, Bartolini and Mazza suggest that truly   exuberant ETF investors should consider allocating to ETFs   tracking sectors that may benefit from President Trump's   policies, such as real assets, oil and gas producers and regional   banks.Other ETF investors may want to position for downside risk in   thestock marketand consider investing in gold, they added.These are among the year's best-performing ETFs in   some key asset classes, screened for trading volume:Diversified U.S. EquitiesFirst Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted (QQEW) gives every stock   in its underlying tech-focused, nonfinancial index an equal share   of assets.

It has a 0.6% expense ratio.The market-cap weighted version of the index, as tracked by   PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), is up 6.8% year to date.Sector EquitiesVanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) bets on an asset   class that was badly beaten down in the first half of this decade   but has since burnished its allure.It invests in 52 global gold- and silver-mining firms   includingIamgold(IMG) andAlamos Gold(AGI), with a pronounced tilt toward small- and midcap firms.GDXJ has vaulted 33.7% so far in 2017 and 19.2% in the   past month, extending a superb 72.9% rally last year.

The iPhone is Growing Again -- Here's How;2/9/2017;"Last quarter, the iPhone broke a trend of three consecutive   quarters of unit declines, thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7   and 7 Plus. In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA discuss   howApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  most important business is faring.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Why don't we hop right into the iPhone segment? This is   really where they're making most of their money.Evan Niu:Yeah. They sold another record of 78.3 million. The last   three consecutive quarters, they put up negative growth. So,   they put an end to that trend. Of course, this creates   another tough comparison for next year, raises the bar for a year   from now. But, personally, I wasn't that impressed with the   iPhone 7 as a product.Lewis:Do you own it?Niu:No. It's the first time in eight years that I haven't   upgraded my phone. [laughs]Lewis:I don't own the iPhone 7 either, so don't feel   bad. [laughs]Niu:But, literally every year I've been upgrading, this is   the first time I'm not, because I just didn't think it was   that compelling. But, obviously the market really does. Part   of it is that the 7 Plus is really the hot seller this   quarter. Apple even acknowledged that they did a poor   job predicting demand. They allocated less than they should have   to the 7 Plus production. There's not really a killer   feature in the iPhone this year. Arguably, the biggest thing is   the dual camera system that is specifically for the 7 Plus.   So, it seems like a lot of people are picking that bigger   phone. I think it costs $120 extra now. You can see it in the   numbers. They put up really strong results here.Lewis:Yeah. And I think you really see that when you look at   average selling price. That grew to $695 in the most recent   quarter, up from $619 in the previous quarter. And a lot of   that is the 7 Plus model, and consumers clearly voting for   the better camera, and being willing to pony up a little bit   more dough for it.Niu:And/or extra storage, because those things shoot 4K   video, and you need a lot of storage to store all that.Lewis:Yeah. absolutely. So, if you put those two   numbers together, the units and average selling   price, you get roughly $54.5 billion in revenue.   So, right now, we're looking at the iPhone segment making up   about 70% of revenue for Apple for this quarter. Higher   than it's been in the past, but not necessarily   surprising, because the iPhone segment was so massively   popular and so successful this quarter.Niu:Yeah. They were so supply constrained the entire   quarter. They acknowledged that they didn't meet supply-demand   balance until January. So, they were pretty short   on inventory throughout the entire quarter. To still be able   to hit these numbers even with constraints   and, arguably, not a super strong feature set -- I was   kind of blown away, honestly.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Apple, Inc. iPhone Sales in China Reportedly Fell 18% Last Year;2/9/2017;"China has been the world's largest smartphone market for a few   years now, underscoring how important the region is forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . But the Mac maker has hit a speed bump in the   Middle Kingdom in recent quarters, largely due to intensifying   competition from local, low-cost manufacturers. The company   occasionally mentions growth rates for various geographical   markets, but doesn't disclose unit sales by region in detail.   That leaves investors having to rely on third-party estimates,   and the most recent ones don't look good.We're No. 5! We're No. 5!Market researcherCanalysreleased its estimates today for the Chinese smartphone market in   2016. Total unit volumes in China hit a fresh high of 476.5   million handsets, up 11%. Of that total, roughly 131.6 million   units were shipped in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record that   represents a third of the global market. The top four brands were   all Chinese manufacturers; Apple came in at No. 5 amid declining   unit volumes.ManufacturermakeArticleAd();2016 UnitsHuawei76.2 millionOppo73.2 millionVivo63.2 millionXiaomi51.4 millionApple43.8 millionData source: Canalys.Both Xiaomi and Apple saw double-digit declines from 2015   levels, with Xiaomi's units falling 21% and Apple's units down   18%. Oppo and Vivo exploded onto the scene in 2016; both   companies sold fewer than 40 million units in 2015. Huawei   strengthened its position in the tier-one and tier-two cities,   according to Canalys analyst Jessie Ding. Oppo and Vivo are now   looking to target those regions, while Huawei moves in on   tier-three and tier-four cities.iPhone 7 with AirPods. Image source: Apple.While Apple has never aspired to be the largest vendor in any   market by volumes, instead focusing on other things like customer   satisfaction and profitability, that's still a discouraging   directional trend at a time when Apple has been trying to   reinvigorate investor confidence. The iPhone maker's decline in   China is also significantly worse than its worldwide volumes;   iPhone units fell 7% in 2016 to 215.4 million. If we look at it   in absolute units, Canalys' numbers suggest that Apple sold 9.7   million less units in China in 2016, which is a large proportion   of the 16.1 million unit decline in total iPhone units. China is   becoming an increasingly tough market, and it's weighing on   results.""A very, very difficult market""Last quarter, Greater China was the only geographical segment   of Apple's five reportable segments that did not hit record   levels.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.Apple's Greater China segment includes Hong Kong, China, and   Taiwan. The weakness appears to be coming from Hong Kong and   Taiwan, and revenue in mainland China was roughly flat with the   record levels from a year ago. Here's CEO Tim Cook on the   call:If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca     shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12% and about 4     points of that was currency related. So it's an 8-point decline     in constant currency. And then within Greater China if you look     at the [People's Republic of China], our revenue was flat year     over year, and that was against the all-time record     quarter.Cook also conceded that Hong Kong ""remains a very, very   difficult market.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

If these rumors hold true, then it isn't hard to see how the device will surpass the $1,000 price point. The iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB of memory costs $969 in the United States. This rumor comes from sources that are close to AAPL's plans.2017 iPhone Charging:A recent rumor claims that Apple will introduce wireless charging to all three 2017 iPhone devices,9to5Macnotes. This rumor comes from KGI analysts Ming Chi Kuo. Previous reports have claimed that only the premium 2017 iPhone, which may be the iPhone 8, will offer wireless charging. This rumor also claims that the premium iPhone coming out this year will feature an OLED display and a 3D Touch sensor. Kuo claims that the premium device will require an extra layer of graphite to protect the 3D Touch sensor from heat caused by the wireless charging component.Beats X Deal:Apple is offering a special deal to customers that purchase its new Beats X earbuds, reportsAppleInsider. Customers that pick up the new earbuds will also get a free three-month subscription to Apple Music. This news comes from an early unboxing video of the earbuds. The offer may be an apology from the tech company for having to delay the earbuds. The earbuds were originally going to come out months ago.Check out more recentApple RumorsorSubscribe to Apple Rumors:RSSThe postThursday Apple Rumors: iPhone 8 May Cost Over $1,000appeared first onInvestorPlace."
How Universal Display Corp. Gained 17% in January;2/9/2017;"What happenedShares ofUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED) rose 17.2% in January 2017,according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatThe big driver of Universal Display's January gains came from   Chinese electronics manufacturing giantFoxconn. The company publicly ""mulled"" a $7 billion investment in a   U.S.-based manufacturing facility, equipped to provideApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) with high-quality smartphone and tablet   screens.The U.S. factory plan dovetailed nicely with rumors that the   next few generations of Apple iPhones might ship with OLED   screens. Furthermore,Foxconn recently acquired screen maker Sharpfor a cool $5.1 billion, and that company had already dipped its   toes into OLED waters before joining the Foxconn mother ship.makeArticleAd();Put all the pieces together, and it starts to look as if Apple   and Foxconn might want to order quite a bit of OLED equipment and   materials in the reasonably near future. Universal Display shares   gained more than 12% in three days, based on this collection of   circumstantial evidence.Image source: Universal Display.Now whatThe American Foxconn factory is still an unconfirmed rumor,   and we certainly don't know for sure how Foxconn might use such a   facility. However, the volume of harmonizing rumors has   increased. This week, aReuters reportreaffirmed that Sharp is taking the lead on Foxconn's $7 billion   factory-building plans in America, citing unnamed insider   sources.So the Apple rumors remain neither confirmed nor debunked, but   the sheer weight of similar third-party reports is making the   whole thing sound plausible. And if that wasn't enough, Universal   Display just announced a $15 million investment to double   materials manufacturing partnerPPG's(NYSE: PPG) OLED emitter capacity over the next three   quarters.Next up, Universal Display is slated to report fourth-quarter   results on Feb. 23.10 stocks we like better than Universal DisplayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I write this,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock trades at about $824 per share. For 2017, analyst consensus estimates are that AMZN stock will earn $7.25 per share for the full year. That gives Amazon stock an astronomical forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 62x. In comparison, theS&P 500as a whole trades at about 17x next year's earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn other words, AMZN stock trades at a multiplenearly six timesthat of the average large-cap U.S. stock.Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon: For years, investors have considered Amazon stock overvalued based on a P/E ratio that has often been in the triple digits - and, not all that long ago, negative.Yet AMZN stock seems to defy gravity: Shares are up 50% over the past year, 110% over the past three years and a stunning 340% over the past five years. The reason is that Amazon isn't a stock that should be valued solely on next year's earnings, or the price investors are paying for those earnings. That's not because the market is crazy when it comes to AMZN stock and it's not because the fundamentals ""don't matter"". It's because Amazon is investing now for growth later - and that's exactly what itshouldbe doing.AMZN's Earnings Aren't the Only ThingIt's tempting to think that a stock with a lower P/E ratio is by definition ""cheaper"" than other stocks. Why would an investor pay 50x, or 100x, a year's earnings when he or she could pay 15x, or 10x? Growth certainly matters.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendIntuitively, an investor understands that 18x earnings for a bad business isn't obviously better than, say, 22x earnings for a good business. In fact, it may be worse. But the P/E ratio for Amazon stock seems ridiculous on its face. AMZN is already the biggest retailer in the world; is it really going to show so much growth that it's worth paying a 100x P/E? It would have to grow its profits by a factor of five just to get the multiple to 20x, which doesn't sound cheap itself.However, that type of analysis is generally too simplistic. A stock is valued based on the sum ofallits future cash flows - not just next year's. That's true for AMZN stock, and it's true forMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) stock as well.The fact that AMZN trades at 62x 2017 earnings and M trades at 10x doesn't, in and of itself, prove anything. It seems almost certain that the earnings and cash flow attributed to AMZN stock will continue to rise; it seems highly likely that Macy's earnings will, in contrast, fall. The rates at which those earnings rise or decline matters, of course, and those rates inform how investors value AMZN stock or M stock.But whether a stock is valued at 100x P/E or 3x P/E, investors need to take a long-term outlook. And while it may not appear like it at first glance, that's exactly what many AMZN stock holders are doing.The Two Ways For Amazon Stock to Grow EarningsEven those investors who are mostly bearish on Amazon stock would likely admit that Amazon's earnings will continue to grow going forward. But the bearish argument - one that has been made for the better part of a decade - is that it's almost impossible for AMZN earnings to growthat much. After all, as a company gets bigger, its growth rate fades, simply due to its size. (SeeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) for a perfect example.)At some point, the optimism that keeps Amazon stock at nosebleed levels will fade - and AMZN stock will come back to Earth.But that argument assumes that Amazon is at nosebleed levels, which may not be the case. The heavy-handed P/E ratio sounds highly stretched; however, according to AMZN's most recent 10-Q, it generated $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. That implies a sub-50x multiple to free cash flow ona trailing basis -a slightly less intimidating multiple. And the focus on P/E ratio also ignores that there are two ways for Amazon to grow earnings.The first is the standard way that companies grow earnings: higher sales and better margins. There's little reason, barring an economic recession, to see AMZN's sales declining. Even then, increased market share could allow Amazon to post revenue growth, if not at the 29% pace seen through the first three quarters of 2016.There's also reason to see AMZN's margins expand considerably. Somewhat incredibly, on a GAAP basis, Amazon's operating margin year-to-date is just 3.2%. Yet the company has built out an incredible distribution platform and it has invested billions of dollars in its Amazon Web Services business. Incremental sales thus should boost margins considerably; it takes very little in the way of investment to sell a few more items, or add another cloud customer.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingAMZN still has years of benefits from the scale it has built out, and those benefits will continue to expand margins for some time, allowing for steady, and even explosive earnings and cash flow growth.The second issue relative to current and 2017 earnings is that Amazon isn't currently maximizing its profits. Rather, it is spending - sometimes wildly - on a variety of initiatives, offering everything from restaurant delivery to photo printing to Prime Video and Prime Music subscriptions.Some of those efforts will work; many likely will fail. But looking at 2016 and 2017 earnings and not considering the impact of that spending is as short-term as buying AMZN stock in 2017 simply because it rose in 2016. Amazon's operating expenses are on pace to increase almost $10 billion year-over-year in 2016. A good chunk of that is coming from hiring employees, marketing the new businesses and creating the distribution platforms for various projects.Assume, then, that AMZN decided to focus on near-term earnings, instead of investing now for the future. Simply limiting that increase to $5 billion would come close todoublingAmazon's earnings and cash flow next year. Ignoring that new spend ignores the 'true' earnings power of AMZN stock.Bottom Line on AMZN Stock: It's ComplicatedThis is not to say that Amazon stock is necessarily a buy. As a value investor myself, I still question the valuation of AMZN stock in my own way. But simply checking the P/E ratio for AMZN - or any other stock - is too simplistic. Trying to value Amazon stock is a messy, difficult, detailed endeavor. The Amazon Web Services business is vastly different from the price-sensitive, low-margin, online retail business. It's not clear how much AMZN is spending on its new projects, and how much it could save.It's complicated. But so is investing the right way. And simply ignoring - or shorting - Amazon stock because of its P/E ratio isn't the right way to do it. There are reasons to be optimistic, and pessimistic, toward AMZN stock, but those reasons go well beyond a single number.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe postAmazon.com Inc.

A Win-Win Trade for Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Bulls;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is looking better and better both off and on the AAPL price chart. But following a massive rally, a well-positioned bull put spread trumps buying Apple stock near-term.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrIt has been almost exactly one month since I penned some bullish analysis on AAPL onJan. 10. At the time, there were plenty of potential headwinds for Apple stock. And to be honest, many of those factors, ranging from trade, to China, to a successful transition as asoftware company, could still present issues for Apple.Nevertheless, I didn't mind throwing caution to the wind given a dose of contrarianism, a decent Apple stock chart and firm control on risk using an April bull call spread. And I'm glad I did, as Apple stock has gone on to make its investors very happy and in more than one way.Back on Jan. 31, Apple managed to delight Wall Street by not only beating top- and bottom-line views, but also in the quality or tire-kicking aspect of the results. There were typical highlights, such as $18 billion in profits for the quarter, 78.3 million iPhones sold and a record cash hoard of $246 billion, whose size is simply amazing. But this report was also much more than that for Apple stock.The companyshowed a return to growthspearheaded by executing with its increasingly important Services business that includes the App Store, iCloud, iTunes and Apple Music.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowApple also dropped hints of a major media acquisition, expanding AAPL's reach into smart homes, and, somewhere in the dazzling dog-and-pony show, the buzz  over this year's forthcoming iPhone 8 iteration.Another way the company has made its investors very happy of late has been on the Apple stock chart.Apple Stock Weekly ChartA month ago, I discussed a bullish cup-and-handle pattern which had just cleared the 62% retracement level as Apple stock broke out on its daily price graph. The area is highlighted in yellow on the provided weekly stock chart of AAPL.Now, with shares up about 11% and focused on the larger time frame, a similar but more substantial corrective cup formation has emerged since Apple stock hit its all-time high in 2015.Looking forward, there's nothing to stop Apple stock from breaking out of the cup -pattern and essentially forgoing the development of a handle consolidation on the AAPL chart. But we're inclined to think that's not going to happen.In our view, an overbought stochastic and lack of an immediate catalyst for AAPL shares following a strong run will likely lead to a failed attempt at breaking out or simply a bit of price consolidation to neutralize conditions before a successful move into higher ground.AAPL Stock Bullish StrategyLooking at the Apple stock options board and given the discussed view, the Weeklys 3 March $129/$126 bull put spread is interesting.Priced for 50 cents, the seller of this put spread is able to collect the full credit as long as AAPL is above $129 at expiration three weeks from now. The margin of safety or downside buffer is roughly 2.3% with Apple stock trading near $132.05.If AAPL shares are above $129 at expiration, the collected credit amounts to a non-annualized return of 20%.In the event Apple stock falls and the vertical goes in-the-money, the trader can begin accumulating stock for no worse than a price of $128.50. Even better, the trader could possibly get a much lower effective purchase price if AAPL tanked through the spread.For instance, if AAPL were to fill the daily chart earnings gap and trade down to $121.50 in the next three weeks, through either assignment or closing the spread and simultaneously buying stock; the trader is at worst, out $2.50 or roughly 2% of Apple's share price.Ride the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE) Higher With This TradeFactoring in the loss, if this trader wished to buy AAPL on the extreme weakness, the initial purchase price would net out to $124 ($121.50 AAPL + $2.50 vertical loss). That compares favorably to a trader purchasing AAPL today for $132 and a position that would be out 8.5% on paper.Bottom line, with income potential and the opportunity to purchase Apple stock with a margin of safety that includes stronger value and limited risk, this bullish AAPL put spread makes for a solid alternative to simply buying shares right now.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

1 More Sign That Apple Inc.’s New MacBook Pro Computers Are a Huge Hit;2/9/2017;"Back in October of 2016,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) released much-needed refreshes of its MacBook Pro   product line. Thanks to the launch of these new systems, Apple   broke the long losing streak that its Mac business had been   seeing, andreported1.1% year-over-year Mac unit growth, as well as roughly 7% Mac   revenue growth in its most recent quarter, implying a boost in   Mac average selling prices.Although the numbers clearly speak for themselves, there's one   more bit of information that Apple disclosed on its most recent   earnings call that points to positive customer reception of the   company's new MacBook Pro systems.Apple's newest MacBook Pro. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Supply constraints curbed growthApple CEO Tim Cook said that that Apple was ""supply   constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December   quarter and is just now coming into supply/demand balance"" for   the systems.Additionally, CFO Luca Maestri offered some commentary about   the company's Mac channel inventory dynamics, saying that the   company ""ended the quarter at the low end of [Apple's] four to   five week target range for Mac channel inventory.""Apple sells many different Mac products besides the MacBook   Pro with Touch Bar -- including the older discounted MacBook Pro   models, MacBook Air, 12-inch MacBook, and iMac -- so even though   Apple apparently ended the quarter within its target channel   inventory range, channel inventory levels of the new MacBook Pro   systems may have been at lower levels.What's next for the Mac?Apple has a reasonable shot of continuing to outperform the   broader personal computer market again, especially if it gets   back to putting out new/refreshed systems at a regular pace.Next up, I expect Apple to refresh its desktop systems. The   ones that Apple currently has for sale are now a generation   behind in processor technology, so at the very least, the company   ought to offer models with the latest chips.The performance boost from the new chips won't be   earth-shattering -- generation-on-generation improvements in   personal-computer performance are hardly dramatic these days --   but it's easier to market systems with the latest processors than   it is to try to market ones with previous-generation processors,   especially when the competition has moved to the newer ones.I also expect Apple to refresh the 12-inch MacBook system   soon. The current models use older processors, so at the very   least, a processor upgrade is in order. Once again, this is not   the sort of thing that's going to be fundamentally game changing,   but a better, faster system should be easier to sell.After those systems are updated, I expect Apple to go back and   update the MacBook Pro lineup again. I don't expect significant   changes like the ones the company brought with the ones launched   back in October 2016, but improved processor technology, and   perhaps a larger battery, could make for a ""good enough""   upgrade.Apple doesn't need to deliver ""revolutionary"" Mac products to   the market to do reasonably well -- the company's brand power,   its reputation for excellent customer support, and perhaps even   the strength of macOS relative to Windows, to some potential   buyers should be enough to allow the company to at least perform   with the market, if not steadily gain share.However, as we saw in the last year, if Apple doesn't   regularly refresh its product line, keeping it stale in an   already muted personal-computer market, then there will be less   incentive for current Mac owners to upgrade, and it will become   harder to convince Windows users to switch over.For the sake of Apple's Mac business, let's hope that the   company has plans for annual product refreshes to keep things   interesting.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy       nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Made in partnership withLG, the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleHere's what you need to know.Google knows it didn't exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as thoughApple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas.That has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look.Android Wear 2.0 Key FeaturesGoogle was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided todelay it to this spring. Theofficial announcementlanded yesterday afternoon on GOOGL's blog.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendWhat did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.Key features Google is showing off include:Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit appLTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphoneGoogle Assistant is integratedCustomizable watch face componentsGoogle Play access direct from smartwatchSupport for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crownIn particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices - with no need to be connected to a smartwatch - means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.New Google Smartwatch Is From LGRumors had been flying that alongside the new operating system, the first Google smartwatch would make an appearance. That made sense considering GOOGL's push into branded hardware with the Google Pixel Phone and devices like Google Home and Google WiFi.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?However, the two new smartwatches unveiled as part of the announcement are from LG, in collaboration with GOOGL.The LG Watch Style is a relatively basic model. It lacks advanced capabilities like GPS (or even a heart rate monitor), but delivers smartwatch features in a slim, traditional wristwatch form factor. The round display is a 1.2-inch OLED screen at 360 x 360 pixel resolution and the watch has all-day battery life. It comes with a leather strap and for an extra $30, a Rose Gold color option.The LG Watch Style is the bigger and more capable device, fully able to take full advantage of all Android Wear 2.0's new features. The 1.38-inch P-OLED display has a crisp 480 x 480 pixel resolution. The round frame is stainless steel, with IP68 water resistance. There's a heart rate monitor and GPS for fitness, Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE and NFC for Android Pay. Battery life is rated for all-day, but use of features like LTE and the heart rate monitor can significantly cut that.They're premium devices, designed to take on the Apple Watch and GOOGL's involvement means they make the most of Android Wear 2.0. But they aren't the official Google smartwatch … well see if that comes later.Availability and PricingGoogle says Android Wear 2.0 will begin rolling out ""in the coming weeks."" Most current Android Wear smartwatches should be eligible for the free update, but not all watches will support all features. The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will retail for $249 and $349 respectively and will go on sale in the U.S. starting Feb. 10.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Target Was Upped Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) stock enjoyed healthy gains in the days following the company's earnings reports, and analystscrooned over the results.makeArticleAd();But not everyone was so thrilled, with some pointing out the fact that the December quarter had an extra week and others focusing on the challenges being seen in the smartphone market.Nonetheless, analysts are as happy as can be and continue to try to sell investors on the iPhone 8 cycle. At least one analyst has boosted his price target for AAPL stock based on the record iPhone unit number in the December quarter.AAPL Stock Target: $154 Per ShareCanaccord Genuityanalyst T. Michael Walkley raised his price target for Apple stock by more than $10 per share, from $142 to $154 per share in a research note dated Feb. 6. He feels the company took a ""strong share"" of the premium end of the world's smartphone market during the December quarter, as it generated 92% of profits.That is a decline from 106% of the profits in the September quarter, however, becauseSAMSUNG ELECTRONIC's (SSNLF) profits improved after the Galaxy Note 7 recall.Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones with an average selling price of $695 during its first fiscal quarter as consumers preferred the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus models. Walkley also believes the iPhone maker benefited from the Note 7 recall-although there was some debate about that before the results were released. Apple management said the quarter had the highest quarterly number of switchers from Android, something that third-party data indicated just before the release.The analyst also expects the iPhone 7 lineup to continue doing well, bridging the gap until the iPhone 8 is released, probably in September.Despite Walkley's (and almost everyone else's) enthusiasm about Apple stock, Neil George, a contributor forThe Street,feels investors are doing nothing more but attending the ""church of Apple.""Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200InvestorsdumpedAmazon.con, Inc.(AMZN) stock immediately following the retailer's earnings results (although the shares are up today), but they have been happily slurping up Apple stock.He said the iPhone maker ""is faced with a dwindling market share and shrinking margins,"" which means it just doesn't make sense to be so enamored with the company.Meanwhile, Amazon recorded soaring revenues and the seventh consecutive profitable quarter. There's also new data from Slice Intelligence indicating that the company hoards 53% of all growth in U.S. online sales.Did Apple Take Investors For a Ride?George argues that Apple ""pulled off a sleight of hand"" by adding the extra week in the December quarter-an argument also made by Thomas H. Kee Jr. onMarketWatch. According to Kee, to make up for that extra week, the company would have had to report about $3.53 per share in earnings rather than the $3.38 per share it reported.He also estimates that revenue should have been about $81 billion rather than the $78.4 billion that was reported. Based on his weekly calculations, the company grew at a 4.11% slower rate in the most recent December quarter than it did in the same quarter in 2015. Kee argued that Apple's growth rate contracted rather than grew in the most recently completed quarter and that it only looks like it did because of that extra week.George highlighted other ""problems"" he sees at Apple as well, like the contracted gross margin, which fell to 38.5% from 40.1% in the year-ago period. The iPhone maker also saw its sales in China, the world's biggest market, fall 12% in the December quarter, reducing its market share there to 9.6%. He said the company's global market share has fallen as well, down to 11.5%.Apple  is widely expected to launch the tenth anniversary edition of its smartphone under the iPhone 8 moniker, and most firms have been calling this cycle a ""supercycle"" because they're expecting tremendous growth.However, one analyst that's been calling for a supercycle is starting to back off from that theory and suggests now that the next cycle will be one of ""smooth"" growth rather than anything of the ""super"" variety.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialUBSanalyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note dated Feb. 7 that he's now ""smoothing"" out his assumptions for iPhone growth over the next couple of years and adopting ""less of asupercycleview"" for fiscal 2018."" He noted that it should be expected for product cycles in a maturing market to become muted, so he's cutting his iPhone unit growth estimate from 16% to 12% for fiscal 2018 and boosting his fiscal 2019 estimate from a 2% decline to a 7% increase.Despite this smoothing out, he's still expecting the iPhone 8 cycle to bring greater growth than the fiscal 2019 cycle.He feels that it could be more beneficial for Apple stock's multiple if the company experiences more gradual growth because investors might be encouraged to see the company's hardware and services revenue combined as an annuity.Shares of AAPLstock rose by as much as 0.19% to $131.78 during regular trading hours on Wednesday and are trading slightly higher in early morning trading Thursday.The postApple Inc.

Apple’s Earnings Beat Was Driven By Broad-Based Execution;2/9/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  strong earnings beat on January 31 was   driven by strong performance across numerous business segments.   In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA discuss the   headline numbers and other areas where the company executed   well.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:I doubt that you could possibly be doing as well as Apple is   doing this week, though.Evan Niu:[laughs] That's true.Lewis:It's not too often that you see the world's largest   company spike 6% after earnings.Niu:Yeah. The numbers they put up, I mean, I was   pretty impressed. I wasn't really expecting them to blow it out   like this, and beat their own guidance by $400 million.Lewis:Yeah. We always do the Apple earnings show, it's one   of my favorites to do. But after several in a row where we've   been, like, ""Yeah, we know that growth is slow or even   declining, but just be patient, we think it's going to be   OK,"" it will be nice to do a show where we can talk   about them and have a bit of a rosier outlook on things,   and maybe reaffirm some of the confidence that the   Street should have in the business. In a lot of   ways, it's still a fantastic company. Why don't we start out   with a big numbers here? Revenue came in at $78.3 billion,   which beat estimates of $77.3 billion. Also beat the company's   guidance, like you said, by a couple hundred million.   Earnings per share came in at $3.36 for the quarter,   which also beat estimates of $3.22. So, for the first time   since fiscal Q1 of last year, the company posted   year-over-year revenue growth.Niu:Yeah. I think that's one of the big stories. 2016 was   so tough on them in terms of storylines and sentiment,   because, yeah, first year ever of showing negative growth,   and everyone is kind of gloomy about it. Then, they come   back and say, ""We still have it in us, we can still set   records, we can still push all these different parts of the   business to these completely record levels,"" including the   Mac, which is crazy, because the Mac has been around for 40   years, and they're still continuing to grow it and push up   higher.Lewis:And they've been working against so many   headwinds for such a long time in that year. You look   at the strong dollar having a pretty sizable impact on the   money they make overseas, and also the selling price of   devices overseas. You look at the elongating of the upgrade   cycle, particularly with some of the wireless   carriers moving away from a subsidy model, and getting   people off of that two-year upgrade.So, there are just a lot of things pushing against what   would normally cause people to be buying phones, or would   be allowing them to recognize more in revenue and earnings   here in the U.S. So, it's nice to see them bring it back up   this quarter.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChip firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to release its fourth-quarter and full-year results to the investment community after the bell on Thursday, Feb. 9. In full disclosure, I've been slow to warm to Nvidia's investment appeal, and in the meantime, NVDA stock has nearly tripled.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe key to the forthcoming earnings release will be growth - just like it is for any company. So far, the earnings momentum and increases in analyst projections suggest Nvidia's prospects are bright.But will NVDA stock holders have to tolerate some bumps along the way?Nvidia Earnings ExpectationsIn mylast updateon Nvidia in early December, I suggested keeping an eye on earnings trends. At that time, full-year earnings estimates (the average of the earnings all analysts covering the name expect the company to report) had jumped nearly 32% - from $1.84 to $2.42 per share. It's a key reason NVDA stock has rallied so strongly.The current full-year estimate for Nvidia earnings (according to Yahoo Finance) is $2.41 per share. It relays that 19 analysts have provided estimates. That's about flat over the past 60 days, but actually down slightly from the $2.45 projected 30 days ago.But really, this is splitting hairs. It's very likely NVDA reports a solid quarter in terms of bottom-line growth.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowAnd sales growth is projected to bestellar. Analysts expect at least a 36% annual bump to $6.84 billion. Next year, top-line growth is projected to slow to 16% for full-year sales of nearly $8 billion; 2018 profits are currently pegged at $2.71 per share.The Business Case for NVDA StockWith a current share price of $117.40, the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock sits right below 50. That's a rather lofty multiple, and it essentially means that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickly surging share price could take a similarly speedy tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia operates in some of the most exciting growth areas for semiconductors. The company is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular its graphic processing units, or GPUs. The company boasts it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. This looks accurate - a recentBarron'sarticlepegged its GPU market share at 68%. This is one of the most compelling spaces in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia's chips are an integral component in the ecosystems that are pioneering growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machine learning, and self-driving cars. These are some hugely disruptive industries that could end up revolutionizing many facets of the gaming, computing, and automotive industries.The company's gaming business is the largest operating unit and growing 30% per year on average since 2013. Its data center business (to support cloud computing) is expanding at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automotive is skyrocketing 75% annually, though from a very small initial base.In some respects, and provided you are comfortable with the lofty valuation, Nvidia is a very compelling way for broad exposure to multiple disruptive industries.NVDA adds exposure to the cloud-computing excitement that is creating a buzz at giant tech firms includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole position in the autonomous automobile charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 computing platform currently powers the Tesla auto models that already have self-driving capabilities.The CompetitionMore direct competitors includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are looking to grow in these newer markets. Both key rivals are also likely to benefit from GPUs used to power gaming systems, machine learning, and servers used for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from its dominant market share in personal computing. Its 80% market share to power personal computers and related devices has literally resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in cash flow over the past several decades. This gives it unmatched rivalry to invest in new technology and keep a leadership position over chip competitors. But computing is mature and barely expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost its way. Years of mismanagement allowed Intel to expand on its dominance and nearly put AMD out of business. But new management appears to have reinvigorated AMD, and investors are starting to believe it can also benefit from the same markets Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arecent interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni pegged semiconductor stocks as one of his favorite industries for 2017. In his words, ""we're talking about major secular disruptions in autos, consumer electronics, and gaming."" Chips that power data warehouses to serve the rise in cloud computing represent yet another market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor's best bet to gain exposure to these markets. The rub, of course, is its valuation already reflects many more years of rapid growth.AMD is an interesting turnaround play, though with its current low levels of profitability, the trading multiples are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. Its forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest taking a wait-and-see approach to Nvidia earnings. The fourth quarter is likely to impress, but given the lofty valuation, any hiccup in the expectations could result in a fair amount of share price volatility.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGo Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock For FreeReport: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEveryone knows thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is looking to leverage the 10th anniversary of the iPhone to boost sales. The smartphone market is maturing, and last quarter's record iPhone numbers were the first positive news in a while. For 2017, the company wants its new iPhone to make a huge splash and have people camping outside its stores waiting for one.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut no matter how cool AAPL makes the iPhone 8, would people pay $1,000 or more for one?iPhone 8 RumorsOver the past several months, rumors have been building that AAPL is going all-out with the iPhone 8. After three years of looking essentially identical - good luck telling an iPhone 6 from an iPhone 7 without actually powering it up - the iPhone 8 is going to look different.Justhowdifferent is where the rumor mill comes in.However, the money is on Apple dropping the aluminum back in favor of anall-glass design. Making the new iPhone pop even more is the expectation of an OLED display that ditches the bezels and even the Home button.A new iPhone that looks completely different from the models of the previous three years is expected to boost sales as Apple fans trade in their old phones. There also has been speculation that AAPL will take advantage of the 10th anniversary to charge a premium for the iPhone 8.But a new report suggests that could be higher than expected.Is the Market Ready for a $1,000-Plus iPhone?Fast Companyreports that AAPL isn't just looking to boost sales with the iPhone 8,it's looking to cash in on upgrade fever.The 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansCiting a source with ""knowledge of Apple's plans,""Fast Companysays the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will indeed be the all-glass design (with a stainless steel band) and OLED display. At 5.8 inches, it will be larger than the iPhone 7 Plus. It may even have a cooler name than iPhone 8: ""iPhone X"" is being thrown around.And according toFast Company'ssource,it will likely start at over $1,000.In comparison, previous iPhones have traditionally had a $649 starting price. When the Plus models were introduced, AAPL started those bigger iPhones at $749, boosting that to $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.Can Apple Pull Off Such an Expensive iPhone 8?There's no question that $1,000-plus is averyexpensive smartphone. That's basically $250 more than AAPL has ever charged.EvenSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) only hit $849 with its flagship (and doomed) Galaxy Note 7. That phablet has a great deal in common with the iPhone 8's expected features, including an oversized OLED display and wireless charging.However, Apple is undoubtedly emboldened by the success of its more expensive Plus phone in the last quarter. Despite carrying a premium (and the iPhone 7 Plus price hike), in the previous quarter, sales surged for the larger, more expensive iPhones. The iPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for40% of iPhone 7 sales worldwide- double the share of the iPhone 6 Plus.Fast Company'ssource says Apple will also offer the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in 2017. That positions the iPhone 8 - or iPhone X - as a true premium offering. Anyone who wants a new iPhone would still have the option of buying the standard offerings (which would continue to be among the best smartphones on the market).Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3But for those with deeper pockets who truly want to make a statement, then the $1,000-plus 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will be there.It's a risky strategy, but it could pay off big-time for Apple.As usual, this early in the year, speculation about AAPL's new iPhone plans is just that - speculation. So stay tuned as more details leak and we get a closer to a definitive picture of what the company is up to for fall 2017.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

(AMD);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are headed higher this morning, as Wall Street weights its options ahead of the latest round of corporate earnings and a smattering of economic data. Among today's earnings headliners areTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR),The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), while weekly jobless claims and wholesale inventories round out the economic reports.makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.16%, withS&P 500futures rising 0.16% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.1%.On the options front, volume surged to well above average on Wednesday, driven mostly byApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call traders looking to capture roughly $3.1 billion in dividends. Overall, about 16.9 million calls and 12.7 million puts changed hands yesterday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio slipped to 0.69, though the 10-day moving average ticked higher once again to yet another three-month high at 0.71.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders, Apple call traders scrambled to get a chunk of the roughly $3.1 billion in dividends the company will be paying out on Feb. 16, to  those who were shareholders as of yesterday. Meanwhile,Gilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) retreated on mixed options volume as guidance for its hepatitis C treatment was lower than expected, andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) was bolstered by supportive comments from BMO Capital.Apple Inc. (AAPL)In a frenzy that pushed Wednesday's total overall options volume well above the daily average, Apple call traders flooded the stock with in-the-money Feb contracts. Total volume rocketed to a near-term high of more than 4.2 million contracts, with calls gobbling up 88% of the day's take.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe most popular strikes were the Feb $125 and Feb $120 calls, whereTrade-Alert.comnotes that a plethora of 12,000 and 13,500 contract blocks traded late in yesterday's session.For traders who managed to gain control of AAPL stock shares by the close last night,Apple is paying out 57 cents per share on Feb. 16- for a rough total of about $3.1 billion to all shareholders of record.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)Bright and early yesterday morning,Gilead posted a fourth-quarter profitof $2.70 per share on revenue of $3.1 billion. While both figures were down year-over-year, Gilead managed to beat Wall Street's expectations for the quarter. Guidance, however, was another matter.It seems that Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drug was considerably more effective than expected, all but curing the disease and lowering expectations for sales in 2017. Going forward, Gilead expects to sell between $7.5 billion and $9 billion worth of hep-C treatments, far below Wall Street's expectations for $12 billion.Options traders were torn on GILD stock's reaction. Volume tagged over 554,000 contracts, with calls eking out 53% of the day's take. Still, with GILD plunging more than 8.6% yesterday, the shares are now trading well below all major call accumulations in the Feb series, while the roughly 19,000 puts at the Feb $70 strike are trading nearly four-points in the money.With GILD at its lowest point since 2014, some of yesterday's call action may have been bargain hunting in a bid for an oversold bounce for the shares.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)WhenBMO Capital commented on PC and laptop salesfor January and February, it wasn't exactly the most bullish of outlooks. Sales were slightly lower than expected in January and February's outlook was similar, with the Chinese New Year affecting demand. However, BMO said that its ""outperform"" rating for AMD wouldn't be affected, and the uptick in demand following the Chinese New Year may actually help AMD.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3With the shares riding high following rumors of anIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC)licensing deal, it was all the nudge AMD bulls needed to double down on call options. Volume on Wednesday remained strong at 355,000 contracts, while calls snapped up 70% of the day's take.AMD is now trading well north of most major call accumulations in the Feb series, with only the roughly 8,000 contracts at the $14 strike remaining in its way. Meanwhile, most options traders have narrowed their focus to the Feb $13.50 strike, especially put traders, with about 10,000 of these bearish bets now residing at the strike.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Apple, Inc.'s Stock's 40% Comeback -- What Investors Should Know;2/9/2017;"Over the past 12 months,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has absolutely trounced the S&P 500,   surging 40.4%, from just under $95 per share to about $132 at the   time of this writing. This rise compares with the S&P 500's   22% gain during the same period. Interestingly, the performance   of Apple's business during this period hasn't been particularly   impressive. So, what drove the stock higher?Boring resultsIn Apple's most recently reported trailing-12-month period,   results actually look quite dismal. During this period, revenue   fell 7% and earnings per share tumbled an even steeper 11.3%. YetApple stocksurged higher.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Sure, Apple's financial results have turned upward recently,   with the tech giant reporting 3.3% and 9.6% year-over-year   increases in revenue and EPS for the company's most recently   reported quarter. But this is just one quarter. Further, these   aren't the sort of results often associated with 40% rises in a   stock price -- especially when referring to a popular tech   company.But despite Apple's lackluster performance in the past 12   months, shares have climbed higher and easily outperformed the   market.Valuation mattersSo if Apple's business saw both revenue and EPS decline in the   past 12 reported months, why are shares trading higher? While   investors could come up with a range of reasons, one catalyst for   the stock during this period likely stands out the most: Apple   stock was undervalued.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYChartsOne year ago, Apple stock had a mind-boggling low   price-to-earnings ratio of just 10. For context, the average P/E   of stocks in the S&P 500 at the time was 21.4, more than   double Apple's. Combining this dirt-cheap valuation with Apple's   dividend, its sizable repurchase program, and the company's long   history of successful products, itwas clearthat the Street had oversold Apple stock as the market worried   about the company's ability to continue growing its business.Sure, Apple's stock probably didn't justify the same 20 P/E   its peers in the S&P 500 averaged, but the stockalmost certainlydidn'tdeserveto trade at a P/E of 10.What's next for Apple stock?Going forward, can Apple stock continue soaring? While Apple's   higher price-to-earnings ratio today of nearly 16 does a better   job of pricing in a more optimistic outlook for the company,   investors should keep in mind that the stock's 40% rise during   the past 12 months doesn't automatically make Apple stock   expensive today. Indeed, the stock is arguably still a buy.For Apple to live up to its valuation today, the company will   need to return to more consistent revenue growth and maintain   pricing power -- two outcomes that shouldn't be a problem for the   company. Yes, revenue and EPS are down in the trailing 12 months,   but Apple'sreturn to growthrecently, it'sfast-growing services segment, andconsistently strong pricing power, all point to a bright future for Apple's business -- and a   bright future for the underlying business when a stock is trading   at just 16 times earnings likely means the stock will perform   well, too.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Large Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) Hits New 52-Week High;2/9/2017;"For investors seeking momentum,Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETFSCHGis probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up roughly 28.6% from its 52-week low price of $45.45/share.makeArticleAd();But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let's take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:SCHG in FocusSCHG provides exposure to the growth stocks of the large cap segment with key holdings in information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare and industrials. However, it has a significant concentration on the top firm - AppleAAPL- at 6.9% while other firms hold less than 3.2% of assets. The product charges 4 basis points in fees (see:all the Large Cap ETFs here).Why the Move?The growth space of the broad U.S. stock market has been an area to watch lately given the stellar performance of the stocks and improving domestic fundamentals. Though Trump's protectionist and anti-trade policies are flaring up volatility, U.S. bourses are hitting new highs. In such a trending market (i.e. a market characterized by a prolonged uptrend), growth stocks tend to outperform. Additionally, solid manufacturing and industrial activities across the globe are providing a boost to these stocks.More Gains Ahead?Currently, SCHG has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with a Medium risk outlook. Therefore, it is hard to get a handle on its future returns in one way or the other. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank, so there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why the Stock Market Under Trump Will Probably Lag the Market Under Obama;2/9/2017;"President Donald Trump's @POTUS Twitter feed sounded off in   celebration on Jan. 25 when theDow Jones Industrial Averagereached 20,000 for the first time ever, just five days   after his inauguration:Great!#Dow20Khttps://t.co/wXFhXBLgag-- President Trump (@POTUS)January 25, 2017In her own Tweet, former campaign manager and now presidential   advisor Kellyanne Conway credited ""The Trump Effect.""makeArticleAd();The administration was right to celebrate what has been a very   bullish market rally following the election results on Nov. 8.   The market reacted bearishly to the unexpected results on   election night, but ever since then, it's been on the rise.However, the Dow's 9%-plus rise since Election Day is just a   fraction of how much the stock market rose during President   Obama's eight-year tenure. It's very early in the Trump   administration, but can we predict whether the market will   perform better or worse under President Trump than under   President Obama?Image source: Getty Images.Timing mattersThe chart below shows how theDow Jones Industrial Averagehas performed during the terms of the last 10 presidents, all the   way back to when Lyndon Johnson took office in 1963 (the black   arrows mark the year in which each president was first   elected):Image source: MacroTrends.net, with presidents' names tied     to election dates added by author.

Data source:MacroTrends.net.Obama took office at the tail end of the Financial Crisis.   Even though the administration enacted policies that would   typically seem to limit the earnings ability of some corporations   within the Dow, such as stricter reporting regulations, the   market rose handily (in percentage terms) during his eight years   in office. Setting aside any economic policies the Obama   administration enacted, the fact that President Obama took office   near the market's trough meant that the market, which is cyclical   in nature, had a much stronger chance of rebounding during his   tenure.Meanwhile, Trump assumed the presidency after an   eight-year-long bull run that saw no sustained corrections.   History shows that corrections happen at somewhat regular   intervals, and many market analysts believe one is due soon.   Based on how market the cycle has worked through recent decades,   it seems unlikely that we'll see consistent growth during   President Trump's tenure -- but, of course, it's not   impossible.What business leaders are sayingMany business leaders have been speaking optimistically of   Trump's proposed financial policies in their earnings calls.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins said during the company's fiscal   first-quarter earnings call in November, ""I think President-elect   Trump appears to be very business-oriented and is very focused on   driving the U.S. economy, and anytime the U.S. economy improves   that's certainly good for us.""Southwest Airlines(NYSE: LUV) is another company that is looking forward to lower   taxes and less regulation. In the most recent earnings call, CEO   Gary Kelly finished answering an analyst question about upcoming   policy changes by saying:""We've looked at the tax reform proposals and we're quite     excited about that on the corporate front, but that's just     about income tax. So that doesn't really speak to the very     heavy burden that we have for aviation taxes, which we also     want to take up with the administration. So, that's a long     answer to your question and I think the bottom line is: No, we     don't know anything specific yet, but we sure like what we're     hearing so far.""Of course, there's also rising concern among many CEOs and   other business leaders about how certain policies that have been   floated or initiated could negatively affect their businesses or   the broader economy. These include tariffs on imported goods and   the controversial executive order restricting travel to the   U.S.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) management has said positive things about   potential tax cuts, especially those related to repatriating cash   kept overseas, of which Apple has around $200 billion. However,   Apple is also one of the biggest companies that in recent weeks   have come out against Trump's immigration policy. And it is one   of many companies taking legal action against Trump's immigration   stance, citing (along with moral opposition) concerns that it   could ultimately damage the company financially.How to invest during a Trump presidencyThe Dow Jones' average price-to-earnings ratio is currently   around 20 -- relatively high by historic standards. Additionally,   you can probably expect politics, and the market's reaction to   them, to be volatile in the months and years ahead. Nonetheless,   that shouldn't scare away investors. As the investing proverb   goes: Time in the market is more important than timing the   market.Regardless of how you believe the stock market will perform   based on cyclicalty or political volatility -- barring a massive   shift in policy that derails corporate earnings ability, or a   major economic disaster resulting from an environmental, social,   or defense crisis -- you should note that the market performance   graph above has marched upward over the long term.As a long-term investor, you should continue to look for   valuable investments to buy and hold while also watching the   economic and political climate closely. And whatever you do,   remember that your investment horizon should be greater than four   -- or even eight -- years.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Boeing Co (BA) Stock Gives Savvy Investors a Good Payout;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDon't let a faulty altimeter lead you to believeBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) is in need of repair. Any stray measurements in Boeing stock's share price on Wednesday were tied to a pending dividend payment - and one that has already paid nice dividends to some options traders. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrShares of Boeing have been flying high in 2017 after hitting record highs following the aircraft manufacturer's earnings beat late last month. But in Wednesday's session, BA stock may have appeared to have had a slight crack in its fuselage; pardon the pun.Houston, Boeing Has a Problem?At a share price of $164.08 and depending on your trading vendor, BA stock was off either $1 or 0.61% or a more eyebrow raising -$2.42 or -1.45%.The $1.42 difference between the two readings in Boeing shares is tied to the stock going ex-dividend Wednesday, with a cash payment of $1.42 scheduled for March 3.Bearing this in mind, trade vendors who recognize the ex-date will show BA stock as trading lower by the less-significant 0.61%. Any chart or quote platforms that erroneously fail to account for the ex-date will indicate Boeing has declined by a larger 1.45%.For BA stock investors who were long or purchased shares by Tuesday's close, Wednesday's minor damage is reflected by the more modest 0.61% dip, as $1.42 will be paid back to shareholders next month to dampen the otherwise larger 1.45% decline in Boeing.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterWhat's the point? Dividends aren't a free lunch, as the money distributed is taken out of the share price of the stock. If Wednesday wasn't an ex-date in Boeing, BA stock would be trading $1.42 higher at $165.50 vs. $164.08 - bottom-line.For the proverbial free lunch, you'd have to look at Tuesday's heavy volume options trading in BA stock tied to 'dividend play' activity, which looks to arbitrage the future payout with an immediate overnight payoff.BA Stock Dividend Play StrategyTo illustrate how this might be accomplished, we can look at the BA stock Feb $155 call, as roughly $14,200 in profits was distributed to one or more options traders today due to the ex-dividend.In Tuesday's session, more than 5,600 of the deep in-the-money calls traded. The heavy tally compares to open interest at the time of roughly 2,500. With the February $155 put trading for 10 cents, part of the unusual volume may have been in the form of traders executing buy-writes or the equivalent of a synthetic short put.But the traders responsible for this activity weren't looking to establish buy-writes for 10 cents when buying BA stock and selling the February $155 call during Tuesday's session. Nope.What these BA stock dividend traders were really after was hoping a long $155 call holder within the pool of existing open interest of 2,500 failed to exercise the contract last night. If that were to occur, those traders would in effect, have shorted (synthetically) the February $155 put worth a measly 10 cents for a much more meaningful $1.42 for each buy-write still in inventory.How it works is Tuesday's dividend play traders would effectively wash on their BA stock position as the decline in share price attributed to the ex-date will be paid next month. The profit generator in this transaction is the short call portion of the buy-write, which wasn't assigned.Call options don't receive dividends, so a contract like the deep $155 call essentially loses the full value of the pending dividend. It's why an investor holding this contract would be greatly motivated to exercise the call and convert the position into BA stock before the ex-dividend.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in ChinaAs it stands, of the 2,500 in open interest roughly 2,400 call holders did elect to exercise their call into BA stock last night in order to receive the upcoming dividend. We know this based on Wednesday's open interest just shy of 100 contracts.We also know that because of the failure of those contracts to convert, one or more traders short the call - and maybe part of a buy-write positioning described; already profited to the collective tune of around $14,200.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) may be great to improve your health, but as for Fitbit stock, it has been lethal for investors. During the last 12 months, FIT stock is off a horrendous 60%. This is certainly another case study of how high-profile IPOs can quickly come undone.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitBut what about the future? Is there hope for Fitbit stock? Might there be a value play here?As I've written various times for InvestorPlace, it's probably not a good idea to be hopeful. For example, FIT is a company that develops a product that really is not a must-have. According to a recent study fromGartner, the abandonment rate on fitness trackers is 30%. The most common reasons for this include: users either get bored or the device breaks!The conclusion from the report: ""Dropout from device usage is a serious problem for the industry. The abandonment rate is quite high relative to the usage rate. To offer a compelling enough value proposition, the uses for wearable devices need to be distinct from what smartphones typically provide. Wearables makers need to engage users with incentives and gamification.""The Other Problems for FIT StockBut this is definitely not the only major issue with Fitbit stock. Let's face it, the competitive environment remains intense. The company must fight against tough rivals likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Although, the biggest threat isApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch, which is still in the early phases.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterIn light of all this, is it any wonder that Wall Street is concerned with FIT stock? Of course not.More importantly, the company is already reporting major problems, as seen with the latest warning on fourth-quarter earnings. Fitbit's guidance calls for a loss of 51 cents to 56 cents a share on revenues of $572 million to $580 million. By comparison, the prior forecast was for earnings of 14 cents to 18 cents a share and revenues of $725 million to $750 million. Overall, it looks like the holiday season turned out to be a disaster for the company.Unfortunately, the bad situation isexpected to continue. The full-year prediction is for revenues of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and a loss of 22 cents to 44 cents a share on FIT stock. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for a much more robust $2.38 billion on the top-line and profits of 64 cents a share.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockTo deal with the challenges, FIT has a plan that looks weak. The company expects to reduce the workforce by mere 6% and to take other vague efforts to reduce operating costs, leverage data and launch products into new categories. Interesting enough, Fitbit wants to focus more on the smartwatch market, but this will likely mean more expenses.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingEven worse, CEO James Parksaidthat the issues with the company were ""temporary"" and the ""performance is not reflective of the value of our brand, market-leading platform, and company's long-term potential.""Huh? Well, this really does seem like the talk of someone who is out-of-touch. And this should definitely be ominous for holders of FIT stock.Granted, perhaps there may be a buyout. But when it comes to broken hardware companies, this may be wishful thinking. For example, think about how long the rumors for a purchase of the beleagueredBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) have existed.For the most part, Fitbit stock may not be very interesting to a suitor. And this is not because the products are sub-par. Instead, it could be as simple as that the market has hit maturation levels and that big players like AAPL stand to capture a big part of what's available.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Facebook vs. Apple: Whose Reality Will Win?;2/8/2017;"One of the most promising trends on the horizon that has   arguably the most transformative potential is virtual/augmented   reality (VR/AR). How these technologies emerge and subsequently   affect our lives remains to be seen, but companies are already   placing their bets accordingly.Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) became the poster child for VR in one fell swoop in   2014 when it scooped up Oculus for $2 billion. A week ago,   Facebook lost a lawsuit regarding the acquisition to ZeniMax,   which alleged that Oculus stole trade secrets, and a jury awarded   ZeniMax $500 million (ZeniMax was seeking $6 billion). Facebook   will appeal, but let's call the total effective cost of   acquisition $2.5 billion for now.Once upon a time,Alphabetwas the poster child for AR with Google Glass, but that product   failed spectacularly.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has emerged as a potential candidate to assume   that title, albeit unofficially until it actually unveils an AR   offering. We do know that CEO Tim Cook isfar more interestedin AR than VR, believing that it will have broader appeal with   mainstream use cases.makeArticleAd();It's still early innings, but whose vision of reality will   win?VR is harder and will take longerFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg firmly believes that VR will be   the next major computing platform that has the potential to be a   paradigm shift. But it's going to take an awful long time to get   there. VR is currently a nascent niche of video gaming, and it   requires creating entire worlds to immerse users in. That also   requires both a lot of software development as well as heavy   lifting on the technical side, requiring high-end gaming rigs   that cost $1,000 or more by themselves.Mark Zuckerberg speaking at Oculus Connect 2. Image source:     Facebook.His Zuckness sees VR as a richer media format that can create   a diverse array of social experiences. He's even envisioned a   distant future where you can visit a doctor in VR, or hang out   with long-distance friends in a VR room (like how hechatted with Hugo Barrabefore hiring the executive). It will take at least a decade, but   Facebook is in it for the long haul. Uncle Zuck is also   interested in AR, but it seems that he thinks AR will come after   VR, based on his comments from last year's F8 conference:Over the next 10 years, the form factor's just going to keep     on getting smaller and smaller. And eventually we're going to     have what looks like normal-looking glasses that can do both     virtual and augmented reality. And augmented reality gives you     the ability to see the world but also to be able to overlay     digital objects on top of that.Earlier today,Business Insiderreported that Facebook was shutting down hundreds of its Oculus   pop-up demonstration stations within big box retailers, noting   that employees would go days without giving a single   demonstration to interested customers. So yeah, it's going to be   a while until VR is ready for the mainstream.AR is easier and be here soonerAs usual, Apple isn't giving any official clues as to its   strategy, but there have been rumors of the company testing out   AR glasses and it has been hiring and acqui-hiring experts from   the field since at least 2015.It's much more plausible that AR will have a more immediate   impact. The software should be easier to develop and less   computationally intensive. Imagine the things you currently do on   your smartphone being beamed in front of you. Or you can even use   a smartphone as an AR interface, which many apps already do   today.But if Apple were to jump in directly with AR integration in   iOS and/or a set of AR glasses, that would have the potential to   truly bring AR to the masses, much like the company's track   record with bringing many other previously niche technologies to   the mainstream. It's also a lot more approachable to the   average user.Here's another quote from Cook regarding AR from   September:My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the     two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for     both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other,     but also have other things visually for both of us to see.     Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone     else here that is not here, present, but could be made to     appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool     things there.Cook's point is that VR can be isolating since you have to   wear a large obtrusive headset, which is a bit ironic given that   Facebook is so interested in a potentially anti-social experience   (at least anti-social in physical reality).I'm going to side with Apple here and agree that AR has much   more potential than VR.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. IBM;2/8/2017;"Shares ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andInternational Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) have performed well over the past year, both up about   40% following periods of underperformance. Apple, after reporting   three consecutive quarters of sales declines, finally broke out   of its funk last month when it reported solid,albeit muddled, holiday quarter results. IBM, after years of earnings declines,   expects to return to growth on a per-share basis this year.Both stocks are cheap relative to earnings, but I think IBM is   the better buy. Here's why.Apple is cheap, but growth will be toughShares of Apple trade around their all-time high following the   company's fiscal first-quarter report, but the stock is still   cheap relative to earnings. Apple produced $45.2 billion of net   income over the past 12 months, or $8.39 per share. With a stock   price around $131, that puts Apple's PE ratio at roughly   15.6.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.But this calculation ignores the immense amount of cash on   Apple's balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, Apple had   $246 billion of cash and investments and $77 billion of debt,   leaving a net cash position of $169 billion. Valued fully and   backed out, Apple's cash-adjusted PE ratio falls to just   11.5.Apple stockisn't nearly as cheap as it was a year ago, but the market is   still pricing in minimal future growth even at all-time highs.   There are good reasons for this. Apple remains highly dependent   on the iPhone, which accounted for nearly 70% of revenue during   the first quarter. With the smartphone market no longer growing   quickly, consumers taking longer to upgrade, and mid-range   devices getting better and cheaper, consistent iPhone growth   going forward is going to be tough to achieve.And even though Apple managed to grow iPhone sales and EPS   during the first quarter, net income declined due to a lower   gross margin and higher operating expenses. Share buybacks were   the sole source of per-share earnings growth.Apple is going to need to come up with something big in order   to grow earnings meaningfully in the coming years, but it's   unclear whether Apple will be able to come up with the next big   thing. Services revenue has been growing quickly for Apple,   but the jury is still out on whether this will be enough to drive   earnings higher.IBM's transformation makes progressIBM stock is also cheap, despite the rally over the past year.   The company produced $13.59 in adjusted EPS during 2016, putting   the P/E ratio at 13. IBM's earnings have been in decline for a   few years, and its revenue has been slumping since 2012. But its   multiyear transformation is making progress, and the company   expects to produce at least $13.80 in adjusted EPS this year.Image source: IBM.IBM has been divesting and shifting resources away from   shrinking legacy businesses, pouring money into growth   initiatives like cloud computing. This shift, while painful, is   now starting to bear fruit. IBM's strategic imperatives -- what   the company calls its various growth businesses -- now account   for 41% of total revenue after growing by 13% in 2016.The cloud-computing business is booming. Total cloud revenue   reached $13.7 billion in 2016, up 35%. Cloud delivered as a   service, which includes only infrastructure as a service,   platform as a service, and software as a service, is at an annual   revenue run rate of $8.6 billion, up 61% year over year. IBM's   ongoing shift to subscription software has hurt overall software   sales in the past couple of years, but thesoftware business has now posted growthfor three straight quarters.IBM's earnings have room to grow simply because the bottom   line has been beaten down so much over the past few years. As IBM   continues to remake itself as a cloud and cognitive computing   company, a return to consistent earnings growth is a real   possibility.IBM is the better betWhile I don't necessarily think that Apple is a bad   investment, I find it difficult to believe that the company will   be able to grow earnings from here. The iPhone is going to have   to hold up in a world where good phones are getting cheaper, and   the company is going to have to come up with something new and   innovative that can move the needle.IBM, on the other hand, has a much broader business, with a   vast customer base dependent on its products and services.   Earnings have room to grow substantially as the strategic   imperatives, which are more software-heavy than the company as a   whole, continue to expand. Given similar valuations, I'll take   IBM any day.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Would You Buy a $1,000 iPhone?;2/8/2017;"This year is a momentous one forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) because it marks the iPhone's 10th year. That's   ratcheting up expectations for what the company may have up its   sleeve, especially since 2016's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus only received   incremental updates within the same overall design (not like that   hurt sales at all).The most recent speculation comes fromFast Company, which is reporting that the 10th-generation iPhone might   incredibly be priced at $1,000 or more. That would be even higher   than $969 that it costs to buy a fully loaded iPhone 7 Plus with   256 GB of storage. As previously rumored (and widely expected at   this point), at least one variant may include an OLED display.   OLED displays don't come cheap, and the one that Apple is   thinking about using will probably cost about twice as much as   traditional LCD displays. Historically, the entire display   assembly often comprises about 40% of component costs, so a   potential price increase makes perfect sense to offset a cost   increase related to the most expensive component.Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Apple is reportedly still considering removing the physical   home button and potentially even the volume and lock buttons on   the sides, all of which would join the headphone jack in iHeaven.   The iPhone maker is collaborating withLumentum(NASDAQ: LITE) , whose shares were alreadypoppingafter earnings, to develop a 3D sensing technology that could be   used for facial recognition and other applications. RivalSamsungstarted introducing facial recognition features in its flagship   phones years ago.Think differentThe company is hoping to pack as many new features into the   high-end model as possible, which would help justify a four-digit   price tag. Apple has long enjoyed the strongest pricing power   within the smartphone industry, and this would potentially   represent the strongest exhibit of Apple flexing its pricing   muscles.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.If Apple can pull it off, a $1,000 price tag would clearly   boost average selling prices, the degree of which would depend on   product mix. Samsung has attempted to launch $1,000-plus phones   in the past, like 2013's horribly named Galaxy Round which   featured a curved AMOLED display that was responsible for the   higher price. But Samsung's error was believing that the curved   display itself would justify the premium to consumers, even   though the device was largely similar to other Galaxy phones at   the time in other respects. Apple's task, then, will be to   include enough differentiating factors in the $1,000 model to set   it apart.In recent years, carriers have shifted away from the subsidy   model and toward installment and leasing plans. At first,   consumers were hit with sticker shock that premium smartphones   cost over $600, as opposed to the subsidized $200 they had   previously been paying, but it's safe to say that at this point   consumers fully appreciate how much smartphones actually cost.   The increased pricing transparency associated with abandoning   subsidies indirectly helps lay the foundation for innovation,   because manufacturers can then appeal directly to consumers on   why a higher price tag is warranted by new features instead of   having to negotiate subsidy levels with carriers. The extra $20   bump associated with the iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera system is a   good example.Would you buy a $1,000 iPhone?10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Close Update: Dow Closes Lower As Falling Yields Continue to Weigh on Bank Stocks;2/8/2017;"The benchmark averages were mixed at Wednesday's close with the financial sector weighing on the Dow, but strength in tech shares driving the Nasdaq just shy of another record high. The S&P 500 closed fractionally higher on gains in the defensive and consumer sectors.Banking stocks have been underwater since the start of the week, plagued by lower Treasury yields as investors sought safe havens from the political environment in France and backlash from President Donald Trump's recent executive orders.And although yields were briefly tugged higher in the wake of today's disappointing 10-year auction, the 10-year yield has dropped nearly 9 basis points since last week. As a result shares of Dow component stocks Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM) led decliners again on Wednesday, offsetting gains in Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE).makeArticleAd();Earnings were also creating a drag on Wall Street Wednesday as Wall Street geared up for the final leg of fourth quarter results. Of the companies that reported Tuesday more than half beat EPS estimates, but less than half topped revenue expectations. Additionally, component stock Disney beat EPS estimates by a nickel, but missed revenue guidance by nearly half a billion dollars.The earnings onslaught continues Thursday with Twitter (TWTR), Yum Brands (YUM), Dunkin Brands (DNKN), and Reynolds American (RAI) among the big names reporting before the open. Economic data includes initial jobless claims and wholesale inventories and sales, with St Louis Fed President James Bullard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans scheduled to speak.

Is Apple Inc. on the Verge of Cracking This Fast-Growing Market?;2/8/2017;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is growing at a fast pace in India. The company   sold 2.5 million iPhones in the South Asian country in 2016, an   increase of almost 39% from estimated sales of 1.8 million units   the year before. Despite this impressive growth, India remains   just a small part of Apple's overall business.makeArticleAd();When compared to estimated global iPhone sales of around 234   million units for 2016, India makes up just over 1% of that   volume. This does not paint a very nice picture for the company   in a smartphone market that's currently growing at 18% compared   to the global average of just 3%.The reason for Apple's underperformance in India is quite   simple -- high prices in a country with low per capita income.   Consider this: India's GDP per capita in 2015 stood at $1,750,   while the price of the cheapest iPhone 7 in India is around $840   onAmazonat current exchange rates.However, recent sales trends in India clearly indicate that   the company is gaining traction among the big-ticket smartphone   buyers in the country. Counterpoint Research reports that Apple   currently commands 62% of the premium smartphone market (phones   costing more than $450) in the country, indicating that it is the   preferred brand for this group.Apple's reputation as a premium brand will be a tailwind in   the long run as India's GDP per capita is expected to rise to   $3,500 in 2020, according to Trading Economics. What's more,   Apple's recent negotiations with the Indian government regarding   the manufacturing of iPhones in the country indicate that it is   looking to make the most of the growing spending power of Indian   consumers.Plans for India get a boostThe Indian government is currently engaged in a campaign,   known as ""Make in India"", to encourage domestic manufacturing of   goods by inviting multi-national companies to set up shop in the   country. Apple is looking to take advantage of this campaign and   has proposed building a local manufacturing plant in   Bengaluru.Bengaluru (aka Bangalore) in India. Image source: Getty     Images.Apple executives, led by the Global Vice-President of iPhone   operations Priya Balasubramanian, met a group of ministers on   Jan. 25 to discuss the company's roadmap in the country. Both   parties discussed building a local manufacturing unit, while   Apple also put forward a list of concessions that it would need   from the government.The Wall Street Journalreported that an official with direct knowledge of the meeting   indicated that the deal between the government and Apple is   almost done. This means that Apple will gain customs duty   exemption on the import of equipment and components for a period   of 15 years.More importantly, Apple's deal with the Indian government   could lead to the opening of company-owned stores in the country.   In order to set up single-brand retail stores in India, the   government requires foreign companies to source 30% of their   manufacturing from local sources. Apple has requested relaxation   on this front, and if the deal closes, then it will soon be able   to set up its own stores in the country as well.Apple has reportedly taken steps to set up a manufacturing   unit in India already by selecting Wistron as its iPhone   manufacturer for the Indian market. The Taiwanese company is said   to be currently expanding its smartphone manufacturing capacity   in Bengaluru, according to theTimes of India.In January, an Indian government official said that Wistron   has requested rapid resolution to its request of expanding   manufacturing operations in Bengaluru. This indicates that it is   looking to meet the April target of beginning iPhone   manufacturing operations in the country.Apple has also lined up Foxconn to meet any surge in the   demand. Foxconn already has a plant in southern India, where it   has doubled its manufacturing capacity in just a year. Foxconn   has already pledged to set up another facility in the country   with an investment of $5 billion. These moves to expand capacity   among Apple's manufacturing partners indicate that they are   preparing for a boost in iPhone production in India.Lower iPhone prices and improving GDP will boost     salesOnce Apple sets up its manufacturing base in India, it will be   able to lower the price of its phones due to import tax   exemptions. Without the 12.5% import tax, Apple could shave   almost $100 from the price of an iPhone 7 in India.This will make Apple more competitive in the premium   smartphone segment as it can grab market share from the likes ofSamsungby offering better prices. This should help Apple achieve its   target of selling seven million iPhones in the country by   2018.Lower iPhone pricing will also allow Apple to benefit from   India's expanding smartphone market. Euromonitor International   forecasts that smartphone sales there will hit the 200 million   unit mark by 2020, as compared to estimated sales of just 102.4   million units in 2016.Paired with the growing spending power of Indian shoppers,   Apple can make significant strides in the country due to its   leading position in this segment.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Next Stop for Nokia Corp (ADR) Stock: $5 a Share!;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter reporting a weak third quarter,Nokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) pleased investors this time around by reporting that it would raise its dividends. It will go up from 17 cents to 18 cents a share.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Despite other disappointments in itsfourth quarter, investors bid NOK higher last week. What may follow for Nokia shares is the $5 level.NOK Stock Earnings RundownWeak Network Division:Sales at NOK's Network division fell 14% year-on-year. The market remains weak but Alcatel-Lucent lifted the performance of the unit. And Nokia maintained a strong gross margin of 40.6%. Operating margin of 8.9% for the full year is within the guidance NOK provided.Nokia Technologies:NOK's earnings did not benefit from IP payments fromSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) in the fourth quarter. The company expanded its IP licensing agreement. This is a move that should boost revenue for the technologies unit.Cashing in on Apple:Just asApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is cashing in on patents by suingQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for high IP royalties, Nokia is suing Apple for infringing on Nokia patents. With 50 patents involved in the suit, expect Nokia at least getting something from Apple. Also, Nokiasaid:""As of today, in actions across 11 countries in Asia, Europe and the US, there are now more than 50 Nokia patents in suit, covering technologies such as display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets, video coding, as well as 3G & 4G cellular standards. Apple has also filed certain complaints against Nokia.""At 1.15 times sales, investors are not pricing a litigation win in favor of Nokia. Even if NOK is successful, it will take years before the court makes a ruling. Nokia is not the only stock trading at low valuations.Ericsson(NASDAQ:ERIC) is valued at 0.7 times sales. ERIC reported quarterly results that only met earnings expectations. It earned seven cents per share in the quarter, compared to 13 cents per share for Nokia stock, which beat the consensus by five cents.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenOn its press release, NOK highlighted the $115 billion IP portfolio it holds, thanks to its ownership in Alcatel-Lucent. This further suggests that markets are ignoring the potential for more monetization of IP in the years ahead.Risks to NOK StockEquity and Expenses:Of the nearly $20.9 billion in equity, over half of that amount is goodwill and intangibles. In the fourth quarter, R&D expenses amounted to $1.34 billion. Most of that was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from the Alcatel-Lucent acquisition.Smartphone Sales Unknown:Nokia did not forecast revenue for its technologies division. But the company's base case for revenue from patent and brand licensing will total around $863 million annualized. Any new licensing agreement will raise that base case. The networks division represents the bulk of Nokia's business. The mediocre news is that sales are growing in the single digits in the best-case scenario. It expects the primary addressable market falling in the full year (2017). Higher competition and pricing pressure for networking goods will continue to exert negative pressure on the business.Apple Inc. Taps Head of Amazon Fire to Run Apple TV (AAPL)Takeaway on NOK shares:Headwinds are a worry for Nokia shareholders but the market has low expectations for the company. An early settlement with Apple on IP would bring much-needed revenue for the former smartphone giant. Higher customer spending on 5G and networking gear will give the company a lift this year. That will lead to a minimum $5 share price. That is, a forward price-earnings ratio of above 20 times, for Nokia's stock.As of this writing, Chris Lau was long NOK stock.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterThe postNext Stop for Nokia Corp (ADR) Stock: $5 a Share!appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in China;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this week, research firm IDC released a report indicating that, for the first time ever,Apple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone shipments to China have decreased significantly. According to the report, shipments of iPhones to China decreased last year to 44.9 million, a 23.2% decrease from 2015.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigital via FlickrApparently, Chinese smartphone makers, particularlyOppo,VivoandHuawei, have increased market share in the region by offering""higher-end gadgetry that appeals to consumers seeking Apple-like quality and innovation.""This has led to an overall decrease in the AAPL market share in China, down to 9.6% from 13.6% in 2015, and a subsequent drop in revenue - Apple's""fourth consecutive year-over-year dip in the region""- by 11.4%.This new situation is potentially disconcerting to a number of analysts and investors, as China has presented a fantastic opportunity for growth in years past.However, due to the challenges faced by American companies attempting to conduct business in China - namely, the Chinese government'soverbearing regulationand frequent demands for controversialapp and product modifications- coupled with the ""ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives,"" sales of the iPhone 7 were less than spectacular.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialSome analysts have attributed the reduced demand for the iPhone 7 to alack of innovationand significantly higher product prices compared to other countries. This is potentially disconcerting for AAPL stock management and investors alike, since ""China remains an important market for Apple, as it contributes 20.7% of its revenue and is the location for the bulk its [sic] manufacturing facilities.""It's quite possible that AAPL stock will recover in China, and the lull in sales and Chinese-based revenue will reverse when Apple finally reveals its 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone.Even considering the recent drop-off in both market share and sales in China, Apple stock is still going strong. According to Strategy Analytics, AAPL earned 91% of global smartphone operating profits in the third quarter.Bottom Line for AAPL Stock in ChinaOf the 43 analysts providing recommendations to MarketWatch.com, 33 call Apple stock a buy and 10 call it a hold. The average target price for AAPL stock is $140.57, which represents a potential upside of more than 7% from Tuesday's per-share closing price of $131.35.Overall, Apple stock is still one of the best choices for your tech-centered investment portfolio. While the struggle for dominance of market share in China will undoubtedly be a long and bloody battle, AAPL has a history of producing some of the world's most innovative and compelling products, and this reputation - and expectation from consumers and analysts alike - will ensure Apple stock remains on everybody's short list.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming ReboundCan FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postApple Inc.

Why a PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) Split Would Unlock 20% Upside;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMany investors have urgedPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP) to split into two companies over the years. One of the most vocal has been Nelson Peltz, the billionaire head ofTrian Fund Management, which in 2014disclosed it owned $1.2 billion worth of PEP stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Peltz then released a letter urging Pepsi's board of directors to split the company into two, using the proceeds from spinning out beverages towards buyingMondelez International Inc(NASDAQ:MDLZ).Peltz didn't get very far.PepsiCo passionately defended the status quo, saying the company's size helps give it clout with big retailers likeWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT). Having both soda and chips under one corporate roof makes it easier to gain display space. And management is convinced splitting the company in two would lead to negative synergies.Some of those arguments are valid, but one simple fact remains: Pepsi stock holders would be made richer if the company split in two.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Here's why.The Case for a PepsiCo SplitPepsiCo currently divides itself into six different operating divisions:Frito-Lay North AmericaQuaker Foods North AmericaNorth American BeveragesLatin AmericaEurope and Sub-Saharan AfricaPacific and Northern AfricaPepsi operates a little differently in North America versus the rest of the world. In North America, Frito-Lay, Quaker Foods and Beverages are all essentially separate companies. They have different sales teams and different offices, and share little in resources. The three divisions work together in various promotions, but that's about it.Operations in the rest of the world are much different, with chips and soda delivered on the same trucks in many different places.For the sake of this article, let's assume the two North American food companies would form one new company, leaving everything else as the other company.Now we have to look at valuation. In 2015 (the latest fiscal year in which full results are available), PepsiCo as a whole earned $8.35 billion in operating profits. Add back in unusual expenses - which mostly included a $1.4 billion write-off of Venezuelan assets - of $1.59 billion, and PEP posted $9.94 billion in normalized operating profits.PepsiCo has a current market cap of $153 billion, putting PEP stock at a price-to-operating income ratio of about 15.Once we dig a little deeper into the numbers, a theme starts to emerge: Food is a better business than soda.The Value of FoodThe North American Beverages division posted an operating income of $2.75 billion on revenue of $20.62 billion in 2015, good enough for an operating margin of 13.3%. In comparison, the combined Frito-Lay and Quaker North American divisions delivered operating profits of $4.89 billion on sales of $17.33 billion - an operating margin of 28.2%.In short, the soda business is dragging down the real performer: PepsiCo's food business.There is no other major food company in the United States that has 28% operating margins. Most are in the neighborhood of 15%, just like PEP as a whole.There is one that gets close, however.The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) posted 23% operating margins in 2015. It trades at 18 times operating earnings, but shares are flirting with a 52-week low.If we value a combined Frito-Lay/Quaker company at 20 times operating earnings, it alone would be worth $97.8 billion. That valuation gives it a premium versus Coca-Cola, but not an excessive one. Then if we value the rest of Pepsi at 15 times operating income, it's worth $75.8 billion.The Smart Money: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Already InsolventAdd the two divisions together, and Pepsi split into two is worth $173.6 billion - or 20% more than the value of PEP stock today.Bottom Line on PEP StockOne thing is certain. Frito-Lay chips, Quaker Oats and Aunt Jemina syrup are great businesses. Making food is much more profitable on a per-dollar basis than soda.Every PEP stock holder knows the company owns Frito-Lay and Quaker. Many don't know how good those businesses are. If PepsiCo's management spun those two divisions out into a new company, it would highlight just how good the food business really is.It also would attract investors who don't want to invest in soda.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Is a Great Contrarian OpportunityIs Apple Inc.

Earnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt seems unlikely that from a fundamental standpoint, there will be a lot of news in thePandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) earnings report on Thursday.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPandora already announced last month that fourth-quarter results would come in ahead of guidance for both revenue and adjusted Ebitda. That disclosure sent P stock up 6%, and would seem to limit the possibility that the numbers in the Pandora earnings report will boost the stock further.That doesn't mean there will be no news coming out of Pandora earnings. The company has set itself up for a busy 2017. The replacement of Pandora One with Pandora Plus appears to have had some success in the fourth quarter. Commentary on that initiative will be closely watched on the Q4 conference call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announced a new ""Premium"" service to compete with offerings fromSpotify,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThat product should roll out shortly, potentially boosting growth in 2017. And Pandora has said it is aiming to return to Ebitda profitability in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investors in P stock should believe the company.A Busy 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actually is up about 65% over the past year, after coming close to all-time lows in early 2016. Those gains have come despite mixed performance in the business. Revenue is up 14% through the first nine months, and likely rose a similar figure in Q4. But about half the year-to-date growth came from the acquisition of TicketFly last October. Advertising revenue also increased 14% through the first three quarters - but came solely from higher pricing. Active users were actually down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscription revenue declined in the quarter as well.The user and subscription figures are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simply doesn't trust that Pandora can create consistent profits based on advertising revenue alone. That's particularly true given thehigher royalty ratesthat took effect at the beginning of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrade One to Plus - adding features like song replays - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-based model.The plan from Pandora, as detailed after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provide a more stable revenue base. Moving customers to subscription-based services both helps margins and improves retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock likely will rise. But that remains a relatively big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earnings report, then, the most important numbers likely will come from the company's guidance. That guidance will give some color as to how successful management thinks Plus has been so far - and what kind of opportunity Premium has to boost Pandora earnings this year.But the Pandora earnings conference call also seems like it might move P stock. Management will have another opportunity to detail its strategy for 2017 and beyond. The company laid out its ""three-legged stool"" strategy - Plus, Premium and Ticketfly - after the third quarter, but investors weren't terribly impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsThe issue with P stock is that there's a real fear that Pandora's model simply doesn't quite work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenced by the nearly 80 million active users. But it's not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalty rates through ad revenue alone. The company did announce layoffs ofabout 7%of its employees in a bid to improve 2017 profits. That simply raised additional concerns about Pandora stock. The most notable is: Can Pandora really compete with Apple, Spotify andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?After all, those companies have much larger businesses - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the company has burned about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarters of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is likely to be huge as well, and that's not counting depreciation or the additional $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreciate in the near term, the company needs to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidance given in the Pandora earnings report will be key. But that aside, investors also will be looking for more information on the plan going forward here.Can Pandora find a niche in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offerings from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there really a profitable business model here, or are royalty rates simply too difficult to manage?Those questions can't be answered quite yet, but investors will be looking at the Pandora earnings report closely to better assess the company's prospects. And it's likely the commentary on the future - not the past - that will determine how Pandora stock reacts to Q4 earnings.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Technology ETFs Hitting All-Time High;2/8/2017;"Most of the sectors have been shining this year on proposed Trump policies and stronger earnings and, technology is no exception. In fact, almost every corner of the tech sector is delivering robust performances pushing the stocks higher (read:Will Trump's New Policies Hurt These Sector ETFs & Stocks?).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Behind the SurgeMost of the gains came from a string of better-than-expected Q4 results from heavyweights such as IntelINTC, International Business MachinesIBM, NetflixNFLX, MicrosoftMSFT, AppleAAPLand FacebookFBthat have injected a strong momentum into the entire sector, pushing many stocks to fresh highs.Additionally, a strengthening economy and better job prospects gave a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. Consolidation, increasing consumer spending and rising consumer confidence added to the strength.  Particularly, global IT spending is expected to increase 2.7% to $3.5 trillion this year, according to Gartner while Forrester projects spending to grow 3-4%.In the current emerging digital world, demand for advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data, smartphones, high-speed fiber networks and the Internet of Things is growing by leaps and bounds. The adoption of innovative products such as wearables, VR headsets, drones, and virtual reality devices are fast becoming technology staples for savvy Americans. This is creating great opportunities for tech companies.Not to forget, most of these tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Further, Trump's proposed corporate tax reform, that could allow companies to bring back cash being held overseas at lower rates, is good for tech companies though his protectionist rhetoric including crackdown on immigration and travel ban is weighing on the sector (read:Top ETF Stories of January 2017).Moreover, the upside in this corner of the space could be confirmed by the ZacksSectorRank in the top 38% at the time of writing, suggesting solid growth prospects in the coming months.Given this, tech ETFs have been hitting all-time high levels in recent trading sessions. While the ascent has spread to most corners of the space, we have highlighted one fund from each corner. Any of the following could be a solid pick for investors to ride out the surge in the space.First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETFCIBRThe fund offers global exposure to the companies engaged in the cyber security segment of the technology and industrials sectors by tracking the Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index. In total, the product holds 30 stocks in its basket with none accounting for more than 7.2% of the portfolio. It is skewed toward the software industry at 55.4% while communications equipment round off the next spot with a double-digit allocation.

How Good Was Apple Inc.'s Q1 Earnings Report?;2/8/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has soared about 8% since the company   reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings results last week.   Revenue hit a new record of $78.4 billion, $1 billion ahead of   the average analyst estimate. Earnings per share also reached a   record at $3.36, up from $3.28 a year earlier. This was $0.15   ahead of analysts' estimates.Thanks to this strong performance, numerous Wall Street   analystsraised their price targetsforApple stock. Still, not everybody is convinced. Some pundits have argued   that Apple's results were far worse than Mr. Market seems to   think. Let's take a look at whether there's any substance to that   argument.Good results aside from the iPadFrom a high-level perspective, Apple's Q1 earnings report   looks rock solid. Sure, iPad sales declined yet again -- with   unit sales down 19% year over year and revenue down 22% -- but   the iPad is far less important for Apple's business than it was a   few years ago. Apple only got 7% of its revenue from iPad sales   last quarter.makeArticleAd();The iPad is becoming less and less important to Apple's     results. Image source: Apple.The iPhone business is what really matters for Apple these   days. Apple sold a record 78.3 million iPhones last quarter,   generating $54.4 billion of revenue -- nearly 70% of the   companywide total. Mac sales also returned to growth and the   services segment continued to surge higher, with revenue up 18%   year over year.Did Apple pull a fast one on investors?Writing for MarketWatch last week, Thomas Kee, Jr. argued that   investors have completely misunderstood Apple's earnings report.   He points out that Apple's fiscal first quarter had an extra week   this year.Measured on a per-week basis, Apple's revenue, iPhone sales,   and EPS were alldown on a year-over-year basis. In other words, without the extra week, Apple would likely have   posted declines rather than increases for all three key metrics.   As a result, Kee thinks that Apple stock is significantly   overvalued.It's true that the extra week helped Apple last quarter.   However, in highlighting one anomaly in Apple's first quarter   results, Kee ignored two others that hurt Apple during the   quarter.Channel inventory changes weighed Apple downFirst, Apple is being much more careful with channel inventory   this year than it was in fiscal 2016. Since Apple reports revenue   when it ships devices to retailers -- not when they are sold to   end users -- changes in channel inventory can distort Apple's   revenue and earnings relative to underlying demand.Apple didn't increase iPhone channel inventory by very much     in Q1. Image source: Apple.For the iPhone, Apple grew channel inventory by 1.2 million   units last quarter. This means that 77.1 million of the 78.3   million iPhones Apple shipped during Q1 made it into the hands of   customers.By contrast, a year earlier, Apple increased iPhone channel   inventory by 3.3 million units. Sell-through to end users totaled   71.5 million in that quarter. After adjusting for these channel   inventory changes, last quarter's weekly iPhone sales rate was   almost exactly in line with the prior-year result.This adjustment is even starker for the iPad. Apple reduced   its iPad channel inventory by about 700,000 units last quarter,   compared to a 900,000-unit increase a year earlier. This explains   about half of the year-over-year decline in iPad sales. The   negative impact of the channel inventory changes more than offset   the benefit of having an extra week.A patent settlement skewed Apple's Q1 2016 resultsA second factor that hurt Apple last quarter is that it had   received a one-time $548 million gain related to a patent   infringement case in Q1 2016. This was pure profit, so it boosted   Apple's gross margin by more than 0.7 percentage points in that   quarter and added about $0.10 per share in pre-tax income.Stripping out this one-time gain and the changes in channel   inventory, Apple's revenue and EPS growth would have been much   higher last quarter than what the company actually reported.Additionally, the $548 million patent gain in Q1 2016 created   a tough comparison for Apple's fast-growing services segment last   quarter. Apple reported 18% revenue growth in services last   quarter anyway, but on an apples-to-apples basis it would have   posted a 30% revenue increase.Apple's quarter was as strong as it seemed to beIt's impossible to know precisely how much channel inventory   changes impacted Apple's revenue and profit last quarter. But a   reasonable guess is that they cost Apple $2 billion-$2.5 billion   of revenue and close to $1 billion of pre-tax profit, relative to   Q1 2016. The non-recurrence of the patent gain was an additional   $548 million headwind to revenue and pre-tax profit.After making these adjustments, Apple's revenue may have been   down slightly year-over-year on a per-week basis, but EPS still   increased. Even this sort of slow growth is fairly good for Apple   right now, as the strong dollar is causing persistent revenue and   profit headwinds.Furthermore, Apple is widely believed to be working on a   massive upgrade of the iPhone for 2017. There's a good chance   that these rumors are already impacting the upgrade rate as some   customers hold out for the new model. That bodes well for a   return to robust (and indisputable) revenue and earnings growth   in 2018.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsForNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), 2016 was as good a year as it was for the Atlanta Falcons. But we know how the Falcons' story ended.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIs NVDA stock about to undergo a similar fourth-quarter collapse?Going into the Feb. 9 earnings report,analysts are wary, with just half saying buy and most of the rest saying hold - which is something they say when they don't know what to say.Earnings are expected to be just a little better than the previous quarter, net income of something over $550 million, 87 cents per share, on revenues of $2.11 billion, just a little more than last quarter's $2 billion.If Nvidia meets those expectations, however, or even exceeds them only by a little bit, I expect NVDA stock to fall. Here is why.An Overpriced StockNVDA is, to the surprise of no one, incredibly overpriced right now. At the opening bid of $119 per share on Feb. 8, Nvidia stock is trading for 44 times next year's earnings estimates. Its market cap, almost $65 billion, is 13 times its fiscal 2016 revenue, and nearly 9 times its anticipated 2017 revenue.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterMeeting analysts' targets this quarter will show that its incredible October performance was not a fluke, where revenues rose 60% over the previous quarter and profits doubled.My call is not based on Nvidia having done anything wrong.In fact, it isdoing an enormous amount right.Its graphics chips are finding new markets in cloud data centers and in cars. Its original niche in gaming is the only thing happening in the PC space. Huge new markets in augmented and virtual reality are beckoning. Along withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), Nvidia is ending the age ofIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) general purpose microprocessors, replacing it withan era of specialization.The problem is,as our Tim Biggan has observed, that NVDA stock is currently priced for perfection, and perfection is in the eye of the beholder. Any misstep, even an imagined one, can hit a stock hard when it's up 280% in a year.Lots of things could happen. Analysts could decide that meeting expectations is not good enough. They could find a shinier object somewhere else in the market. They could start getting jumpy over a possible trade war, one that has alreadystarted with curbs on visas.Or, perhaps, Nvidia could get intoa spat over licensing of intellectual property, a hot topic wherever silicon chips are made and sold.It's possible.Who Missed the Boat on NVDA Stock?Of course, there is always the chance that this is wishful thinking, as often occurs with hot stocks.Investors and analysts who missed the boat on a stock will talk it down, in hopes that it will drop and they can get on board. This has happened many times with such stocks asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). No tree grows to the sky.For these investors, a fall in Nvidia stock of 15%, to a market cap of about $50 billion - worth 7 times 2017 revenue - would seem more reasonable.Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction?What happens in these cases is that a stock will start to fall, and investors will immediately buy it back to its original, overvalued position. Nvidia does make some very hot hardware, it is continually pushing the performance envelope, and it has strong positions in all the fastest-growing markets of our time.This is one of the differences between investing and trading that investors need to understand. Traders want a hot stock to go down, but that desire, or that fact, does not mean a hot company has grown cold.It means that a lot of people who missed a good dealstill want it.NVDA stock may indeed fall after earnings Thursday evening, in other words. But if it does, a lot of investors will be waiting to pick it up and consider it a bargain.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy best results inTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) trades have come fromselling premium against extreme opinions. But in this uber-bullish market environment, I am left only wanting to go long momentum stocks like TSLA orNetflix, Inc(NASDAQ:NFLX).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, Wall Street seems to have given up looking at Tesla as a car company. The majority of traders I know perceive TSLA as a technology company centering around the battery and sun power.Although fundamentally, TSLA is a difficult stock to recommend at these levels, technically I can argue it wants to retest the all-time highs soon. Luckily, the options markets give me several ways I can enter long trades while building healthy buffer zones.TSLA Stock Trade IdeaClick to EnlargeThe Trade:Sell the TSLA Sep $200 put. This is a bullish trade priced for $11 per contract to open. The 22% buffer from current levels gives me an 80% theoretical chance of success.If TSLA falls below my strike price, I could be put the stock, so I only sell the naked put if I am willing and able to own it at that level. In that case my breakeven price would be $189 per share.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe Hedge - Optional:Sell the Sep TSLA $340 call and collect an additional $5.50 per contract. This trade has an 80% theoretical chance of success. I need TSLA stock to stay under my sold leg or be open to losses. Taking both trades would put me in a sold strangle and widen my breakeven zone to $182 vs. $357.50 per share. I am not rushing to enter the hedge at this time.Selling naked options on a high dollar stock is definitely not suited for everyone. So I can modify the trade to diffuse its risk.The Alternate:Sell the TSLA Sep $200/$195 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade for which I collect $1.20 per contract. I still need TSLA to stay above my spread to win. Yield on this trade if successful would be 25% on money risked. Theoretically, this also has an 80% theoretical chance of success.This alternate trade could be hedged by selling TSLA Sep $340/$345 credit call spread. This would potentially give me an additional 65 cents per contract thereby lowering my dollars at risk. If both sides of the alternates are successful, the sold iron condor would yield 55% on money risked.As I mentioned earlier, TSLA stock is looking technically frisky, so a very bullish play on that would be to sell the puts and buy near-the-money calls to really profit from a rally for free.Note that earnings are coming soon, and those add an extra layer of chance into the mix.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Akamai (AKAM) Down Despite Q4 Earnings & Revenue Beat;2/8/2017;"Shares ofAkamai Technologies Inc.AKAMfell 3.7% in after-hour trading following the company's fourth-quarter 2016 results. The decline apparently reflects conservative management guidance, which now expects margins to remain under pressure in the near term, due to continuing investments on new growth avenues like Enterprise Solution portfolio.makeArticleAd();However, Akamai believes that these investments will drive top-line growth in the long term. Management plans to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the long term.Adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation) of 55 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation but excluding all other non-recurring items and related tax impact) of 72 cents remained flat on a year-over-year basis but increased almost 6% sequentially.Akamai Technologies, Inc.

The revenues were better than management's guided range of $593-$613 million. The growth was driven by strong holiday season media traffic.Excluding Internet Platform Customers, revenues increased 14.4% year over year (also 15% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 6% quarter over quarter.Revenues from Internet Platform Customers were $58.4 million, plunging 36.3% year over year (down 40% adjusted for foreign exchange) primarily due to the company's do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives of building CDN. Sequentially, revenues from Internet Platform Customers inched up 0.6%.Amazon.comAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix are the six large customers in the Internet Platform group. Collectively these six companies accounted for less than 10% of the Akamai's fourth-quarter 2016 revenues down from almost 16% in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted earnings were $2.70 per share, up 7.1% driven by revenue growth of 6.5%, which totaled $2.34 billion in full year 2016. Revenue excluding Internet Platform Customers was $2.09 billion, up 15% from 2015. Cloud Security Solutions revenue was $365 million, up 43% on a year-over-year basis (up 44% when adjusted for foreign exchange).Segment DetailsEffective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions - Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier.

Excluding Internet Platform customers, revenues advanced 15% from the year-ago quarter.Web Division - Revenues increased 13.4% year over year (up 14% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 5.5% sequentially to $300.3 million. Growth was driven by strong customer base, especially with regard to the cloud security business.Enterprise and Carrier Division - Revenues of $15 million surged 26.2% from the year-ago quarter (43% adjusted for foreign exchange) but declined 2.1% on sequential basis.However, in order to give better perspective to its investors, the company continued to report results per its old structure (solution category-wise).Performance & security solutions revenues were up 16.7% year over year (19% adjusted for foreign exchange) to $367.4 million. Of it, $102 million was generated from Akamai's cloud security solutions, which surged 41% on a year-over-year basis.Service & support system revenues rose 14.4% year over year to $52.6 million while Media Delivery solutions sales declined 10.2% year over year to $196.1 million. Excluding the six large Internet platform customers, Media Delivery revenues were up 8% year over year.On a sequential basis, Performance & security, Media Delivery solutions and Service & support system increased 6.5%, 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively.Operating DetailsReported gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 200 bps to 67% in the quarter.Akamai reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%, down 100 bps each both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.As percentage of revenues, reported research & development (R&D) expense increased 110 bps year over year and 30 bps sequentially. General & Administrative (G&A) expense also increased 170 bps from the year-ago quarter but declined 40 bps from the previous quarter.The year-over-year increase in these expenses were partially mitigated by lower selling & marketing (S&M) expense, which declined 120 bps on a year-over-year basis. However, on a sequential basis S&M increased 170 bps.Reported operating margin contracted 110 bps on a year-over-year basis but expanded 90 bps sequentially to 20%. Adjusted operating margin declined 130 bps from the year-ago quarter but increased 40 bps from the previous quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs on Dec 31, 2016, Akamai's cash and cash equivalents (and marketable securities) were $837 million compared with $868.7 billion as of Sep 30, 2016. The company generated cash flow from operations of $181.8 million as compared with $251.4 million in the previous quarter.Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter. In 2016, free cash flow soared 72% year over year to $550 million.In the quarter, Akamai repurchased 1.3 million shares for $79 million. In full year 2016, the company spent $374 million on buying back approximately 7 million shares.GuidanceFor first-quarter 2017, Akamai continues to expect foreign exchange to remain a headwind due to strengthening of the U.S dollar. Further, revenues are expected to decline sequentially due to seasonal weakness particularly in the Media business. The company expects revenues in the range of $596 million to $610 million.Reported gross margins are expected to be 65%. Adjusted operating expenses are anticipated in the range of $217-$222 million, down sequentially.Further, EBITDA margin is anticipated to be approximately 39-40%. Management forecasts EBITDA margins to remain in the high 30% range in 2017.Depreciation is expected to be in the range of $74-$76 million. Adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be in the range of 27-28% for the quarter.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of 66-69 cents per share.In terms of capital expenditure, Akamai expects to spend approximately $90-$96 million in the quarter. For full year 2017, capital expenditure would equate to 16-18% of revenues, in line with the company's long-term model of 16-18% of revenues and better than 14% in 2016.Our TakeAkamai is likely to benefit from the rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video. Additionally, it is likely to gain from its strong foothold in the web applications domain. New products like Enterprise Application Access (EAA) and the Enterprise Threat Protector (ETP) service will expand customer base going ahead.However, DIY initiatives by the large Internet companies remain a concern for the company's media delivery business. Moreover, recently launched products like Bot Manager and Image Manager will take some time to fully penetrate the market. Hence, we don't expect revenue growth to accelerate at least in the near term.Further, faster increase in capital expenditure and increasing headcount investment will keep margins under pressure in full year 2017.Despite the headwinds, we believe that the company has significant growth prospect in 2017. We note that Akamai has outperformed the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry in the last one-year. While the stock has gained 79.8%, the industry returned 18.5% over the same period.Currently, Akamai carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

Here's Why Disney's Movie Business Is Likely to Power the Company in 2017;2/8/2017;"Walt Disney (Shutterstock photo)Aside from the very important matter over whether Bob Iger willremainas CEO, The Walt Disney Company (DIS) has had concerns about whether its cable business is dragging down the entire company, as ESPN continues to see subscriber losses. However, it's the company's movie business that's likely to help boost results in 2017, as box office dominance continues for the House of Mouse.Box Office HitsmakeArticleAd();During the calendar fourth-quarter, Disney had over $2 billion in box office revenue, withDr. Strange,Rogue One: A Star Wars StoryandMoanaeach surpassed $500 million, andRogue Onetopped $1 billion. In a world increasingly growing tired of the same old movie choices and the looming threat of superhero fatigue, these results are nothing short of impressive.Of the top five movies at the box office in calendar 2016, all of them were from Disney, according toBox Office Mojo. Disney has managed to take a business such as film, which is notoriously fickle, and churn out hit after hit.Looking ahead to calendar 2017, Disney shareholders can expect more of the same, asBeauty and the Beastis released next month and the year's penultimate film will beStar Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, which hits theaters in December. No longer does Disney release movies that aren't going to be sure fire hits. In 2017, it will release just seven movies, compared to 17 from Warner Bros., which will have box office hits likeThe Lego Batman,Wonder WomanandJustice League, but also smaller releases likeFist Fight,CHiPs,Itand several others.Changing of the Guard(ians)This is no small feat, as Disney likely says no to several good movie ideas for fear they will not resonate with global audiences. That's a similar mindset to what Apple (AAPL) has done with its product lines -- it says no to more good ideas than it says yes to, simply because everything must be great.In a note discussing the company's fiscal first-quarter results, Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker highlighted that 2017 will see ""SO many good movies coming outBeauty & The Beast,Guardians of the Galaxy 2,Pirates of the Caribbean,Cars 3&Coco,"" but it won't be enough to offset the film slate from 2016, which includedStar Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens.Cable ConcernsDisney is slowly turning its movie business into a subscription business, one with predictable revenues as its other subscription business, Cable, continues to experience uneven results.During the first-quarter, Disney noted that even though operating income at its Cable networks was flat, thanks to lower programming costs and higher affiliate fees, it still saw ""a decline in subscribers"" (i.e. declines at ESPN).Tonally, Iger has been more positive on ESPN in the past couple of quarters, despite the continued trouble for the worldwide leader in sports programming.On the call, Iger said that while the troubles at ESPN get their fair share of attention in the media, ESPN has been expanding its presence in over-the-top bundles, including DirecTV Now, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and the upcoming Hulu package.Iger also mentioned that Disney ""will be launching a direct-to-consumer sports service sometime in probably calendar 2017,"" but little else was said about it. It's not known if it will be a full-on version of ESPN like what Time Warner has done with HBO Now or if it will be stripped down.Either way, it's important that Disney continue to release direct-to-consumer cable products, as the media landscape continues to change at a breakneck pace.Studio, Parks SupportIt's likely that the Studio business, along with its incredible Parks business, is likely to support Disney shares in fiscal 2017, as ESPN continues to figure out its future in a shifting television landscape.With a strong buyback plan in place, exceptional box office results and the aforementioned Parks business, Disney shareholders are likely to keep singing""you've got a friend in me""-- even beforeToy Story 4hits theaters."
If It Weren't For Capital Returns, Apple Would Have Nearly $400 Billion in Cash By Now;2/8/2017;"Here's an interesting factoid: IfApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had not implemented its capital return program   back in 2012 and consistently updated it in the years since, the   Mac maker would be sitting on nearly $400 billion in cash.That's not to say that I believe Apple's capital returns are a   mistake. Quite the contrary; I'm a huge fan.A numbers gameAs of the end of 2016, Apple had approximately $246 billion in   total cash on the balance sheet. After adjusting for $77 billion   in total term debt, that leaves a net cash position of $169   billion. But that debt load is predominantly there in order to   fund Apple's capital return program, so if we wanted to imagine   how much cash Apple would have absent its capital return program,   you need to add the total amount returned cumulatively to date to   the current net cash position. Between dividends, dividend   equivalents, net share settlements, and share repurchases, Apple   has now returned $201 billion total. Here's a breakdown:makeArticleAd();Type of Capital ReturnCumulative ReturnedShare repurchases$144 billionDividends and equivalents$51 billionNet share settlement$6 billionTotal$201 billionData source: Apple.Theoretically adding that all back in to net cash, Apple would   be sitting on $370 billion in cash right about now. If it weren't   already clear, that's an inordinate amount of money and far more   than any company would ever need to operate.To help put the sheer magnitude of that hypothetical figure   into perspective, consider how few companies ever get their   entire market capitalization or enterprise value that high.   That's comparable to the current market caps of peer tech giantsAmazon.com($383 billion) andFacebook($381 billion). That's equal to the entire 2015 GDP of the United   Arab Emirates.Thanks, TimNot only does Apple earn very little on that cash since it   invests very conservatively (in CEO Tim Cook's words from 2013,   Apple's investment subsidiary only invests in ""the most conservative investments known to   man""), but that cash also needlessly inflates Apple's total assets.   This in turn increases the shareholders' equity on the balance   sheet.Tim Cook holding the billionth iPhone. Image source:     Apple.In itself, this isn't cause for concern, but there are many   important performance metrics that investors look at which are   derived from these figures. Ratios like return on assets (ROA) or   return on equity (ROE) come to mind, which suffer and reflect   negatively on management's performance if the denominator is   excessively large for no good reason.Steve Jobs had long been irrationally averse to any type of   capital return program, and Cook's implementation of one is   easily one of the most financially significant things he has done   for investors.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Mutual Funds to Buy on Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) Robust Earnings;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe tech sector has performed favorably in recent times on the back of encouraging earnings results. Although Trump's proposed trade and immigration policies are expected to weigh on big technology companies, hiscorporate tax repatriation planscould benefit technology companies that hold a lot of cash overseas. These tech companies could repatriate that cash and use it for investments, dividends and buybacks.makeArticleAd();Tech behemothApple, Inc.(AAPL) made a strong rebound on the back of strong fiscal first-quarter earnings results. The good show was driven by impressive iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales. Following these promising trends, investing in technology mutual funds with a significant holding in the iPhone maker and other tech giants will be a prudent decision.Apple's Q1 Earnings in Focus: It's a Blowout QuarterApple's fiscal first-quarter earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3% respectively. Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year to nearly $7.2 billion.Additionally, total iPhone unit sales came in at about $78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue). Moreover, optimism of the tech behemoth's forthcoming series of iPhone upgrades in the coming months encouraged some analysts to raise their price targets.Apple Rally Boosts Tech SectorGains in Apple came as a breather for the broader technology sector.The iPhone maker remained the biggest company in the index in terms of market capitalization. Along with Apple some other big tech companies likeMicrosoft  Corporation(MSFT),Alphabet Inc(GOOGL),Netflix, Inc.(NFLX) andFacebook Inc(FB) reported solid earnings results.Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) and revenues for fiscal Q2 beat our estimates, while Alphabet reported higher-than-expected revenues for the Q4. Both Netflix's and Facebook's top and bottom line for the Q4 beat our respective estimates.For the overall Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 84% of the sector's total market cap.Total earningsfor these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues, with 71.1% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates.In the past three months, the tech sector jumped 9.8%, remaining one of the best performers among theS&P 500sectors. In the last one month, the tech sector rose 2.7%, way above the S&P 500's gain of 0.7%.Additionally, mutual funds related to this sector registered strong returns.

These stock research reports have been hand-picked from the 70 or so reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today's research reportshere >>In addition to these stock research reports, we are also giving you a real-time scorecard of the ongoing Q4 earnings season. We take pride in closely monitoring each and every earnings release and presenting our analysis of emerging trends in the weekly Earnings Trends and Earnings Preview reports. Our latest Earnings Preview report is:All-Time Record Earnings in Q4Q4 Earnings Scorecard(as of Tuesday, February 7th)We now have Q4 results from 302 S&P 500 members, or 60.3% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for the 302 index members that have reported results already are up +6.6% on +4.7% higher revenues, with 68.5% beating EPS estimates and 55% beating revenue estimates.This is better earnings and revenue growth performance than we have seen from this group of 302 S&P 500 members in other recent periods, even after adjusting for the strong growth from the Finance sector (earnings growth would be +5.2% excluding the Finance sector on +4.7% higher revenues). The proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates, however, is tracking below other recent periods. Only 41.1% of the index members are able to beatbothEPS and revenue estimates, which compares to 50% in the preceding quarter for the same sample of 302 S&P 500 members (the 4-quarter average is 47.4% & the 12-quarter average is 45.7%).Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 302 index members with estimates from the still-to-come 198 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +7.1% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. This is the best earnings and revenue growth pace in two years. Importantly, the strong Q4 growth is not a function of easy comparisons, but rather a result of actual gains. The fact is total earnings for the S&P 500 index are on track to reach an all-time quarterly record, surpassing the level achieved in 2014 Q4.Estimates for the current period (2017 Q1) are holding up fairly well; they are coming down, but not at the pace as would typically expected. Total earnings for the index are currently expected to be up +8% in Q1, which is down from +10.3% on January 4th.Today's Featured Research ReportsAppleshares have gained +20.2% over the last six months and have outperformed the broader market with the S&P 500 gaining +4.7% over the same period. Apple reported impressive first-quarter fiscal 2017 results with both earnings and revenues exceeding expectations while registering decent year-over-year growth. The increase in iPhone demand caused by the launch of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was the primary factor for such strong numbers. Also, ""Services"" revenues, which include App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay were impressive with App store sales in December alone topping $3 billion. The buzz surrounding iPhone 8, which is already labeled a super cycle, should allay investors fear about iPhone sales trajectory. However, macroeconomic headwinds in some key regions, most importantly in China along with increasing competition remain a concern.

The company's first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings easily outpaced expectations. Results were aided by the acquisition of Visa Europe and solid growth in payments volume as well as processed transactions. The analyst likes the company's strategic acquisitions and alliances, technology upgrades and effective marketing efforts. (You canread the full research report on Visa here     >>)AbbVieshares have gained +14.7% over the last one year, outperforming the large cap pharma industry, which has gained +5% over the same period. AbbVie delivered mixed fourth-quarter results with earnings meeting estimates but sales missing the same. The analyst likes its key drug Humira's performance. Sales should continue to be driven by growing awareness, favorable clinical data, additional indications and expansion into new markets. Moreover, products like Viekira and Imbruvica have diversified AbbVie's revenue base. AbbVie has a deep and promising pipeline and is also working on expanding its portfolio though additional deals. On the flip side, the Zacks analyst points out that Viekira faces intense pricing pressure and competition in the HCV market. Additionally, quite a few companies are working on bringing Humira biosimilars to the market.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction?;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's no doubt thatApple Inc(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been on fire lately. AAPL stock is up roughly 24% since November, and shares recently popped more than 8% following asolid first-quarter earnings report.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockIn fact, Apple's year is shaping up to be a banner one - especially if the iPhone supercycle comes to pass for the iPhone 8, as many analysts are predicting.But while the long-term looks rosy for AAPL stock, there is plenty of short-term risk in the shares right now.Click to EnlargeApple's impressive run and earnings surge has put shares well into overbought territory. Additionally, AAPL stock is struggling to pull away from the gravity of $130 - an area rife with heavy options open interest in the February and March series.Furthermore, AAPL stock has outrun support from its 10- and 20-day moving averages - trendlines that provided key support throughout the back half of Apple's late 2016 rally. Currently, the 10-day trendline lies near $125, and a correction back to this region would not be unthinkable should a round of profit taking set in.There are short-term sentiment risks for AAPL stock as well. Thomson/First Call reports that 41 of the 49 analysts following Apple rate the shares a ""buy"" or better, with only one ""sell"" rating to be found.That's plenty of room for adjustment.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterAnd with Apple drawing near to the consensus 12-month price target of $139.07, we could see a few brokerage firms downgrade AAPL stock to hold in the next month or so to bring expectations back in line - similar to what Barclays did back in late January, cutting AAPL to ""equalweight"" from ""overweight.""Looking at Apple options, speculative traders appear to be preparing for just such a correction. Typically, Apple's put/call open interest ratio for the nearest two months rests in the 0.6-0.7 range, with a heavy focus toward call OI. The current February/March ratio, however, rests at 0.9, with puts gaining considerable traction and hinting at potential short-term weakness for AAPL stock.As for the magnitude of the anticipated move, March implieds are pricing in the potential for a nearly 4% rise or fall in Apple stock ahead of expiration. That places the upper bound near $135 and the lower bound near $125.Given Apple's reluctance to continue to move higher in the wake of last week's earnings, a correction to the stock's 10-day moving average near $125 could be in the cards.2 Trades for AAPL StockPut Spread:Those traders looking to profit from a short-term drop in Apple might want to consider a March $125/$130 bear put spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1.28, or $128 per pair contracts. Breakeven lies at $128.72, while a maximum profit of $3.72, or $372 per pair of contracts, is possible if AAPL stock closes at or below $125 when March options expire.Ride Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock on Its Next Pop HigherPut Sell:If you're not willing to bet directly against Apple  stock at this point - and with the shares on a hot streak now, I wouldn't blame you - then we can turn that put spread into a more neutral play by just selling the March $125 put. At last check, this put was bid at 68 cents, or $68 per contract.As always, the upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as Apple stock closes above $125 when March options expire. The downside is that if AAPL stock trades below $125 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $125 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceDon't Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Until ESPN Is ""Fixed""7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketThe 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansThe postIs Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. Taps Head of Amazon Fire to Run Apple TV (AAPL);2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its Q1 financials in January, there was little said about Apple TV sales. The poor performance of AAPL's Other Products division - despiterecord setting Apple Watch sales- said it all. However, it looks as though AAPL is turning its focus once again to its often neglected set-top streamer.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThere's no word of new Apple TV hardware, but the company has made a big move. News just broke that the company hired the former head of rivalAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV to take over as marketing vice president for Apple TV.New Apple TV Hire Sends SignalsBloombergreported last night that AAPL has hired Timothy D. Twerdahl as thenew marketing VP for Apple TV. Any new hire for the position would be worth noting, but in this case the company's choice is very interesting.According toBloomberg, Twerdahl came to Apple by way of Amazon, where he headed up the very successful Fire TV unit. Snagging one of your primary competitors is always a bit of a coup, but in this case, Apple's hire has an even more compelling background. Prior to his work with the Fire TV, Twerdahl was an executive withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and a vice president overseeing consumer devices atRoku.In other words, the new Apple TV boss previously headed up the top two competing video streamers and had a senior position with the world's number one video streaming service. That's a pretty good hire and not one the company would make unless it's serious about goosing those sliding Apple TV sales.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialBloombergnotes that the previous head of Apple TV marketing is being moved to a role helping to lead AAPL's efforts in securing streaming content deals.Apple TV Needs the PushWhile AAPL's set-top streamer got a sales push with the release of the new fourth-generation Apple TV in 2015, it wasn't able to maintain that momentum. The Apple TV may have games and its own App Store, but unlike the competition, there's no 4K video support and AAPL's box carries a hefty price premium.Even though AAPL doubled its Apple TV sales compared to the previous year when it introduced the new Apple TV in 2015, it still fell short of Roku, Amazon Fire TV andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Chromecast in market share.AAPL lumps the Apple TV into its Other Products division and doesn't spike out sales numbers. However, in the company's Q1 earnings report, revenue for Other Products declined by 8% year-over-year. Considering that it had a record-setting quarter for Apple Watch sales - the other major product in that division - the numbers point toward poor holiday sales for the Apple TV.No New Apple TV Hardware, YetOf course, even poaching the competition's top guy and someone with the breadth of experience that APPL's new hire appears to have can only go so far without revamping the product.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?The current, nearly year and a half old, Apple TV carries a huge price premium. AAPL charges a minimum of $149 for its box - double the going rate for competing hardware from Amazon, Google and Roku - and despite the big dollars the Apple TV lacks 4K video support.AAPL was able to shrug that off in 2015 when 4K video was more bleeding edge, but consumers now expect the feature. New content to populate thatTV app hubApple has been showing off won't hurt, but job one for Twerdahl will be dealing with the hardware gap.There's no word on new Apple TV hardware, yet. But with a new VP in place, his predecessor focusing on acquiring additional content and sales continuing to slide, the pressure is on for AAPL to either cut prices or introduce a new, fifth-generation box. Or both.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Walt Disney Co (DIS) and Boeing Co (BA);2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are hovering right around breakeven this morning, as Wall Street frets over falling oil prices amid a global glut of supply. The American Petroleum Institute reported a 14.2 million barrel rise in global stockpiles yesterday, and the Energy Information Administration will release its weekly figures later this morning. At last check, crude oil futures were of 0.67% at $51.82 per barrel.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave dropped 0.1%, withS&P 500futures also lost 0.1% andNasdaq-100futures are flat.On the options front, volume returned to normal on Tuesday, with about 13.2 million calls and 13.1 million puts changing hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped to 0.70, but the 10-day moving average crept higher to a three-month high of 0.70.Turning to Tuesday's volume leaders,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) saw renewed call option interest after RBC Capital and MKM Partners issued bullish research notes. Meanwhile,Walt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) saw mixed options activity following its first-quarter earnings report andBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) was on the hook for dividend capture plays ahead of today's ex-dividend action.Facebook Inc (FB)The brokerage community was out in defense of FB stock yesterday.RBC Capital reiteratedits ""outperform"" rating and boosted its price target to $175 from $170 on what analyst Mark Mahaney called Facebook's ""wicked strong"" fourth-quarter results. Meanwhile,MKM Partners told investorsthat they should buy any post-earnings weakness in FB stock, noting that Facebook's ""valuation collapse is premature.""12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenWhile call volume has come down considerably from its pre-earnings highs, FB stock options traders remain largely bullish on the shares. In Tuesday's trading, some 365,000 contracts traded on FB, with calls accounting for 58% of the day's take - down from the 71%-73% range ahead of earnings, but up from the recent trend toward 51% of total volume since the report.Looking out to Feb options, FB traders have set their sights on the $135 and $140 strikes, with open interest arriving at 26,000 and 32,000 contracts, respectively. FB stock eclipsed $135 late last week before retreating to support near $130. Clearly, FB options traders are expecting a move higher, though a longer consolidation period may be needed.Walt Disney Co (DIS)IfWalt Disney's quarterly reporttold investors anything, it's that the Mouse's House remains in disarray. Earnings came in at $1.55 per share on revenue of $14.78 billion, compared to expectations for $1.49 per share on sales of $15.3 billion.Year-over-year comparisons were tough, given that the year-prior saw blockbusterStar Wars: The Force Awakensrake in $2 billion for Disney. However, ESPN remains an albatross around Disney's neck, as it was almost entirely to blame for an 11% drop in the company's cable operating income.DIS stock options traders were nonplussed heading into the event, as calls only eked out 54% of the more than 313,000 contracts traded on the shares. That said, the overall opinion among options traders remains bullish for DIS.Currently, the February/March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.58, with calls nearly doubling puts among options set to expire within the next two months. The March $115 strike is by far the most popular among DIS bulls, attracting nearly 28,000 contracts.Boeing Co (BA)Boeing stock made a rare appearance on the top ten most active options listing on Tuesday, with dividend capture strategies likely driving the bulk of yesterday's volume. BA stock trades ex-dividend today, with stockholders of record as of the close last night eligible for a quarterly dividend of $1.42 per share to be paid on March 3.Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Could Lose ANOTHER ShoeOverall, 244,000 contracts traded on BA, with calls gobbling up 96% of the day's take. Given that calls are a favorite for dividend capture strategies, it's a safe bet that most of this activity was related.But BA stock has been a hot topic for options traders outside of yesterday's dividend related activity. The shares recently hit an all-time high of $170 following a solid quarterly earnings report, andcould be headed higher once againafter profit taking runs its course.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe postWednesday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Walt Disney Co (DIS) and Boeing Co (BA)appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Apple Inc. (AAPL) Nears $100 Billion In Debt: What Does This Mean?;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few days after declaring its earnings,Apple Inc.(AAPL) raised $10 billion indebt. Similar to the bond sales done in the past, this will also be carried out in various tranches with maturities of up to 30 years.makeArticleAd();The bonds will include both fixed rate notes and floaters.Apple Raises Debt a Little Earlier Than UsualThere was nothing much to say about the new bond offering, and it was much like other papers sold by the company every year.However, this time, the company raised bonds a little earlier than the tradition, and it is now nearing $100 billion in debt, according to Evan Niu ofThe Motley Fool.Usually, these bond offerings are announced after the iPhone maker gives updates to its capital return program, which is conducted some time in April or May. However, the company needed to sell the bonds a little early this year due to various reasons. The California-based company started its ninth share repurchase program in the previous quarter, and total share repurchases came at $11 billion.This depleted its cash reserves, and totalcashat the end of the quarter came in at around $15.9 billion. This is the low end of the usual  range of $15 billion to $25 billion that the company keeps for operational and strategic needs, notes Niu.As the company uses debt for capital returns purposes, its total debt taken over the past five years has grown significantly large.By the end of 2016, the iPhone maker had $87.5 billion in long-term debt and commercial paper. With the recently-raised $10 billion, it will total somewhere around $97.5 billion. The debt has an investment-grade rating.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenHowever, in the future, Apple's credit rating profile may deteriorate with a rise in debt levels, notes Niu.Meanwhile, RBC Capital Market analyst Amit Daryanani advises investors to buy Apple stock, as the iPhone maker might increase its capital return to shareholders.RBC Capital Markets maintained its 'Outperform'rating.The analyst said that most investors are assuming that upside is somewhere around $140-$150 at present, but there could be an uptick in the stock on the back of higher capital allocations.""We believe the fundamental reality remains that AAPL's valuation is materially sub-par to what we anticipate its long-termrevenueand EPS potential,"" Daryanani says.On Monday, Apple shares closed up 0.95% at $131.53. Year to date, the stock is up more than 12%, while in the last year, it is up almost 39%.The postApple Inc.

Why Apple Inc.'s Profit Dropped Last Quarter;2/8/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) most recent quarter was quite good, with the   company delivering revenue and earnings per share ahead of   expectations, thanks in no small part to better-than-expected   iPhone revenue.Nevertheless, despite the better-than-anticipated financial   performance, the company's operating income dropped from $24.17   billion to $23.35 billion. Net income declined from $18.36   billion in the year prior to $17.89 billion.Apple's iPhone coupled with AirPods. Image source:     Apple.makeArticleAd();Apple is still raking in alotof cash -- most companies could only dream of generating roughly   $18 billion inannualnet income, let alone bring in that much in a single quarter --   but investors should pay attention when profit declines. Let's go   over the key factors that drove Apple's operating and net income   figures down year over year, even as the company achieved record   quarterly revenue.Lower gross profit marginApple saw its gross profit drop from $30.42 billion in the   prior-year period to $30.18 billion in the company's most recent   period. Although the company's revenue was up year over year,   cost of sales grew at a faster pace than revenue did, resulting   in a decline in gross profit margin.Apple did note on its most recent earnings call that in the   prior-year period, Apple's revenue ""included the benefit of a   one-off $548 million patent infringement payment."" Though not a   substantial part of Apple's $75 billion-plus in revenue in that   quarter, CFO Luca Maestri did say that this payment boosted gross   margin in the year-ago quarter by 40 basis points, or 0.4%.The gross-margin story isn't the only thing that drove Apple's   profits slightly lower year over year, though.Higher operating expensesGross profit margin is an important part of overall   profitability, but a company's operating expenses -- which   include product development costs as well as sales and marketing   costs -- are also key determinants of a company's   profitability.Though Apple only increased its sales, general, and   administrative expenses by just shy of $100 million year over   year, its research and development spending surged to $2.87   billion -- up more than $400 million from the roughly $2.4   billion the company spent in the prior-year period.Apple's operating expenses grew 9% from $6.25 billion in the   prior-year period to $6.82 billion in the most recent quarter.   Since operating-expense growth was greater than revenue growth,   which was approximately 3.3%, operating expenses became a larger   part of the company's revenue and thus negatively affected   operating profit margin.What does this mean for Apple investors?The key headwinds to Apple's operating profit right now seem   to be the company's continued increases in research and   development, coupled with slow revenue growth.It's probably not a good idea for the company to let up on its   research and development investments, as the investments made   today are what allow the company to have a chance of bringing   compelling new products to market tomorrow, potentially driving   revenue and profit increases over the long term.In the near to medium term, Apple's best bet of returning to   consistent operating profit growth is likely to be from faster   revenue growth. Hopes seem to be high that Apple's   next-generation iPhone models will drive a so-called ""super   cycle"" such as what the company enjoyed with the iPhone 6-series   of products beginning in late 2014.If that comes to pass, Apple could see significant   year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of its coming   fiscal year.Looking out longer term, though, it's hard to predict if and   how the company will deliver sustainable profit growth. Can the   company's core product categories do it? Or will the company need   to enter or create new product categories beyond the iPhone,   iPad, Mac, and services to support such growth?These are questions that will only be answered in time.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the King;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, e-commerce giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) released disappointing holiday sales figures that caused investors to question the firm and send AMZN stock down roughly 3%. While the company produced fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, the firm's revenue and future guidance figures came in below estimates.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazon's lacklusterearnings resultsmay have shocked the broader market, but investors would be wise to use AMZN stock's loss as a buying opportunity because shares of the company very rarely go on sale.Amazon has a lot of potential and its willingness to invest in the future makes it a great long-term bet. While AMZN stock is still expensive at just over $810 per share and a price-to-earnings ratio of 186, the firm's share price could make its way above $900 by the end of the year.AMZN Stock: Three Reasons to Keep the Miss in PerspectiveIt's never a good thing when a company misses revenue expectations and issues worse-than-expected forward guidance. However, it's important to take a look at why AMZN's fourth-quarter earnings shook out the way they did and whether it's a deal breaker for investors considering picking up Amazon stock.Some of the reason for the revenue miss can be explained by currency fluctuations, whichhurtthe retailer's revenue figures by around $558 million. Amazon is also adjusting to its fast-growing marketplace and the number of merchants that have joined the firm's ""fulfilled by Amazon"" program.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis has in-turn increased shipping costs, but the long-term benefits of the growing number of ""fulfilled by Amazon"" merchants outweigh the short-term negatives. It allows Amazon to offer its Prime members a greater selection of items and will likely help AMZN grab an even larger marketshare.Speaking of Amazon Prime, the loyalty program is another good reason for investors to get behind Amazon stock. Not only do Prime's subscription fees provide AMZN with a passive revenue stream, but the program helps bind people to its ecosystem.Prime has expanded to include benefits like dash-buttons, which allow people to reorder certain products at the click of a button, and movie and music streaming. Prime members who use all of Amazon's services are not only more likely to buy additional Amazon products like the firm's virtual assistant Alexa, but they will also shop at its website before considering rivals - even if it doesn't offer the lowest prices.AMZN is doing with retail whatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) did with technology: building a brand that people will continue to buy into because it is convenient and connected.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200However, while the company's dominance in retail is a big reason to buy AMZN stock, one of the most compelling elements of the firm's business is Amazon Web Services - the firm's cloud computing arm. The cloud computing space represents a huge area for growth as the industry is relatively new, but AWS has already become one of the largest players.AWS has been slowly making up a larger and larger percentage of Amazon's total sales, and the fourth quarter was no exception. The firm's cloud computing arm has been growing rapidly over the last year and as the industry continues to expand, investors can expect AWS to add to Amazon's bottom line in a larger and larger capacity.Bottom Line on Amazon StockAMZN stock's stumble last week has given investors an opening to add shares to their portfolios. While there was some weakness in the company's fourth-quarter results, the firm is on track to continue growing and Amazon stock will likely deliver outstanding gains in the year ahead.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AAPL and AMZN.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Gold Stocks That Will Shine Under TrumpThe post3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc.

The Most Cash That Apple, Inc. Has Ever Had;2/7/2017;"You'd think that after returning over $200 billion in cash to   investors through its capital return program over the past five   years, that there'd be a sizable dent inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) money mountain. You'd be wrong.To be clear, Apple's cash position would certainly be about   $200 billion more if it weren't for the program, but the fact   still stands that Apple generates so much cash that it simply   can't give that money back fast enough. Operating cash flow was   $65.8 billion in fiscal 2016, which ended in September. Even   after deducting $12.8 billion in capital expenditures, the Mac   maker enjoyed $53 billion in free cash flow -- leaving plenty to   cover the $12.2 billion paid out in dividends and dividend   equivalents and buying back $30 billion worth of stock. The same   is true for the most recent fiscal first quarter.Apple Store Pudong. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's the thing: It's also true for almost every year since   Apple started returning capital. Capital returns have exceeded   100% of free cash flow in only one fiscal year since the program   commenced (2014, and only by about 12%). The net result is that   despite the massive amounts of capital being returned, Apple now   has the most cash it's ever had on the balance sheet. For a   company that loves superlatives as much as Apple does, it's   almost surprising that it didn't point this out on last month's   earnings call.Cash is kingAs of the end of 2016, Apple was sitting on $246 billion in   total cash, which is the highest its cash position has ever been.   Even if you were to factor in debt, which is predominantly used   to fund the capital return program, and look at Apple's cash   position on a net basis, that's also the highest it's ever been.   Despite its best efforts to return as much as possible, Apple's   cash keeps marching higher. Gross cash and net cash begin to   diverge in 2013 when Apple starts taking on debt, but you can see   both are at all-time highs.Data source: SEC filings and author's calculations. Chart by     author. Calendar quarters shown.It's also true that Apple's cash is increasingly concentrated   abroad, as the debt is used as a way to avoid repatriation taxes.   At this point, 94% of Apple's total cash is held by foreign   subsidiaries. This figure was closer to 60% half a decade   ago.Data source: SEC filings and author's calculations. Chart by     author. Calendar quarters shown.What comes nextGiven this, combined with the fact that Apple is currently   reviewing its capital return plans and will give investors an   update in April, there seems to be plenty of room for Apple to   get even more aggressive if it wants to. When it launched the   capital return program, it finally acknowledged years of   criticisms that the company had way more cash than it would ever   conceivably need -- and it currently has about $60 billion more   (or about 50%) net cash than when it started capital returns.The curve ball is the practical limit on how much debt Apple   should take on. If the company can convince the Trump   administration to deliver on that repatriation holiday promise,   that could potentially pave the way for some type of massive   return or special dividend. Otherwise, that money mountain is   only getting bigger.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What Happens to Qualcomm Inc. if the NXP Deal Gets Killed?;2/7/2017;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) have plunged nearly 20% since the beginning of the   year due to a double whammy of bad news. First, the U.S. Federal   Trade Commission filed anantitrust lawsuitagainst the chipmaker, claiming that it  leveraged its   portfolio of critical wireless patents to push competitors out of   the market. Shortly afterwards,Applesued Qualcommfor allegedly withholding ""rebate"" payments for its use of   Qualcomm modems.But that was just the tip of the iceberg -- Qualcomm has been   struggling with other similar antitrust lawsuits across the world   over the past two years. It was fined $975 million and forced to   slash its licensing fees in China, fined another $854 million in   South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in additional fines   in Europe and Taiwan.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();However, the impacts of those fines and reduced licensing fees   are overshadowed by a much bigger long-term risk -- the potential   cancellation of its planned$47 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . Let's see what could happen to Qualcomm if this   massive deal gets derailed.A brief look at Qualcomm's problemsQualcomm has two main business units -- the chipmaking one   (QCT) and the licensing one (QTL). The QCT unit, which sells its   flagship Snapdragon mobile chips and baseband modems, generates   most of its revenue. The QTL unit, which owns a massive portfolio   of 3G/4G patents, generates most of its profits.Both businesses have been under pressure over the past few   years. The QCT unit has been losing market share to cheaper chips   from challengers likeMediaTekand first-party ARM chips from big OEMs like Apple,Huawei,Samsung, andXiaomi. The QTL unit is struggling with the aforementioned regulatory   scrutiny, since many OEMs consider its cut (up to  5%) of   the wholesale price of each smartphone sold to be too high.To offset those declines, Qualcomm is diversifying the QCT   business intoadjacent markets, with specialized Snapdragon chips for wearables, drones,   connected cars, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A   crucial part of this push is in the connected car, which is   widely considered a next-gen computing platform. To gain a   foothold in this market, Qualcomm acquired IoT and    automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion in 2015.Why Qualcomm needs NXPTo expand further, Qualcomm agreed to buy NXPin order to   also expand into new market -- namely automobiles. NXP became the   top automotive chipmaker in the world after its $12 billion   purchase of Freescale in late 2015. NXP also holds leading   positions in the networking and safety systems markets. Qualcomm   expects the combined company to generate annual revenues of over   $30 billion (compared to Qualcomm's estimated revenue of $23.8   billion this year), and help it establish leading positions   across the mobile, automotive, IoT, security, RF, and networking   markets.Qualcomm believes that the deal will grow its ""serviceable   addressable markets"" by about 40% to $138 billion in 2020, and   that the deal will be ""significantly accretive to non-GAAP   earnings immediately"" after it closes. It expects the deal to   generate $500 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies two   years after the deal closes.This deal will clearly help the QCT pivot away from the   sluggish smartphone market. But it will also greatly expand the   QTL's patent portfolio, which could enable Qualcomm to collect   licensing fees across a much wider range of industries.Why the deal could run into troubleThe FTC has already accused Qualcomm of charging competing   baseband modem makers higher license fees for its wireless   patents, which made their modems pricier for smartphone makers to   use. Therefore, the FTC is unlikely to approve a deal which could   give Qualcomm the same power over other growing markets like IoT   devices and connected cars.If the FTC lawsuit derails the NXP deal, Qualcomm will be left   with a fading QCT business and a potentially crippled QTL one --   which would cripple the chipmaker's long-term growth prospects.   Some analysts have speculated that Qualcomm might need to divest   some businesses or split in two (along the QCT and QTL lines) to   gain regulatory approval -- but splitting its low-margin and   high-margin businesses could yield unpredictable results.However, some analysts believe that the FTC will simply drop   the case, since Maureen Ohlhausen -- a Republican who was   recently appointed as the interim chairwoman by President Trump   -- previously expressed her  strong opposition to the   lawsuit. During last quarter's conference call, Qualcomm CEO   Steve Mollenkopf expressed confidence that the  deal would   close, and that recent legal actions were merely ""driven by   commercial disputes.""The key takeawayAs a Qualcomm investor, I'm disappointed with the recent legal   actions against the chipmaker. While those moves might force   Qualcomm to lower its licensing fees, I'm not convinced that they   will derail the NXP deal. The risks have certainly gone up for   Qualcomm, but I still believe that its forward P/E of 11 and 4%   forward yield could limit its downside potential.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tech Stock Roundup: Industry Comments on Visa Ban;2/7/2017;"The technology sector has grown increasingly dependent on foreign talent over the years such that today it can't function without it. On the face of things, this has been really good for innovation helping the U.S. maintain its technological lead over others. But digging down a bit deeper, what this means is that the U.S. is increasingly incapable of producing this talent itself. This is not a good situation to be in, particularly when you consider that countries like China are doing all they can to develop indigenous intellectual property.That's probably the reason President Trump's draft proposal according to Bloomberg reads as follows: ""Our country's immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest… Visa programs for foreign workers... should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers - our forgotten working people - and the jobs they hold.""There are many conflicting views and opinions about H-1B visas that companies use to employ people from other countries when adequate resources in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math aren't available locally. But since foreign labor is usually cheaper, critics say that companies tend to employ foreigners even when the skills are available thus depressing wages for the industry as a whole.Ron Hira, an associate professor at Howard University, has done extensive research on the topic. Supporters say there isn't room to control wage inflation since the program is highly regulated and technology companies like AmazonAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFT, in fact, pay handsomely.Whatever the opinion on the wage rate, there's no denying that the jobs go to foreigners. If the trend continues, high tech American employees will have a harder time finding jobs, thus gradually closing down the institutions producing them. The per capita GDP attributable to such jobs will also go down as tech employees from abroad obtain American citizenship.It's also true that a country is in a position of absorbing others, giving them a home, a job, etc. when it is itself in a position of strength. But when it can't find local tech workers, it's definitely not in that position and may need some temporary measures to rejuvenate.There's also another side to the story. If tech companies are unsuccessful in their letters of appeal, lawsuits and other measures they're taking against the President and the proposal is enforced, they may decide to employ the same talent in international facilities. A company's main motivation and objective is to generate profit, and there could be initial costs of setting up such international operations.The visa issue has been clubbed with another important one involving terrorism because the President has blocked all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days (the ban is indefinite for Syrian refugees possibly because of their acts of vandalism across Europe). Citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries like Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen were also banned from entering the U.S. for 90 days. This seems like a relatively short period of time and what will be achieved in the interim remains unclear.In the meantime, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, filed a complaint saying Trump's order is ""undermining the state's sovereign interests"" in violation of equal protection laws under the Fifth Amendment. Washington State also sued the President with support from Amazon and Microsoft.But don't imagine that the so-called refugees are helpless victims because they have plenty of powerful lobbies working for them. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are getting ready to file lawsuits. What's more, Google has created a ""crisis fund"" with $2 million and its employees have contributed a like amount that they are gifting the ACLU. Other funds are also on the way.But tech companies have plenty to say about both issues:Apple: CEO Tim Cook told employees that the company had communicated with the White House. ""I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued (Friday) restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support…Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,"" he wrote in an email.Google: CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo to employees: ""It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues…We've always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so."" He also said that at least 187 Google staff were affected by the ban.Founder Sergey Brin: ""It's a debate about fundamental values and thoughtful policymaking and many of the other things, I think, that are apparently not universally adored but I think the vast majority of our country and legislators support."" Google has a problem with the orders, including ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants. After planning their move for some days 2K+ Google employees from at least eight Google offices walked out on Monday afternoon.Facebook: Founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page: ""Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation."" In an official statement on Saturday, Facebook said: ""We are assessing the impact on our workforce and determining how best to protect our people and their families from any adverse effects.""IntelINTC: Brian Krzanich: ""I have heard from many of you, and share your concern over the recent executive order and want you to know this is not a policy we can support,"" and ""First, as the grandson of immigrants and the CEO of a company that was co-founded by an immigrant, we believe that lawful immigration is critical to the future of our company and this nation.""One of Intel's first hires was Andy Grove, who survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and ran Intel for 11 years establishing it as the leader in microprocessor technology. He also said: ""At Intel we believe that immigration is an important part of our diversity and inclusion efforts"" and ""Inclusion is about making everyone feel welcome and part of our community.""Its official statement says, ""We are providing support to potentially impacted employees, all of whom are in this country lawfully. As a company co-founded by an immigrant, we continue to support lawful immigration. We will continue to provide any impacted employees with Intel's full support.""A statement on the company website says that it supports ""legislative or administrative action to improve the immigration system for highly skilled employees."" Half its 106K employees work in other countries and its U.S. workers include roughly 3K foreigners on work visas for those with specialized skills. But the number of employees from the seven banned nations is not known. Intel explained its contribution to Trump's inaugural committee by saying that it gave Intel a seat at the table on issues important to the company.Microsoft: Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote in a letter to the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that there are currently 76 U.S. visa holders within the tech firm and 41 dependents who are citizens of the seven countries mentioned in the order. ""These are not situations that law-abiding individuals should be forced to confront when there is no evidence that they pose a security or safety threat to the United States,"" he said.Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, said, ""As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world"" while posting Smith's email to employees on LinkedIn. Microsoft is trying everything to keep its options open. On the one hand it is joining Washington state to sue Trump while on the other, it is requesting the government to make an exception for ""responsible known travelers with pressing needs"" so people with passports from one of the countries listed in the order can return to the U.S. as long as they have a valid work or student visa and have not committed a crime in the U.S.Micorsoft is also asking that employees and students affected by the ban be allowed to travel outside of the U.S. for business reasons, except to the seven countries on the list. It is also asking that people with passports from one of the countries be allowed to go home for family reasons on a case-by-case basis.Tesla: CEO Elon Musk, one of only a few tech executives on Trump's business advisory team and manufacturing jobs initiative: ""The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges,"" he tweeted on Saturday. ""Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected.""TwitterTWTRCEO Jack Dorsey called the impact of the order ""real and upsetting.""Netflix: CEO Reed Hastings said, ""Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all… It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.""UberCEO Travis Kalanick told employees he would talk to Trump about it in President Trump's first business advisory group meeting. ""While every government has their own immigration controls, allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.'s policy since its founding. That means this ban will impact many innocent people,"" Kalanick said.BoxCEO Aaron Levie who is Iranian-American said ""At the corporate level, we are trying to take inventory on who could be impacted and ensuring that they stay within the country for now... We are really just getting a handle on the legal side of the situation, what we can fight and ultimately how we protect employees in the process."" More broadly, the order sends ""the wrong moral message to the world and within our own country,"" Levie said. ""It's very unfortunate and very disappointing.""SlackCEO Stewart Butterfield said ""Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit, but that doesn't matter: do the right thing because it's right,"" he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. ""My grandfather came from Poland between the wars, at 17, sponsored by an elder sister. Two more siblings made it. Everyone else died.""Sam Altman, president of Silicon Valley tech incubator Y Combinator said in a blog: ""It is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump's administration... The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers-if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.""CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+5.85%+20.10%FB-0.98%+5.29%GOOGL-2.95%+2.39%MSFT-3.22%+12.51%INTC-3.83%+4.79%CSCO+1.10%+1.92%AMZN-3.06%+5.53%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateApple in India: Apple will be assembling some iPhones in Bengaluru, the capital city of the south Indian state of Karnataka according to the state's IT minister Priyank Kharge. Taiwan's Wistron is setting up the unit that is expected to commence operations in the first half of 2017 (or by April-end according to some news sites).Apple has been trying to get concessions from the Indian government but progress on that front is not clear as of now. India is an important market for Apple, which sold 2.5 million iPhones in the country in 2016. An estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold in India by 2020, so one can understand why Apple CEO Tim Cook said that India is ""the place to be.""Apple Manufacturing In U.S.: Terry Gou, CEO of Apple's largest contractor Foxconn, has said that the company, along with top customer Apple, is considering the setting up of a display panel manufacturing unit in the U.S. that could create up to 50K jobs. The decision followed Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son's announcement about a $50 billion investment fund for the U.S.The Nikkei reported that another Pennsylvania plant was also in the works, but it would be involved in molding functions.  Foxconn-controlled Smart Technologies may also move production to the U.S. if President Trump is able to renegotiate the North American free trade agreement.Barclays Downgrades Apple: Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz doesn't have high expectations of the iPhone 8 because the maturing of the smartphone market means fewer upgrades and a tendency to buy lower-priced, older models. He also believes that ""long-term growth opportunities related to India, services, the enterprise, artificial intelligence, and maybe even the cloud still exist;"" however, he does not ""expect these potential 'what's next?' opportunities to emerge as major needle movers over the next 12 months for Apple's model.""  He therefore downgraded the shares from overweight to sector weight.Ford Snaps Up Apple Executive: Musa Tariq, Apple's global marketing and communications director for retail, is joining Ford as its chief brand officer. Tariq's experience includes initiatives to enhance the retail experience at Apple's 490 stores. As Ford evolves as a company making vehicles in a self-driving world, it will be increasingly blending technology and auto, so it's easy to see that the brand might need repositioning. Steering the company through these changes seems to be the role Tariq will play.Ajit Pai Is FCC Chairman: Net neutrality opposer Ajit Pai has been appointed Chairman of the FCC by the Trump administration. Pai was one of two Republicans on the five-member board, so his elevation won't require senate approval. He replaces Tom Wheeler, who resigned soon after Trump won the elections. Streaming companies like Netflix, Apple and Amazon won't be too pleased although Netflix indicated that its fan following provided it a certain amount of leverage with carriers. The truth is, it already has arrangements with carriers that allow them to charge it differential rates, contrary to the principles of net neutrality.Facebook Gets New VR Chief: Facebook has made an important hire in Hugo Barra, who has spent the last three years revving up the marketing machinery at Xiaomi (the success of the Mi3 and Redmi smartphones are attributed to him) and serving as Google's Android chief before that. Facebook's VR plan is more on the high end, which has somewhat impacted the adoption of the Rift, so it's easy to see how it could benefit from experience.Barra will replace Brendan Iribe as Oculus head and will also head up all VR efforts at Facebook. Iribe will move to the PC division, to speed up PC-based VR development. As part of his recent testimony defending Oculus technology, Zuckerberg said earlier that VR will take five to ten years to go mainstream and that Facebook will probably have to spend another $3 billion before it gets where it wants to go. So it clearly has long range plans.Microsoft to Invest $1 Billion in Cloud Security: Microsoft has said that it will continue to invest a billion dollars into cloud security over the next few years and some say this is excluding acquisitions (such as Aorato for enterprise security, Adallom for general cloud security applications, and Secure Islands, for protection of data and files) and investments through its venture capital arm.The adoption of cloud infrastructure by enterprises to a great extent hinges on the security of offerings. This along with the far greater competition in the cloud than in desktop computing makes security very important for Microsoft. Since the company now has a synchronized operating system across platforms in windows 10, it can hope to bring increasingly secure offerings and thereby pick up market share.Microsoft Bond Sale: Soon after raising $19.75 billion in bonds in Aug 2016, Microsoft sold another $17 billion worth. The seven-part offering will be used for general corporate purposes and to help repay $26 billion in short term debt used to acquire LinkedIn.Moody's assigned a Aaa rating to the issue on the basis of a business model that will remain exceptionally robust as it continues to transition from on premise licensing to cloud based software subscription and service offerings. Investors haven't taken bond issues by tech companies badly because it's well known that they have huge cash piles parked overseas. The practice may change going forward if tax reform brings more of this cash back home.Microsoft Creates CTO Position: Kevin Scott, former SVP of infrastructure and operations at LinkedIn, will fill the newly created position of chief technology officer at Microsoft to push adoption of Microsoft products and services at LinkedIn customers and members. He will report directly to CEO Nadella. Scott previously worked at Google and AdMob.Nadella Joins Starbucks Board: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will join Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer and LEGO Brand Group executive chairman Jørgen Vig Knudstorp on Starbucks' board of directors, if the shareholders approve the appointments at the annual general meeting in March. The appointments will expand the size of the board from 12 to 14 as long-time director Jamie Shennan will retire before the meeting.Snap IPO Reveals Google Cloud Deal: Inside documents filed by Snap was a deal with Google to use its cloud computing platform to run the Snapchat app; not just that, there is a minimum purchase agreement of $400 million a year, although in the first four years, up to 15% may be moved to a subsequent year. Snap doesn't make a whole lot of money just yet, (just $404.5 million in 2016) but its service is very popular and using Google's cloud could help it scale.Google Is Top Brand Again: Brand Finance, one of the firms providing a list of leading brands, says that Google has claimed the top position for the first time in 5 years, replacing Apple. Google's strength is seen in its prowess in search, which is the mainstay of its advertising business and where it remains ""largely unchallenged"". Apple is seen as repeatedly underperforming expectations and its inability to ""demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline"".Google Hires VR Employee: Just a few months after Google launched its Daydream View VR headset (basic features and head strap packed into a stylish package that retails for just $49), the company has hired away Claude Zellweger, who headed HTC's VR unit. Zellweger led the team responsible for the Vive VR headset, so this is probably an indication that Google has big VR hardware plans.Alibaba Leading Funding Round in India's Paytm: Alibaba is leading a $200 million funding round in Paytm Ecommerce, which was spun out of One97 Communications. One97 also offers the Paytm Digital Wallet, in which Alibaba and its financial arm own a high stake. Alibaba is not entering the Indian ecommerce market directly at this stage but through startups like this one and Snapdeal. Other big players include Amazon and Flipkart.Activision's Consumer Products Division: Activision has created a division to make more out of its popular video games and has appointed Tim Kilpin former president and chief commercial officer of Mattel, to head the unit. Activision's goal is to develop consumer-type products based on its video game franchises (toys and apparel for example) so Kilpin, with his experience developing the hugely popular ""Monster High"" dolls (Mattel's first intellectual property in more than 30 years) will come in handy.Legal/RegulatoryFacebook Fined in Oculus Case: A jury has decided that ZeniMax will receive $500 million from Oculus owner Facebook as it was guilty of copyright infringement, the failure to comply with a non-disclosure agreement, and for the misuse of Oculus trademarks. The amount to be paid is split up as follows: $200 million for violating a non-disclosure agreement, $50 million for copyright infringement and $50 million for improper use of ZeniMax trademarks.It will also pick up $150 million in damages from Brendan Iribe and $50 million in damages from Palmer Luckey, the two Oculus co-founders. However, the court ruled that the Rift maker wasn't guilty of trade secret theft, a point that will be used by Oculus to frame its appeal.Google Privacy Policy Under EU Scrutiny: Google made a significant change to its privacy policy back in June. The change, while enabling users to more easily see and delete the information that Google has on them, also alters Google's age-old policy to separate data on Gmail and YouTube from its widely used DoubleClick business. The change therefore empowers Google to build better customer profiles and thereby serve more targeted ads. Oracle, which is part of a coalition called Fairsearch that tries to make life as difficult as possible for Google, brought it to the attention of regulators last year and they are now looking into the matter.Amazon Would Rather Settle with EU: Amazon's parity clause that forced ebook publishers to always offer it the same terms as rival platforms has been under EU scrutiny. The investigation started in Jun 2015 with the goal of determining whether the facility prevented other distributors from competing with Amazon by offering new and innovative products and services. Now that the EU has opened it up for feedback from rivals and customers, Amazon is attempting to settle the matter with publishers so it isn't called upon to pay a fine, which could be as high as 10% of its global turnover.New Technology/ProductsApple Watch Patent: Apple has won a patent for a modular metal band for its Watch. The modules can be used to house batteries, haptic devices that provide a sensation to the user, displays, photovoltaic cells, cameras, GPS sensors, speakers and a range of health sensors including thermometers, hygrometers, blood pressure sensors and sweat sensors. The limited space in the wearable to serve individual customer needs was the reason for developing the band.Apple Mac Chip Could Hurt Intel Business: Both Boomberg's Mark Gurman and Ian King and RBC analyst Amit Daryanani have given views on how an Apple developed co-processor(codenamed T310 for Macs based on ARM technology can hurt Intel's chip business. According to Bloomberg, the Apple chip, which went into development last year, will gradually take over the functions of the Intel processor, paving the way for Apple's processor independence.But chips generally take 3-4 years to get into mass production, so Daryanani's view that it will not impact Intel's business in 2017 and also possibly in 2018 makes sense. He says that if Intel is totally designed out, it will be a $2-3 billion hit to annual revenue, $750 million to $1 billion hit to operating income with a 12-16 cent impact on the annual EPS.Intel Go: Intel is boosting its automotive efforts by creating a new division called Intel Go to solve hardware problems like computer vision, infotainment, 5G wireless connectivity and AI technology. It will also offer related software solutions. Intel holds the view that the car is the next computing hub and it intends to do all it can to grab a greater dollar share. As cars incorporate more electronics and move towards complete automation, Intel's innovations, partnerships and investments may be expected to put it in front and center of the new opportunity as it unfolds.Google Instant Apps: First announced at the 2016 Google I/O conference, Instant Apps are a workaround between full apps and the web. Single-use or infrequently-used apps sometimes have to be downloaded because the mobile web browsers of companies aren't that great. Since unnecessary downloads are nothing but wasted memory and space, Google will stream parts of the apps from its own servers, so neither the download nor the mobile web is required. The company is now rolling out the service to select users.Slack's Answer to Microsoft: The Slack Enterprise Grid designed for larger and more complex businesses offers identity management technology, data loss prevention and advanced security systems. The Slack solution is also compliant with regulatory requirements in healthcare and finance sectors, which may be partly responsible for its swelling user base.The company said that it now has 1.5 million paying users, which is commendable since it doesn't offer many other computing building blocks that rival Microsoft does. In Nov 2016, Microsoft announced Teams, which connected the chat feature with the Office 365 cloud suite, thereby facilitating collaboration. The two are now competing head-on.M&A and CollaborationsCisco Buys AppDynamics: Cisco paid $3.7 billion for AppDynamics, an application performance management company just before it was scheduled to float its IPO. The purchase price was more than double the amount the company hoped to raise at its IPO and almost double the $1.9 billion valuation at its last funding round. Cisco has been trying to build the software and services side of the business, with particular focus on the emerging Internet of Things. The acquisition will surely provide the ""end to end visibility and intelligence from the network through the application"" that it is looking for and could nudge up software revenue from the current 29%, but the price tag looks high.Alibaba Affiliate Buys MoneyGram: Alibaba's payments arm Ant Financial is buying Nasdaq-listed MoneyGram for $880 million. MoneyGram focuses on peer-to-peer transactions and includes cross-border currency transfers. It also claims to have 350K physical locations across 200 countries. Ant Financial handles nearly 90% of digital payments in China and has also made strategic investments in India-based Paytm as part of its international push. MoneyGram will go a long way in furthering this objective.Some NumbersApple Watch Market Share: According to Strategy Anlaytics, Apple sold 5.2 million Apple Watch devices in the fourth quarter of 2016, slightly higher than 5.2 million units in the year-ago quarter, grabbing a 63% share of the market. Samsung was second with a 10% share, or 800K units (it sold 1.3 million units a year ago).Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Apple Inc.'s Mac Is Back on Track;2/7/2017;"For a while there,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac business was really struggling. Not only was   it a victim of a generally weak personal-computer market, but a   stale product line in the face of aggressive moves from competing   computer vendors also led the company to underperform the broader   market.Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();That, by the way, is a nice way of saying the company lost   market share.Last October, though, Applefinallylaunched new MacBook Pro machines. It updated both its 13-inch   and 15-inch MacBook Pro lines, and because of all the new   features it packed into these updated systems, the company   charged higher prices for them than it did for the   prior-generation models.Now that Apple's first-quarter financial results are out --   the first quarter in which the company would recognize revenue   for the new systems -- investors can get an idea of how well   customers have received the new systems.And, perhaps unsurprisingly, things are looking good.Putting Mac back on a growth pathApple reported shipping 5.37 million Macs in the first quarter   of its fiscal year 2017, netting $7.24 billion in revenue from   those sales. Mac unit shipments were up from the 5.31 million   Apple shipped in the prior-year period, amounting to 1.1%   growth.That's not a huge amount of growth, but considering the 10%   unit decline that Apple's Mac business suffered last year, that's   an improvement.Though unit growth was positive but anemic, the revenue growth   story was completely different. Apple's Mac revenue in its most   recent quarter was up 7% year over year, implying a solid   increase in Mac average selling prices.""The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest   quarterly revenue ever,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook proclaimed on the   company's first-quarter earnings call.It's still early in the current MacBook Pro product cycle, but   it seems customers were willing to pay extra for the added   features and technologies Apple added to its latest MacBook Pro   machines.Apple knows what it must doI'd hazard a guess that it won't take any miracles or   game-changing innovations to allow Apple's Mac product line to   continue to at least perform in line with the personal-computer   market. Apple simply needs to make sure it provides regular   updates to its Mac products so the lineup doesn't get stale.These regular updates can be as simple as adopting the latest   processors and adding other technological improvements, though   obviously the bigger and more interesting the changes -- think   the Touch Bar, the Force Touch trackpad, and so on -- the   better.The Mac doesn't make up a huge portion of Apple's annual   revenue. Mac sales made up less than 10% of Apple's fiscal   first-quarter revenue, though this percentage is bound to   increase as Apple moves past the peak iPhone quarter. And when   taken in conjunction with Apple's other non-iPhone products, it's   still a reasonable contributor to revenue.Further, much has been said about the strength of Apple's   ecosystem and the company's ability to build products that work   well together. If the company can sell more Macs, then that might   also translate into customers who will switch to -- or stick with   -- Apple's iPhone.Apple should do its very best to make sure all of the elements   of its ecosystem are strong, to maximize the potential value it   can extract from said ecosystem.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Mutual Funds to Buy on Apple's Robust Earnings;2/7/2017;"The tech sector has performed favorably in recent times on the back of encouraging earnings results.Although Trump's proposed trade and immigration policies are expected to weigh on big technology companies, hiscorporate tax repatriation planscould benefit technology companies that hold a lot of cash overseas. These tech companies could repatriate that cash and use it for investments, dividends and buybacks.Tech behemoth Apple IncAAPLmade a strong rebound on the back of strong fiscal first-quarter earnings results. The good show was driven by impressive iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales. Following these promising trends, investing in technology mutual funds with a significant holding in the iPhone maker and other tech giants will be a prudent decision.Q1 Earnings in FocusApple's fiscal first-quarter earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3% respectively. Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year to nearly $7.2 billion.Additionally, total iPhone unit sales came in at about $78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue). Moreover, optimism of the tech behemoth's forthcoming series of iPhone upgrades in the coming months encouraged some analysts to raise their price targets.Apple Rally Boosts Tech SectorGains in Apple came as a breather for the broader technology sector. The iPhone maker remained the biggest company in the index in terms of market capitalization. Along with Apple some other big tech companies like MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGL, NetflixNFLXand FacebookFBreported solid earnings results.Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) and revenues for fiscal Q2 beat our estimates, while Alphabet reported higher-than-expected revenues for the Q4. Both Netflix's and Facebook's top and bottom line for the Q4 beat our respective estimates.For the overall Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 84% of the sector's total market cap.Total earningsfor these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues, with 71.1% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates.In the past three months, the tech sector jumped 9.8%, remaining one of the best performers among the S&P 500 sectors. In the last one month, the tech sector rose 2.7%, way above the S&P 500's gain of 0.7%. Additionally, mutual funds related to this sector registered strong returns.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.Click here to find out which 9 other ETFs had   notable inflows »"

Here's How Apple Inc. Plans On Doubling Services Revenue Over 4 Years;2/7/2017;"If you've been paying close attention, you'll notice thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been very conscientiously trying to shift   investor focus away from things like iPhone unit sales in favor   of recurring revenue sources like services.That's why the iPhone maker even introduced a non-GAAP metric   for installed base-related purchases in early 2016, only tostop reporting itjust a few quarters later (likely due to the SEC cracking down on   companies abusing non-GAAP metrics). The iPhone sold rather well   over the holiday quarter, setting a fresh quarterly record, but   Apple is still very much wanting investors to better appreciate   its services business.iCloud. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();For 2016, Apple's services revenue hit a new milestone,   crossing $25 billion in revenue for the first time. Services   should even be large enough to be a stand-alone Fortune 100   company in 2017. Not one to rest on its laurels, Apple is   ambitiously hoping todoubleservices revenue over the next four years.150 million subscriptions and countingOn the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted that Apple now bills   over 150 million paid subscriptions through the various content   platforms that it operates. That includes both Apple's own   services as well as third-party subscriptions. This is a new   metric that Apple has not disclosed previously, and it will be   important to see this number grow (if Apple continues providing   updates, that is). There was no update on how many Apple Music   subscribers the company now has, but the most recent update from   December was 20 million.Apple Music. Image source: Apple.More color surrounding these subscriptions would go a long way   toward analyzing the services business. I have no shortage of   questions. Are those 150 million subscriptions all discrete   users, or are there multiple subscriptions per user? What's the   average monthly recurring amount? What categories (such as video,   audio, or other) are seeing the most interest? Has there been any   uplift from thereduced 15% cuton long-term (longer than one year) subscriptions? Many   enterprise-oriented apps utilize subscription models; how much is   the enterprise contributing to subscriptions?When asked how Apple will get to its goal, CFO Luca Maestri   did add some additional detail:And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that     the number of people that are transacting on our stores is     increasing strong double digits, and we're also seeing that the     [average revenue per user] per paying customer is increasing     double digits, right? So it's a combination of the two,     obviously the quality and the quantity of content that we make     available in our services improves all the time. And we also     see that as people getting to the platform and start     transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their     behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend     more and more over time.Interestingly, Maestri also noted that iCloud storage and   AppleCare are growing ""very well"" and are at all-time highs as   well. Apple last cut iCloud storage prices in late 2015, making   the service more competitive with rivals (iCloud storage used to   be overpriced). Meanwhile, services like iCloud Photo Library   increase the need for cloud storage. On the AppleCare front, more   customers tend to buy Apple's extended warranty when newly   designed products come out due to the higher initial repair   costs, and those new MacBook Pros with Touch Bars are both new   and pricey.Take what you can getHere's another way to look at it: Product sales are unlikely   to be major growth drivers at this point since the businesses are   already so large. The only new product that could theoretically   start taking off is Apple Watch, but we know the smartwatch   market is in the dumps and Apple still aggregates its wearable in   the ""Other Products"" segment. It's unlikely that Apple Watch will   suddenly become a $25 billion business within the next couple of   years (the entire Other Products segment is under $11   billion).If total revenue remains relatively flat, but services can add   another $25 billion in sales over the next few years, that would   represent over 10% growth.

Biometrics And Payments: Companies Are Using Your Fingerprints For Cybersecurity;2/7/2017;"The endless catalog of alphanumeric passwords, pins numbers, and rising online security breaches and frauds is one of the harsh realities of the digital payment ecosystem. In order to strengthen the security of transaction mechanisms while retaining convenience, the payments industry is fast exploring alternative methods, biometrics being one of them.Biometrics is a unique way of identifying a person using biological traits such as fingerprints, hand geometry, DNA, IRIS scan, voice waves, and facial recognition.With its unique ability to reduce rejection rates of authentication, combat cybersecurity threats, overcome user disdain for stronger passwords and provide a smoother user experience, more and more companies are embracing the use of biometrics to add an extra layer of safety to their operations.makeArticleAd();According to astudy, biometrics is fast becoming a part of consumer lives with approximately 190 million mobile devices (smartphones and wearables) enabled with some form of biometrics as of 2016 and such installation is projected to exceed 600 million devices by 2021.It is furtherestimatedthat there will be 770 million biometric authentication apps downloaded annually by 2019. These figures highlight the growth in the biometric technology, its market size, and adoption rate.The biometrics market isexpectedto reach more than $30 billion by 2021, backed by a boost from consumer electronics, particularly smartphones. According to areportby PricewaterhouseCoopers, ‘biometrics and advanced authentication’ lists among the top five cybersecurity spending priorities for the next 12 months.Here’s a look at some of the companies in the payments industry which have adopted some form of biometrics.Apple, Inc. (AAPL)has been a trendsetter of fingerprint scanners for authentication since 2013. ItsTouch IDis now available across itsdevicesfor making payments via ApplePay. In fact, areportpoints out that Apple Pay will “push the number of biometrically authenticated transactions to nearly 5 billion by 2019, up from less than 130 million in 2015.”One of the recentpatentsgranted to Apple pertains “to capacitive fingerprint sensing systems, and more particularly to the use of an electrostatic lens to increase the resolution of a capacitive sensing system.”Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (SSNLF)provides an alternative to the traditional password with Samsung Pass. WithSamsung Pass, instead of less-secure passwords, users are offered to use a fingerprint scan or iris scan for authentication purposes. Samsung Pay offers fingerprint authentication and is working on NextG biometric sensors to make Samsung Pay and its devices more secure.A 2016studybyVisa, Inc. (V)in Europe reveals that “two-thirds of consumers want to use biometrics when making payments while three-quarters see two-factor authentication, where a form of biometrics is used in conjunction with a payment device, as secure.” Back in September 2015, VisaintroducedEMV Chip-based biometrics trial to allow cardholders to use fingerprint readers in lieu of passwords at ATMs owned by South Africa’s Absa Bank.In October 2016,MasterCard Incorporation (MA)launchedan exciting pilot project to boost the security of transactions at checkout counters in stores by using facial recognition by simply taking a ‘selfie’ to authenticate payments. In case of a web store, the authentication is done via finger scan or selfie recognition.PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)made its first move into the biometric space in 2014 when itcollaboratedwith Samsung Galaxy to be able to pay on mobile and in-store using fingerprints. In 2016, Lenovo partnered with PayPal, Intel and Synaptics to secure online transactions with a finger touch. PayPal in the App Store also supports Touch ID authentication.Alipaythe world’s largest third-party platform operated byAnt Financial Services Groupthat had spun-off from Alibaba(BABA)in 2011 began toprovidefacial recognition as a simpler and more secure login method to its customers in December 2015. Last year, Ant Financial Services Group announced the acquisition of EyeVerify, “the creator of Eyeprint ID, a patented, secure mobile eye verification technology.” Theaccuracyprovided by Eyeprint ID’s is 99.99%, the same as Touch ID. In January 2017, Ant Financial announced of its acquisition of MoneyGram International, Inc. (MGI).Final WordGiven the fact that people are complacent with easy and repeated passwords, the job for digital hackers has become easier, making it harder for service providers to provide security. Areportby Verizon points out that “63% of confirmed data breaches involved leveraging weak, default or stolen passwords.” In such a scenario, biometrics emerges as a technology that not just offers ease and lower costs, it works well as an identification and security method, especially when used with another layer of authentication."
Fretting over Trump's Policies? 5 Safe Value Bets;2/7/2017;"Though the earnings season is at its peak, President Donald Trump has been keeping investors busy elsewhere. Investors keenly await clarification on the timing and scope of Trump's business-friendly policies and how the administration will balance tax cuts and infrastructure outlays with protectionist trade policies. The President has also acted promptly on executive orders ranging from a temporary immigration ban to the withdrawal from landmark trade pacts.Investors, in the meantime, also assign greater risk premiums to European countries where anti-establishment movements are gaining traction ahead of elections. Amid such apprehensions, it will be wise to invest in value stocks. Value investors look for times of uncertainty to pick stocks at a discount, which are fundamentally stable.Travel Ban Triggers UncertaintyTrump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban. German chancellor Angela Merkel said that it is ""not justified to put people from a specific background or faith under general suspicion"", while French president Francois Hollande said that ""withdrawal into oneself is a dead-end response"".Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Such an executive order on immigration, widely known as the ""Muslim Ban"", is being met with resistance by an increasing number of major tech firms.Tech giants Microsoft CorporationMSFTand Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNhave taken legal action against the executive order as they face obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Tim Cook, Apple Inc.'sAAPLCEO in an email sent to staff said that Trump's order ""is not a policy we support"". He added that ""diversity makes our team stronger"". In fact, 97 tech giants including Alphabet IncGOOGL, Facebook IncFBand Netflix, Inc.NFLXfiled a joint legal brief in protest of Trump's immigration ban.Alphabet, promptly, created a $2 million crisis fund for four campaigning organizations such as American Civil Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, International Rescue Committee and UNHCR, while Sundar Pichai its CEO said that ""it's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues"".Trade War Could Hit EconomyInvestors, in the meanwhile, may ignore Trump's trade rhetoric at their own peril. The administration's pledge to protect U.S. industries and redefine currency relationships could lead to a trade war with dire consequences, eventually sparking a sell-off. In order to put ""America First"", Trump may retreat from global trade sending exporter's currency plummeting, curbing corporate revenues and destroying consumption.Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and is mulling over the imposition of a border tax on imports. The administration had accused China, Mexico, Germany and Japan of keeping their currencies weak to gain trade advantages, which is irking even those who were bullish after the election.Caution Spreads Amid Geopolitical RisksWhile a highly polarized political environment and Trump's confrontational approach are expected to fuel volatility in the market, investors are also preparing for political upheavals across Europe including French and German elections later this year.French Socialist Member of Parliament and supporters have started to break ranks with their party after the primary election win of leftwing presidential nominee Benoît Hamon, offering support to independent candidate Emmanuel Macron. In Germany, Martin Schulz is to run as the Social Democrat candidate for chancellor after Sigmar Gabriel turned down the chance to oppose Angela Merkel in parliamentary election.5 Top Value Stocks to Buy NowIn a sign of how large the President's policies loom over the market, an analysis of FactSet data shows that one out of four companies were anxious about Trump's policies during their most recent earnings conference calls. Add to this more political disorder across Europe and we all know why investing in value stocks is judicious.Value investors look at uncertain times as opportunities to pick up financial sound stocks at a discount.  Such companies are well-established to do business even in the worst of times and are protected against market vagaries.Successful investors like Warren Buffett also recommend choosing stocks that are momentarily underpriced compared to the underlying value of the company, especially in an investment climate marked by skeptical investor behavior.Thanks to our newstyle score system, we have been able to identify five solid value stocks.

Don’t Miss the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Rally!;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you missed out on the post-earnings rally forAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA), your chance has come back around again. After rallying to $105 following arecord-breaking earnings report, Alibaba stock has pulled back to the psychologically significant $100 area, marking a prime entry point for a long position as BABA eyes all-time highs.makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeAlibaba stock has spent the past several sessions consolidating into the $100 region, helping the shares to blow off an overbought condition.Not only is $100 home to key technical and sentiment support, BABA's 20-day moving average is also rising into the area, providing an additional springboard for the shares.As for sentiment, Wall Street remains widely bullish on Alibaba stock. According to data from Thomson/First Call, analysts have doled out just five ""hold"" ratings compared to 37 ""buy"" or better ratings. Additionally, the 12-month consensus price target of $125.19 represents a roughly 25% premium to Monday's close.Short sellers, however, aren't so keen on Alibaba stock. During the most recent reporting period, the number of BABA shares sold short rose by 4% to 114 million shares, or roughly 10.5% of the stock's total float. As Alibaba stock rallies off support at $100, these shorts may be forced to buy back their bets, thus adding fuel to the fire for BABA shares.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterThat said, short sellers may be a bit nervous right now, if BABA's options activity is any indication. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio for Alibaba stock rests at 0.61, with calls nearly doubling puts among options set to expire within the next two months. In other words, either BABA call traders are betting on a continued rally, or short sellers are hedging their bets with purchased calls. Either way, this high degree of call OI is a bullish indicator for Alibaba stock.2 Trades for Alibaba StockCall Spread:For those looking to bet on a Alibaba stock bounce from $100, a March $105/$110 bull call spread has some impressive profit potential. At last check, this spread was offered at 94 cents, or $94 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $105.94, while a maximum profit of $4.06, or $406 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alibaba stock trades at or above $110 when March options expire next month.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200Put Sell:If a more neutral positions suits your trading style more, then a BABA March $97.50 put sell position has a solid chance at finishing out of the money. At last check, this put was bid at $1.44, or $144 per contract. Remember that you keep the initial premium received as long as Alibaba stock closes above $97.50 when March options expire. However, if BABA trades below $97.50 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares of BABA stock for every put sold at a cost of $97.50 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.9910 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe postDon't Miss the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Rally!appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Apple Inc. Talks iPhone Upgrade Rate;2/7/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 6s product line, launched in September   2015, ultimately underperformed the company's wildly successful   iPhone 6 product line in terms of sales. A key reason for this,   Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors at the time, was due to the   company's seeing fewer customers opting to upgrade their iPhones   during the iPhone 6s cycle than it did during the iPhone 6   cycle.""From an upgrade perspective, during the first half of [fiscal   2016], the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly   higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years   ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we   saw with iPhone 6,"" Cook explained back on the company's April   2016 earnings call.Apple iPhones. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();On Apple's most recent earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri   provided some insight into what the upgrade rate is looking like   for the current iPhone 7 product cycle -- let's take a closer   look.More of the same, but that's not badMaestri explained that the percentage of Apple's iPhone   installed base that has upgraded to the company's latest iPhone   7-series smartphones ""has been very similar to"" what the company   saw with the prior-generation iPhone 6s-series smartphones.Although last year's iPhone 6s cycle proved to be a bit   disappointing, this news is much better delivered this time   around than it was last year for several reasons.First, Apple's iPhone installed base has likely grown year   over year, so a constant upgrade rate applied to a larger   installed base should mean that more phones get sold -- clearly a   positive for Apple.Next, investors often focus on year-over-year trends. Last   year, the upgrade rate that Apple saw with the iPhone 6s relative   to the iPhone 6 negatively affected the company's financial   results year over year. This year, a flat upgrade rate relative   to the prior generation means that the year-over-year financial   result comparisons won't be as tough.And, finally, while the percentage of the iPhone installed   base that migrates to the latest iPhones might be flat generation   over generation, Apple seems to be getting a boost by selling a   richer product mix.As I notedhere, Cook told investors that the company is selling more iPhone 7   Plus phones as a percentage of total iPhone 7-series (i.e., ""new   product"") sales than it did of its prior-generation iPhone 6 Plus   or iPhone 6s Plus. The Plus models are more expensive than their   non-Plus counterparts, so this is a positive for Apple's iPhone   product mix and, ultimately, revenue.Can Apple accelerate that rate in the future?Maestri offered some additional insight into the factors that   impact the upgrade rates of Apple's new iPhones.""The point that I think I need to make when you think about   upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't   help us,"" Maestri began.He then went on to suggest that if the company weren't forced   to raise iPhone pricing in certain countries because of foreign   exchange movements, the company could potentially ""sell   significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle   standpoint.""Beyond the foreign exchange situation, Maestri also pointed   out that ""the more [Apple is] able to innovate with new   generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade   rate.""The rumors swirling about Apple's next-generation iPhone   models suggest that the improvements could be much more   significant generation-over-generation than what the company   delivered with the iPhone 7-series. Time will tell if they are   enough to catalyze the iPhone upgrade rate that Apple sees.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Netflix, Inc.

Additionally, stocks are being bolstered by a rising U.S. dollar, which is up nearly 1% after Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said late yesterday that a March interest rate hike was ""on the table.""makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehad advanced 0.23%, whileS&P 500futures were up 0.29% andNasdaq-100futures were higher by 0.21%.On the options front, volume plummeted on Monday following Friday's brisk session. On the day, only about 11.4 million calls and 11.8 million puts changed hands - coming in well below average. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio leapt to 0.75, though the 10-day moving average held at 0.69 for the fourth straight session.Turning to Monday's volume leaders,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) surged more than 11% after rumors hit the Street that the company was collaborating with chief rivalIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). Elsewhere,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) call traders continued to ramp up their positions heading into Thursday's quarterly earnings report, andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) short sellers appear to be hedging their positions.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD stock is on fire and call options traders were chomping at the bit to get in on the run on Monday.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterDriving AMD's latest rally was news that Intel was licensing AMD GPU technology.According to Kyle Bennet, editor in chief atHardOCP:""Intel is licensing AMD GPU technology. No money has changed hands yet, so there is no financial impact till late in the year, hence nothing in the current earnings report. The first product AMD is working on for Intel is a Kaby Lake processor variant … It is scheduled to come to market before the end of the year. I would expect more collaboration between AMD and Intel in the future on the graphics side.""If true, the Intel collaboration would be huge for AMD, potentially giving the company a leg up on its main GPU competitor,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD options traders apparently came to the same conclusion, as more than 670,000 contracts traded on the stock yesterday, with calls accounting for 64% of the day's take.Some of the more aggressive speculators have taken out considerable overhead call positions in the soon-to-expire 10 Feb series, where some 4,700 contacts are open at the $14 strike, with another 2,000-plus at $14.50.Twitter Inc (TWTR)Call speculation continues to ramp up on Twitter heading into Thursday's quarterly report. Analysts are expecting a profit of 12 cents per share from Twitter, butEarningsWhispers.complaces expectations about four cents higher at 16 cents per share. Given yesterday's activity in the options pits, speculative traders are banking on the latter figure.On Monday, TWTR stock saw more than 191,000 contracts change hands, with calls snapping up 62% of the day's take. The most popular 10 Feb strike is the $18 call, where more than 10,000 contracts currently reside. If TWTR's 1.3% premarket gain carries over into the open, these 10 Feb $18 calls will be firmly in the money.Additionally, the $18.50 and $19 strikes have also gained considerable attention, attracting OI of 8,600 and 5,500 contracts, respectively. If this bullish bid turns out to be more than just hype, TWTR could be eyeing $20 before all is said and done.Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)Netflix announced yesterday that I'll have to wait another eight months to watchseason two of ""Stranger Things.""While that's certainly a bit depressing, NFLX short sellers took that negativity to another level in January. The number ofNFLX shares sold short jumped by 5%to 25.2 million shares in the most recent reporting period - or roughly 6% of the stock's total float.Granted, short sellers are probably reacting more to NFLX's recent all-time highs and not the wait for ""Stranger Things.""Apple Inc.'s Ultra Accessory Connector: Don't Panic! (AAPL)Still, it would seem that many shorts are not taking any chances on NFLX going upside down, as call volume has picked up notably in the wake of the spike in short interest. On Monday, volume jumped to 172,000 contracts, with calls making up 58% of the day's take - arriving above average for NFLX.Further evidence that shorts are hedging their bets is the sharp rise in at-the-money NFLX call OI. For instance, more than 7,700 calls are open at the Feb $140 strike, with another 13,200 open at the March $140 strike. In fact, out-of-the-money OI is scarce at this point, with only the March $145 strike (12,700 contracts) holding any meaningful call accumulation.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Go Short Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Before Q4 Earnings;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) reports its fourth-quarter earnings after Thursday's close. Wall Street expects profits to more than double to 84 cents per share, and revenues to balloon by 50% to $2.11 billion. However, while the top and bottom lines continue to grow, the price of NVDA stock has risen exponentially faster.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn fact, it has become a case of too far, too fast for NVDA. So unless the graphics chip specialist has an absolutely blow-out quarter, I look for Nvidia stock to have difficulty moving appreciably higher.Nvidia was one of the best performing stocks of 2016, gaining almost 225%. Importantly, though, the price-to-earnings multiple expanded at a much faster rate, fueling much of the rally, and now stands at its highest level of the past five years.NVDA stock is shaping up as a battle between momentum and value.A look at the price-to-sales metric paints an even more euphoric picture of Nvidia's valuation. The 11.6 ratio is 5.8 times that of the S&P 500 - and the S&P 500 is trading at a historically rich ratio.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterNVDA stock is priced for perfection indeed.Peer group analysis reaffirms the extreme valuation multiples for NVDA. On every metric - earnings, book, sales, cash flow and yield - Nvidia stock is trading at a huge premium to its peers, the market and also its own five-year averages.Many analysts are voicing valuation concerns as well.Brian Algerof Roth Capital Partners just lowered his rating to ""Neutral"" from ""Buy"" and gives the stock a price target of just $120 - while that's a big upgrade from $95, it's only a couple percent higher from here. BMO Capital Markets and Susquehanna also have ""Neutral"" ratings on NVDA stock with price targets well below Monday's $117.31 closing price.NVDA Stock ChartsClick to EnlargeFrom a technical analysis perspective, NVDA stock is trading right at the all-time highs following an explosive 15% rally since bottoming on Jan. 18.With earnings looming Thursday, it will be interesting to see how the stock reacts at such a critical juncture.As I mentioned earlier, NVDA boils down to the classic momentum-versus-value argument. So far, the momentum camp has been the clear winner, with stock performance and valuations both reaching extremes.Inmy previous postonFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), I argued that it would take a huge beat to propel FB higher based on valuation. Facebook reported a big beat, yet the stock still fell.Similarly with Nvidia, I think you could see a case of an earnings beat and a tepid reaction in NVDA stock.Can General Motors Company (GM) Stock FINALLY Get Some Love?Implied volatility (IV) is ridiculously cheap in front of earnings, trading at only 21% IV, so option buying strategies are favored.How to Trade Nvidia Stock HereBuy NVDA 10 Feb $132 puts and sell NVDA 10 Feb $130 puts for a 70 cents net debit.Maximum loss of the trade is $70 per spread with a maximum gain of $130 per spread. Return on risk is 185%.Ideally, NVDA stock closes below $130 on expiration for the maximum gain.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

UAC is smaller than both USB-C and Apple's own Lightning port.Naturally, given AAPL's laser focus on making its devices thinner, that rapidly ramped up speculation the company could be preparing to move the iPhone and iPad to UAC from Lightning.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe Vergewas quick to chase down the UAC story. According to its sources, the Ultra Accessory Connectoris not part of a plan to introduce a new Apple port. Instead, it's the official name for an old connector that has been in use by various companies. For example,Nikon Corp (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NINOY) uses it as a connectivity option with digital cameras.The Vergesays that headphone manufacturers asked AAPL to add support for the Ultra Accessory Connector in its MFi program.Why the Panic Over UAC?AAPL has gained a reputation for ditching existing ports for new versions, especially when that new Apple port is smaller, letting it shrink its devices. AAPL fans have been particularly riled up over the last six months. First came the decision to eliminate the 3.5 mm headphone jack in the iPhone 7 in favor of Lightning or wireless headphones.Next, when Apple released the long-awaited new MacBook Pro, it replaced all legacy ports with the new USB-C. Those decisions have meant the expense and inconvenience of dongles and adapters to make old accessories work.And in 2012, AAPL created the mother of all headacheswhen it switched from the Dock Connectorit had used since the launch of the iPod, to the Lightning Port. That move let Apple make the iPhone thinner, but made a decade worth of speakers, chargers and other accessories incompatible with the new generation of devices. Manufacturers had to revamp their product lines to incorporate the new Apple port and consumers fumed.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?So you can understand the concern when news of the Ultra Accessory Connector leaked.UAC Is a Ripple Effect From the iPhone 7 Headphone JackAt this point, it looks as though the Ultra Accessory Connector is just the latest aftershock from that controversial decision to kill the headphone jack with the iPhone 7. While many iPhone buyers are shrugging and simplygoing wireless, there is still demand for wired headphones.And even wireless needs to plug intosomethingto recharge. A growing number of manufacturers are offering USB-C headphones, but that means the cable is incompatible with those Lightning-equipped iOS devices. AsThe Vergepoints out, having AAPL support the Ultra Accessory Connector lets those companies stick a  Lightning-to-UAC and USB-C-to-UAC dongle with their headphones to keepeveryonehappy … except the people who hate dongles.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Did Intel Corporation Just Reveal That It Will Be Inside of the Apple Inc. iPhone 8?;2/7/2017;"OnIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) most recent earnings call, CFO Robert Swan   provided some insight into the company's gross profit margin   guidance for the full year of 2017.Intel guided to full-year gross profit margin of 62% on a GAAP   basis for 2017 -- a 110 basis point (1.1%) improvement from the   60.9% gross profit margin that it reported for 2016.A pair of Apple iPhones. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, Intel tells investors to expect gross profit   margin of 62% in the first quarter of 2017, which suggests that   the company isn't expecting margins to improve throughout the   year. This is a little bit surprising, as Intel usually enjoys   the benefit of revenue leverage during the second half of any   given year relative to the first half, since industrywide   personal computer sales tend to be higher in the second half of   the year compared to the first.Swan explained what's going on, and from that explanation, the   chipmaker appears to be betting on having won cellular modem   orders for the next-generationApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone.The CFO speaksSwan said that ""headwinds"" to the company's gross profit   margin in 2017 compared to 2016 will come in the form of   increased non-volatile memory product sales, as well as from   modem sales. The executive was quick to explain that   increased memory and modem sales lead to ""good growth, increasing   profitability, [and] good earnings."" That said, he also conceded   that those products carry lower gross profit margins than the   rest of the company's business.The way to think about it is this: It's generally better for a   company to sell $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit marginand$30 worth of product at 30% gross profit margin -- diluting the   average gross profit margin percentage to 53% -- than to just   sell the $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit margin,   assuming all else is equal.What does this have to do with the iPhone 8?Circling back to the topic at hand, let's go over why this   commentary might suggest that Intel is inside the next   iPhone.If we look at the trend in Intel's cellular modem revenue, we   see that the company saw an initial ramp-up of shipments during   its third quarter, with sales accelerating in the fourth quarter.   This is consistent with Apple's iPhone ramp-up plans: it builds a   bunch of phones in anticipation of the launch, sells even more   phones in the quarter following the launch, and then it sees   iPhone sales cool off in the following quarters -- until the   cycle begins anew.If Intel doesn't expect to be in the next-generation iPhone,   then investors should expect the company to see a substantial   drop in cellular modem revenue during the second half of 2017.   (In this case, Intel would only be shipping modems into older,   discounted iPhone 7 models.)In that case, cellular modemswouldn'tbe a headwind to gross profit margin improvement for Intel during   the second half of 2017 relative to the first half of 2017, since   its cellular modem volumes/revenue would naturally decline --   proving atailwindto average gross profit margin, not aheadwind.It seems likely, then, that Intel expects to be inside of at   least some of Apple's next-generation iPhone models.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Unlikely S&P 500 Rally Is Still Well Intact (Deserved or Not);2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEDITOR'S NOTE: Sam Collins will return on Feb. 21.makeArticleAd();The bulls may have been firmly in charge of the market on Friday, inspired by a strong employment report for January. As has been the case so many times since December though, the rally lacked follow-through. TheS&P 500'sclose of 2,292.56 yesterday was 4.86 points down from, or 0.21% below, Friday's last trade.And that was more or less the story for theNasdaq Compositeand theDow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq fell 3.21 points to end the session at 5,663.55, while the Dow slumped 19.04 points, or 0.09%., to close at 20,052.42. None of the major indices made their way into new-high territory, though all of them remain within striking distance of record-high levels.Energy stocks were the day's big loser, giving up 0.9% even though crude oil eked out a gain of 0.36% on Monday, to close at $53.20 per barrel; investors were more concerned about the dollar's strength and what it may mean for oil stocks.Schlumberger Limited(NYSE:SLB) did the most damage, with a 1% stumble.At the other end of the spectrum, technology stocks finished the session with a tiny gain of 0.1%.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) carried the weight there, with a 1% gain of its own.The weakness was broad too. For the NYSE, 59% of its listings lost ground, and 37% advanced The Nasdaq's breadth was similarly bearish, with 60% of its issues losing ground versus 35% of them rising on Monday. Even so, depth - selling volume - was modest. The NYSE's total trade was only 3.11 billion shares, down a bit from Friday's action. The NYSE's and the Nasdaq's bullish/bearish volume ratios essentially mirrored both indices' advancer/decliner ratios.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Still, a handful of names overcame marketwide weakness.Hasbro, Inc.(NASDAQ:HAS) was one them. Shares of the toymaker jumped 14% following the company'sfourth quarter earnings reportthat topped expectations.The overall market remains in its tepidly bullish mode, framed as much by horizontal boundaries as it is by rising lows and rising highs. For the S&P 500, that horizontal floor is at 2253. More recently though, the index has found support at a modestly meaningful rising support level, and it remains above the 20-day moving average line.To start the next leg of bullishness though, the S&P 500 will need to clear the 2,301 ceiling where it peaked two weeks ago.Click to EnlargeThe Nasdaq Composite is also knocking on the door of a breakout. Monday's high of 5,668 is right below the high from two weeks ago.Click to EnlargeWhile momentum is bullish, there's no denying stocks are technically overextended and struggling to tack on more gains with any amount of consistency. The S&P 500 is now 6% above the 200-day moving average line after having rallied 10% since the early November low. That's a tough act to follow, particularly this time of year.February is generally a tough month, and even tougher when it's the first February of a four-year Presidential term. The S&P 500 essentially breaks even this month (and then only because it finishes strong following a mid-month lull), and when it's the year after an election, February averages a 1.6% loss.Still, until the indices actually start to break under key technical levels, the undertow has to be considered bullish even if valuations are reaching uncomfortable levels again. The S&P 500 is now valued at a trailing P/E of 21.2. That doesn't leave much room for gains, which is why they've been so slow-going of late.Today's Trading LandscapeTo see a list of the companies reporting earnings today,click here.For a list of this week's economic reports due out,click here.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Tell us what you think about this article!

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Still Finding Growth;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NYSE:MSFT) used to be a one-trick, maybe two-trick pony less than 10 years ago. My how things have changed.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Under founder Bill Gates, DOS and then Windows operating systems were on virtually every computer that wasn't anApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) machine. And that dominance continued unabated until the dotcom bubble burst.It wasn't the ensuing crash that hurt, it was the fact that tech had reached a point of inflection.From then on, it wasn't just about owning a fiber-optic switching company with a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. One of the sayings from those heady times was, if it doesn't have a triple digit P/E, it's not worth buying.The crash meant the internet and tech itself was growing up. There was plenty of consolidation that happened after the dotcom crash. Some worked out, some didn't. But it was necessary for companies that were going to survive to find a way to pivot into the new marketplace.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99It was also around that time that Microsoft was embroiled in a major antitrust case with the U.S. Government. This meant that MSFT had to change on many levels, just to survive. It was crucial to find a way out of this, because most of the government computers were running Windows, and if Microsoft couldn't find a bright path through the case, it may well lose a very lucrative long-term contract.By 2006, Gates was out of day-to-day operations and his No. 2, Steve Ballmer, took over. While he started strong, it wasn't long until it was apparent that doing the same thing a little differently was not going to cut it as technology was expanding rapidly and interconnections were popping among different tech fields.In 2014, the current CEO, Satya Nadella, took the helm and began to completely reorganize the company, shedding unprofitable and unwieldy divisions and focusing on the future of the company. That meant cleaning up the mess created by the acquisition of the mobile phone business ofNokiaand building a robust cloud-based business for both operating systems and for client storage.It certainly helped that he was previously head of MSFT R&D. But some were still skeptical of his approach, especially in the early days, when the new divisions weren't getting much traction and the established businesses were left wanting - remember Windows 8?Now three years into his role, Nadella has gone from potential goat to real hero. And the most recent earnings number prove out his strategy. He has remained focused and disciplined, and it has paid off.Microsoft has committed $1 billion into cybersecurity investment for its services as well as R&D. The company is reporting 600,000 to 700,000 attacks a week, up from about 20,000 just three years ago. But it's not as much the threat as the opportunity. According to tech sitetechemergence.com, there's an artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity market that will be worth $8.3 trillion market by 2035 in the U.S. alone.And given the fact that the U.S. government is one of MSFT stock's biggest clients, security is crucial.Why GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Deserves More PatienceGoing hand in hand with this is the impressive growth of Azure, Microsoft's cloud-based operating and storage system. Revenue growth year over year is running around 93% and Azure is getting big enough to compete with Amazon Web Services, the cloud division ofAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN).Recent earnings were solid overall and there's no reason to think MSFT stock has seen its best days already. And while its 30 P/E may look expensive, AMZN is trading at a P/E of 185.

How Apple, Inc.'s Share Repurchases Are Driving Record Results;2/6/2017;"Many investors don't fully appreciate just how powerfulApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) share repurchase program is, or how tangible its   benefits are. This is one of (if notthe) most accretive capital return programs out there, simply by   virtue of its size.Most of the time, companies opt to merely offset the dilution   associated with stock-based compensation to employees. But Apple   buys back its stock hand over fist, and the result is a   significant reduction in shares outstanding. Look no further than   Apple's share count since its capital return program started back   in late 2012.makeArticleAd();AAPL Shares Outstandingdata byYCharts.To date, Apple has now cumulatively repurchased an incredible   $143.7 billion in less than five years. That's larger than the   market caps of many mature megacap companies (those worth over   $100 billion). As of right now, Apple's board has authorized $175   billion in share repurchases, and the company provides annual   updates to its capital return program every April.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.The company has tended to allocate more of its capital return   program toward repurchases, confident that shares are   undervalued. I'd expect the board to do likewise for 2017.Image source: Apple.Record EPS, brought to you by share buybacksApple noted that it set several records last quarter,   including revenue records for many of its most important   businesses. Earnings per share also hit a new all-time quarterly   record of $3.36, despite the fact that net income was down   modestly in dollar terms at $17.9 billion.MetricQ4 2015Q4 2016Net income$18.4 billion$17.9 billionDiluted EPS$3.28$3.36Shares used in diluted EPS5.59 billion5.33 billionData source: SEC filings. Calendar quarters shown.In no uncertain terms, the aggressive share repurchase   activity led to a meaningful reduction in shares outstanding,   which is what allowed Apple to post its highest quarterly EPS   ever. That's what I call earnings accretion. For shareholders, a   record bottom line is as tangible as it gets.Ideally, Apple continues its capital return program with the     same emphasis on share repurchases. But in order to continue at     the same rate, Apple may need to repatriate some cash since it     is now approaching $100 billion in total debt, including     commercial paper and its recent $10 billion bond offering.     Since the capital returns have largely been funded with debt,     and there is a limit to how much debt Apple can take on,     Apple's domestic cash could be the most significant limiting     factor to continued repurchases.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple, Inc. Is Now Approaching $100 Billion in Debt;2/6/2017;"Just days afterApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings release last week, the company raised a   cool $10 billion in debt. Like prior bond sales, this one   consisted of numerous tranches with maturities of up to 30 years,   and included both fixed-rate notes as well as some floaters.   There wasn't really much that was notable about the bond offering   itself; it's comparable to the paper that Apple sells every   year.PrincipalFixed or FloatingmakeArticleAd();RateMaturity$500 millionFloating3-month LIBOR plus 8 basis points2019$500 millionFloating3-month LIBOR plus 20 basis points2020$1 billionFloating3-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points2022$500 millionFixed1.55%2019$1 billionFixed1.9%2020$1.5 billionFixed2.5%2022$1.75 billionFixed3%2024$2.25 billionFixed3.35%2027$1 billionFixed4.25%2047Data source: Prospectus.However, it was done a bit earlier the usual this time around,   and Apple is now approaching $100 billion in debt.It's the time of the seasonTypically, Apple conducts these bond offerings shortly after   providing updates to its capital return program, which is usually   alongside its April earnings release. They usually occur in April   or May. But Apple needed to sell the bonds slightly earlier this   year for a few interrelated reasons.Apple Store in Sydney. Image source: Apple.Apple entered into its ninth accelerated share repurchase   program last quarter, and total share repurchases were $11   billion. That took a big bite out of Apple's domestic cash   position, and the company exited the quarter with $15.9 billion   in domestic cash. That's the low end of Apple's comfort zone;   Apple usually keeps its domestic cash in the range of $15 billion   to $25 billion for operational and strategic needs.Note how Apple's domestic cash has dwindled in recent years   due to aggressive capital return activity. (This chart does not   reflect the recent bond offering.)Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.The company simply blew through its domestic dollars a little   faster than usual this year with share repurchases.$100 billion and countingSince debt largely funds Apple's massive capital returns, the   debt load that it has taken on over the past five years is   commensurately large. At the end of 2016, Apple had $87.5 billion   in long-term debt (including the current portion) and commercial   paper, which is just short-term unsecured debt. The recent $10   billion bond offering will now bring that figure up to around   $97.5 billion.The offering was still able to fetch investment-grade credit   ratings, but it goes without saying that the more debt that Apple   takes on over time, the worse its credit rating profile becomes.   Meanwhile, there's been a lot of talk about a potential tax   repatriation holiday from the Trump administration. If Apple is   able to bring home a meaningful chunk of the $230.2 billion that   now sits overseas, it could theoretically extinguish some of that   debt and strengthen the balance sheet. That could effectively   give Apple a few more years to continue its debt-funded capital   return strategy.Until then, Apple will just have to keep selling paper.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Who Are Uber's Biggest Competitors?;2/6/2017;"Uber, the massive, omnipresent ride-sharing company, has dominated the industry since its inception in 2009. It has spread to more than 60 countries since then, and was recently valued at $68 billion, making investors wonder when, and if, Uber willfile for an IPO.The emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.If you're looking to leave controversy-plagued Uber behind-and recently, a lot of people did,rallying behind the #deleteUber hashtagafter a certain executive order from President Trump-but you still want the luxury of on-demand rides, there are increasingly popular alternatives for you.Here's a rundown of the biggest competitors Uber faces:LyftLaunched in 2012, Lyft is a transportation company known for its fuzzy pink mustaches on the front or on dashboards of cars-silly, yet quite helpful when trying to spot your ride.The San Francisco-based company works similarly to Uber. Within its smartphone app, users see a map with a pin at their location, animated cars moving around nearby, an estimate of how far away the nearest ride is, and a big button labeled ""Request Lyft.""Also like Uber, Lyft offers multiple levels of service: Lyft Line (a shared ride option that can save users up to 60% on fare); Plain Lyft (a ride for solo travelers or groups up to four); and Lyft Plus (larger cars and SUVs perfect for those traveling with suitcases and boxes, or if you want to ride with a large group). You can select which type of ride you want with a slider tool at the top of the app.As for rates, they vary by city, type of ride, and current demand; you can also choose to add a tip if desired. It is important to note that like Uber, Lyft does use surge pricing.In the United States, Lyft is available in roughly 220 cities and areas nationwide, as well as nine cities within Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, The Philippines, and Vietnam.CurbFormerly Taxi Magic (2009) and RideCharge (2007), Curb was born in 2014, and is a company that connects people with safe, reliable rides from professional, insured, and fully licensed taxi and other for-hire drivers. Based in Alexandria, Virginia, Curb operates in more than 60 U.S. cities nationwide, partnering with 90 cab companies and driving 35,000 cars.Curb is app-based, opening up to a map that marks your location; it also shows available Curb drivers nearby. Users can either book rides instantly, or schedule them up to 24 hours in advance (a service convenient for travelers). There is a choice of paying fares within the app or with cash in the car, as well as vehicle options to best suit your needs.On its website, Curb boasts that rides are always available and ready to pick you up, as well as messaging that ""all rides begin and end at the curb,"" a motto reflected in its logo.Didi ChuxingConceived from a merger back in 2015, Didi Chuxing is a ride-hailing service company made up of China's two largest taxi-hailing firms: Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache. Didi Chuxing, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi, is often referred to as the ""Uber of China,"" and virtually owns all of China's taxi-hailing market, with a 99% market share, and 87% market share when it comes it hailing private vehicles.It operates in over 400 cities across the region, versus UberChina's humble 45 cities.In January, the company said it booked 1.43 billion rides in 2015 alone, and completed 200 million rides last December. Didi is also in a strategic partnership with the above mentioned Lyft, which allowed the company to operate in China for the first time.Didi Chuxing is well-funded and backed by tech giants Apple Inc.AAPL, Tencent HoldingsTCEHY, and AlibabaBABA. According to itsCrunchBasepage, the company's total equity funding is valued at $7.32 billion in six funding rounds from 17 investors.Earlier this year, Uber conceded defeat,selling its UberChina operationsto Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies. Uber faced obstacle after obstacle trying to enter China's fast-growing ride-hailing market, losing a total of $2 billion there.GrabFounded in 2011, Grab (formerly known as GrabTaxi) is a ride service company that operates in Southeast Asia, primarily in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Like Uber, Grab works through an app-based platform for smartphones, and users can download the app on the Google Play store, Apple's App Store, and Blackberry World.Grab has raised a total of $680 million in total equity funding, with roughly 75,000 registered taxi drivers in its network.Their mission is simple. Grab ""aims to revamp these local taxi markets by introducing simple, cost effective mobile-based technology to both the supply (dispatch companies) and demand (passenger) sides of the distribution chain…[their] vision is to revamp the South East Asian taxi industry, making it a safer and more efficient means of transport we can all be proud of.""Announced last December, Grab joined in an alliance with Lyft, Didi, and Ola, India's main ride-hailing company, in order to rival Uber as well as grow beyond its Southeast Asia market.OlaStarted as an online cab aggregator in Mumbai back in 2010, Ola is an app-based transportation company and is one of the fastest growing businesses in India. It has raised $1.23 billion in equity funding through eight rounds from 20 investors.Ola currently has over 40,000 cars in its network across 22 cities.Reserved through its mobile app, the company provides different types of cab services ranging from economic to luxury travel. Ola supports both cash and digital payment options with Ola money. It also recently rolled out two news services: outstation and rental. Outstation allows customers to book a cab two hours in advance for intercity travel, while rental lets customers rent a car on an hourly basis.Like Lyft and Grab, Ola is partnered with Didi Chuxing in what is turning out to be quite the international effort against Uber. Together, the four companies rolled out joint products last year, beginning with Didi riders who, when visiting the U.S., can open their Didi app to hail a Lyft.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Here’s How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) still appear undervalued despite the company already significantly outperforming the market. If you bought stock in Alibaba since the end of December, you're up almost 20%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, for reasons I will outline, Alibaba stock - thanks to emergence in the cloud and the momentum in its core e-commerce business - can still deliver 25% returns in the next 12 to 18 months.Assessing the Value in Alibaba StockAlibaba shares have risen some 15% year to date, compared with about 2% rise in theS&P 500 Index. Based on fiscal 2018 earnings estimates of $4.30 per share, Alibaba stock is currently priced at a forward price-earnings ratio of roughly 23, which is about in line with the average stock in the S&P 500.And here's the thing: Assuming the company does earn $4.30 per share, that would translate to year-over-year earnings growth of 23%. From my vantage point, Alibaba stock remains one of the better bargains on the market even with its recent rally.In other words, investors still have an opportunity to buy not only into a great growth story, but also diversify their investments by betting on the growth of China's middle class. But Alibaba is more than just a bet on China's recovering economy. The company, which saw a 54% jump inthird-quarter revenue, leading to an impressive 17-cent beat on the bottom line, crushed Wall Street's fiscal estimates on almost every metric.3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush InvestorsOften compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) because of their e-commerce similarities, Alibaba founder/executive chairman Jack Ma and CEO Daniel Zhang prove they can do what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has shown a knack for: Mash the profit-margin accelerator whenever he feels like it and when the market least expects it. And as with Amazon, Alibaba's cloud platform Alicloud (which posted a 115% year-over-year jump in revenue) has become a force.Not only is Alibaba enjoying an increase in the number of paying customers, the customers are also spending higher than usual. All told, the company's strong revenue growth, driven by its diversified technological and data strategy continues to pay off. And with the company boosting its 2017 fiscal year revenue growth guidance from 48% to 53%, Alibaba is showing no signs of slowing down.Bottom Line for Alibaba StockWith cloud revenues beginning to take a bigger portion of the business, combined with the strength in its core e-commerce operation, BABA has tons of room to run.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200As such, while I'm not willing to suggest BABA deserves the same respect as Amazon, which is priced at a forward P/E of 63, Alibaba should command a P/E of 30, which puts Alibaba stock at around $130, delivering almost 25% to 30% in the next year-and-a-half or so.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe postHere's How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%appeared first onInvestorPlace."
3 Stocks That Turned $5,000 into $10,000 or More in Just 3 Years;2/6/2017;"Smart investors know the stock market is a long term game, and   trying to seek out companies that can double your money in just a   few years time is a fool's errand. Anything can happen in the   short run to upset the best laid plans, but over the longer term,   the cream will rise to the top and the best companies will   shine.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Still, sometimes top stocks also perform remarkably well for   investors in the near term. Here are three examples of companies   that have doubled investors money -- not over five, 10, or 20   years, but in just three years time! $5,000 invested in these   stocks in 2014 would be worth $10,000 or more today. That's a   result few investments are able to replicate.Moreover, these aren't super-riskypenny stocks, but rather members of theS&P 500index, meaning they're among the biggest companies on the market   today.1. Ulta SalonBeauty care and products are fashion statements, and no   cosmetics company has made a bigger or bolder statement in recent   years thanUlta Salon(NASDAQ: ULTA) , which sells more than 20,000 products from 500   vendors at almost 1,000 stores. It has become the industry leader   not just because it sells more stuff than the competition, but   because it combines a broad selection of products in a unique   salon environment that can't be easily replicated, especially by   online retailers.While e-commerce has drained market share from any number of   bricks-and-mortar retailers, causing them to close stores and   shrink their square footage, Ulta brashly proclaims it will   maintain its breakneck expansion pace. By the time it reports its   fourth-quarter earnings, it will have opened 100 net new stores   in 2016 and grown its square footage by 11% over the prior   year.Image source: Ulta Salon.Cosmetics is certainly a crowded space, and consumers can   purchase cheaper products from their local drugstores. The allure   of the space has even tempted fast-fashion leaderH&Mto enter the market with its own discounted line. But when   it comes to personal beauty care, consumers are increasingly   unwilling to skimp on quality, and Ulta Salon's business   model of selling them in a salon setting where professional   beauty care specialists can provide instant advice and feedback   is one reason it has generated returns totaling nearly 217% over   the past three years.2. BroadcomTheBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) of today isn't the fabless semiconductor company   of years past. In 2016, it was acquired by Singapore-based Avago   Technologies for $37 billion, which renamed itself Broadcom   Limited, but to spice things up kept the AVGO ticker symbol. Once   the merger was complete, it sold its entire Internet of Things   portfolio of products toCypress Semiconductorfor $550 million. Today, the resulting company describes itself   as ""a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad   range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions   that serve the wired infrastructure, wireless communications,   enterprise storage and industrial markets."" A full plate, to be   sure.Image source: Getty Images.Yet theReader's Digestversion of that is Broadcom is primarily a supplier of chips to   smartphone and tablet producers,especiallyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which accounts for more than 10% of its sales,   but also likelySamsung, which helps explain why its stock has done so well over the   past few years.Since 2014, Broadcom's stock has returned more than 276%,   meaning a $5,000 investment then would now be valued at almost   $14,000, a near three-bagger.Its success in the mobile market -- the company is generating   revenues of $13 billion annually -- meant that it could afford to   sell off a small business like its IoT portfolio (which made less   than $200 million) without thinking twice, even as its rivals are   racing headlong into the space. Being a key supplier to the   mobile market should allow it to continue generating big   returns.3. NVIDIAUlta and Broadcom may have done well for investors over the   past few years, but their gains pale in comparison to the returnsNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) has generated. Rising about 600% in value since   2014, the graphics chipmaker would have turned a $5,000   investment into about $35,000.Image source: Getty Images.NVIDIA was able to post such remarkable results because it has   its finger on the pulse ofall the technologiesthat are driving into the future in sixth gear. From   artificial intelligence and self-driving cars to augmented and   virtual reality -- not to mention its bread-and-butter gaming   markets, which almost all the other advances are tying into --   NVIDIA is making the chips that power the newest devices.We'll be seeing soon how its fourth quarter played out, but if   it continues to follow the pattern from its third quarter, it   will be one to look forward to. Last quarter, NVIDIA revenues   surged 54% year over year to $2 billion, and the company   predicted it would grow another 50% in Q4. Analysts who were   caught flat-footed by how will the third quarter played out have   upped their forecasts for an equally robust consensus view of the   fourth.While its three-year results have been impressive, most of the   gains came in the last year, and a stock that rises so far so   fast can be ripe for a correction. Not that it won't continue   higher, but if it takes a pause before it soars once again,   investors probably shouldn't be surprised. And grow it should,   since industry analysts see the A.I., V.R., and driverless car   markets becoming huge in the near future.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Twilio Inc (TWLO) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo sayTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) has taken investors on something of a roller coaster ride over the course the past eight months would be a considerable understatement. Twilio stock rallied from its June IPO price of $15 to a high near $71 by September, only to peel back to a low of less than $26 in January.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrSince hitting that low, TWLO stock has gained more than 20% … right in front of the Twilio earnings report due after Tuesday's close.The conundrum: Twilio has yet to trade based on any semblance of ""value."" It has been and continues to be driven by a perception of potential, and that perception is altered on a pretty regular basis. Hence the big swings in just a few short months.The good news is, Tuesday's Q4 earnings report will likely answer some of the question that investors have been asking about the company's future.The bad news is, owners of Twilio stock may not like those answers.Twilio Q4 Earnings PreviewTwilio, for those not familiar with it, has turned cloud computing technologies into a robust telephony and messaging tool. Anything an individual business could want to do with, or through, a smartphone or app, TWLO can make it happen securely, en masse, via the cloud.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99It's a relatively young company, too. Twilio has only been in business since 2013, and a publicly traded company since the middle of last year.Revenue growth hasn't been a problem at any point, though. For the quarter ending in September, the top line of $71.5 million was up 61% on a year-over-year basis, and estimates for a top line of $74.2 million are 44% better than Q4 2015's sales.What has been a sore spot, though, is earnings - or a lack thereof. Twilio isn't profitable, and isn't expected to be anytime soon. Analysts anticipate a loss of 5 cents per share on Tuesday, though that would be a slight improvement on the 10-cent loss booked in the same quarter a year earlier.3 Things TWLO Stock Holders Need to Chew OnClearly Twilio stock is still a story stock, rocked more by rhetoric and assumption than by actual results. Results - relative results - will set the tone for the rhetoric, though, and that rhetoric will largely be shaped by three overarching ideas.In no particular order …An 'Even If' Valuation:The market is mostly OK with the lack of earnings thus far, and the unlikelihood of a swing to a profit in the foreseeable future. As was noted, the story aspect of this company has been more than compelling enough to keep trades interested.They're becoming increasingly suspicious, however, that even if Twilio were to turn a typical 10% profit on its revenue, the valuation still makes no sense. At its current annual revenue run rate of $290 million, $29 million worth of income still doesn't make sense of the company's current market cap of $2.8 billion.Its Relationship With Facebook:The Twilio platform integrates (quite nicely) with Messenger and WhatsApp, fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which accounts for roughly a fourth of the company's revenue now thatMessenger was added to the mix last year. But that's not guaranteed revenue going forward.As Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicleobserved following the Q2 Twilio earnings report:""Variable revenue ($8.1 million) was down 14% sequentially and dropped to 12.6% of revenue from 16%. While some investors may worry about the decline, we believe that it largely reflects the lumpiness of revenue from WhatsApp, Twilio's largest customer and the main component of variable revenue.""Slowing Growth/Outlook:As was noted, traders had been willing to pay a premium for TWLO stock because its red-hot growth rate presumably would catch up with the stock's valuation, and even spur a profit. The anticipated top line for its fourth quarter is barely better than its Q3 revenue, and even analysts that expect a top-line beat aren't looking for a big one - only about $3 million.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200To that end, Twilio needs to serve up some plausible Q1 and full-year (2017) revenue guidance that's better than the current figures of $77.85 million and $352.6 million, respectively.Bottom Line for Twilio StockThough TWLO shares may finally look like they're on the mend after paying the usual post-IPO price - a major setback - between September and December, it's still a bit too soon to make such an assumption. The rally since early January may still be nothing more than a relief rally in the wake of amajor inflow of new TWLO stock that had been tied up until December 22nd.The pressure remains on the company to prove its worth. Tuesday's report will either do so, or it won't, and it looks to be a 50/50 proposition at this time.Look for fireworks either way.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Will Finally StabilizeAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Sell Itself, But Probably Won’t;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLess than two years after clearing $50,Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) stock trades around $6. A series of disastrous earnings reports has sent Fitbit stock tumbling. The most recent was the disclosure of preliminary Q4 results last week, which imply a nearly 20% decline in sales year-over-year in the key holiday quarter.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitCompetition fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), andGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN), among others, appears to be a key problem for the company, particularly in the U.S. The resulting decline in growth has had a substantially negative effect on FIT stock.That's not going to get better.Lately, Fitbit has been compared toGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), another company that drove explosive growth mostly off a single product only to see sales nosedive. The question is whether in this day and age, a single-product company can support the expense necessary to compete with behemoths like Apple and Samsung. The answer, at least from Fitbit and GPRO, appears to be no.And that would seem to argue for a sale of FIT to one of those larger players. The problem for Fitbit stock investors, however, is that such a move seems unlikely - at least before it's too late.Why FIT Should Sell ItselfIn response to the lower demand in Q4, FIT is cutting costs. It's laying off 6% of its staff, part of an overall effort to cut $200 million a year in operating expense. That's a substantial amount of savings, given that Fitbit stock has a market cap under $1.4 billion at the moment.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketBut what's less important than what is being saved is what's left: some $850 million in fiscal 2017, according to the company. It's a huge amount of money for what, at its core, still is a single-product company. Yes, FIT is adding software to create a ""platform"", and its product line goes beyond its most popular wearable. But compared to the diversification of an Apple or a Samsung, there's no comparison.Fitbit has to build an expense base to support one product; its competitors (even Garmin) support multiple products. That matters not only in terms of cost, but in terms of sales. It's easier for Apple to cajoleBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY) to push the Apple Watch when Best Buy is also selling millions of dollars' worth of MacBooks and iPhones. FIT doesn't have that leverage, and expecting it to compete with electronics giants seems simply foolhardy.As for the cost structure, even with the $200 million in reduced spend, FIT is guiding for a loss next year. (That loss excludes the cost of stock grants issued to Fitbit executives, no less.) With one product, there's no ability to spread out expense for everything from salespeople to R&D to IT. FIT is likely going to spend $240 million in 2016 just on sales and marketing - for one product!That expense rose 23% through the first three quarters - the cost of trying to be David against multiple Goliaths. But the story seems likely to end much more poorly for Fitbit stock.Why Fitbit Stock Won't Sell ItselfFrom that standpoint, a sale of FIT stock to a larger player would seem to make sense. Apple, Samsung or Garmin all would make sense. The Fitbit brand remains strong, and an acquirer almost certainly could cut hundreds of millions of dollars itself. A slimmer (pardon the pun) FIT would thus add a nice amount of profit, even assuming a premium paid to acquire Fitbit stock.There are a couple of problems with this scenario. The first is that Fitbit stock has a dual-class system. FIT is thus controlled basically by its two founders and venture capital firm True Ventures. One of those founders, CEO James Park,saidin the release accompanying the preliminary fourth-quarter figures that the company simply was in ""a temporary slowdown and transition period"".As long as Park, along with True Ventures and co-founder Eric Friedman, believe the weakness is only temporary, Fitbit won't sell itself. And if Park is wrong, and Fitbit is surpassed by larger players, by then, it will likely be too late.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformAnother issue, counterintuitively, is FIT's huge cash balance. The company expects to have $700 million in cash at the end of Q4 - over half of its market capitalization. But that cash also limits the premium an acquirer will pay for Fitbit stock. The enterprise value at the moment - what the market says the business is worth - is about $670 million. Assuming Fitbit could get twice that price from an acquirer, it would have to sell itself for only about $9.30 per share.So hopes of a FIT acquisition rest, essentially, on the co-founders of the company agreeing to sell the business for more than 80% less than it was worth less than two years ago. That's a highly unlikely outcome. Park and Friedman are going to believe Fitbit can turn around - it'stheircompany. They turned their idea into a business worth over $10 billion not that long ago; it's silly to think they would then sell it for a bit over $1 billion at this point.And maybe FIT can turn itself around, which would certainly drive upside in Fitbit stock. But it seems a very difficult path. While it's hard to think of a billion-dollar company as a ""little guy,"" Fitbit is a little guy when compared to its competition. And in this day and age, it's awful tough for the little guy to go at it alone.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You BackThe postWhy Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Sell Itself, But Probably Won'tappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Will Finally Stabilize;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen the President of the United Stateslightens his focus on high drug pricesand instead looks at the whole Medicare system and its pricing structure for patient care as a whole … well, generic drug stocks should be soaring. But that's not the case. While theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) rose on the news, beaten-down shares ofValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) plumbed yearly lows.makeArticleAd();Source:Wikimedia (Modified)When Valeant reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 28, will VRX stock finally rebound?A month is a long time for Valeant shareholders. The market will judge, in advance, sales growth from the Salix unit. Xifaxan sales rose from $220 million to $273 million year-over-year in the third quarter. That is above an annualized $1 billion in sales, but VRX will need sales growing at an even faster rate. Salix bolstered its sales team. The company said it would loosen its budget to allow for higher advertising spending.Asset Sales IgnoredBuying of VRX stock picked up when rumors circulated it would sell Salix or B+L. When the CEO sold non-core assets, including its skin division, at a price of 7 times sales, the stock rallied, but then slumped.Investors want to see a multibillion-dollar sale now. Unfortunately, a sale of that size not only takes time but needs a healthy premium attached. By cutting operating expenses, raising research and development spend, and advertising more, Salix and B+L will reverse their sales slump.5 Trump-Proof Pharma Dividend Stocks to BuyIn November, 2016, Valeantsaid:""Our divestitures program is expected to allow us to reduce our quantum of debt further. We continue to expect that between our free cash flow and divestiture proceeds, we'll be able to reduce debt by more than $5 billion by early 2018.""Selling assets takes time. Valeant has plenty of time and sufficient cash flow to search for the right buyer by 2018.ValuationValeant trades at a steep discount to that of other generic drug makers. One metric illustrating this is the price-to-sales, which is 0.47 for VRX sales:Teva Pharmaceuticals(NYSE:TEVA) has a P/S of 1.7.Endo International(NASDAQ:ENDP), whose business is moving from generic drugs to promising drug discovery, has a P/S of 0.72.Mylan N.V.(NASDAQ:MYL), whose EpiPen pricing caught the attention of government trades at a P/S of 2.Trading StrategyClick to EnlargeValeant is a speculative stock.

Is Fitbit Inc. a Bear Trap or Bull Trap?;2/6/2017;"Shares ofFitbit(NYSE: FIT) recently fell to an all-time low after the fitness   tracker maker released dismal fourth quarter preliminary earnings   and bleak guidance for fiscal 2017. The company now expects its   fourth quarter revenue to fall 18%-20% annually, missing its   prior guidance for 4% growth and representing its first   year-over-year decline since its IPO.Image source: Fitbit.makeArticleAd();On the bottom line, it expects a non-GAAP net loss of   $0.51-$0.56 per share, compared to its prior guidance for a   profit of $0.14-$0.18 per share. That's a big drop from its   profit of $0.35 in the year-ago quarter, and represents its first   unprofitable quarter. Fitbit says it sold 6.5 million devices   during the quarter, which represents a 21% decline from a year   earlier. Non-GAAP gross margin is also expected to be ""materially   below"" its prior forecast of 46%, which already represented an   all-time low.And that pain won't end anytime soon. Fitbit expects to   generate just $1.5-$1.7 billion in revenues in fiscal 2017, which   would represent a 26% decline (at the midpoint) and miss the   consensus estimate of $2.4 billion. It will also remain in the   red with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.22-$0.44 for the year, well   below expectations for a profit of $0.64. Lastly, it announced   that it would lay off 110 employees, or 6% of its workforce, to   reduce its operating expenses.With numbers this bad, it's easy to hate this stock. But some   contrarian investors might also argue that the stock has fallen   too fast and too far. Let's take a closer look at the bullish and   bearish cases for Fitbit, and see why it could burn both   sides.Why Fitbit could be a bear trapFitbit has been averypopular target for short sellers over the past year. As of this   writing, 43% of its shares are being shorted. But when short   interest is that high,anypositive news about Fitbit -- a new product, aggressive cost   cutting measures, or acquisition buzz -- could trigger a short   squeeze.With an enterprise value of $680 million and an EV-to-sales   ratio of just 0.3, Fitbit is very cheap. That makes it a   lucrative buyout target forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Garmin(NASDAQ: GRMN) , or other companies looking to expand into the   wearables market. By buying Fitbit, Apple could expand its   wearables reach beyond the Apple Watch,which failedto turn smartwatches into mainstream gadgets. Garmin could buy   Fitbit to broaden its fitness tracker portfolio and further   diversify its business away from its weaker automotive GPS   unit.Image source: Fitbit.Fitbit has also been diversifying its business with mobile   payments and  its acquisitions of Pebble's assets and   Vector's smartwatches -- indicating that it could soon create   feature-rich smartwatches tethered to an app ecosystem. That   ecosystem could bolster Fitbit's user loyalty figures while   diversifying its top line. It could also sign more corporate   wellness partnerships to secure more bulk enterprise orders.   Fitbit expects its financial performance to ""stabilize"" in the   second half of 2017 as it reduces its operating expenses   (especially sales and marketing) by $200 million -- so the stock   could bottom out soon.Why Fitbit could be a bull trapHowever, the numbers all suggest that Fitbit is still   struggling to carve out a niche between low-end rivals likeXiaomi, sports performance challengers like Garmin, and high-end   smartwatch makers like Apple. Fitbit is still the largest   wearables maker in the world with 23% market share, according to   research firm  IDC. But its market share rose just 1.6   percentage points between the third quarters of 2015 and   2016.That topped Xiaomi, Garmin, and Apple's year-over-year growth,   but it didn't outpace the growth of the ""others"" category --   which grew from 37% to 45%. This indicates that the market is   becoming saturated with smaller players, which could drive down   price expectations.Meanwhile, downsizing in the face of fierce competition is   rarely a winning strategy. By reducing its sales and marketing   spend, Fitbit could be marginalized by other wearables makers   throughout the year. A 6% workforce reduction also might not be   enough to strengthen its bottom line growth. Looking ahead,   Fitbit will likely acquire additional companies in a desperate   bid for growth, but inadvertently ""diworsify"" its business   instead.My verdict: It's a bull trapFitbit looks undervalued, but its disastrous fourth quarter   numbers indicate that its core business model is crumbling, and   that mainstream demand for wearables hasn't been as robust as   analysts had predicted. I believe that investors should stay far   away from this fading stock, but I'll still keep an eye out for a   silver lining when it reports its full fourth-quarter earnings on   Feb. 22.10 stocks we like better than FitbitWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered excellent earnings news Jan. 31 that pushed Apple stock to its highest level since the summer of 2015.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's great news for long time owners of Apple stock who've had to suffer through a deluge of naysayers proclaiming its lack of innovation. More than a few have even suggestedinvestors dump AAPL stockand buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in its place.Hey, I like Microsoft and I think what it'sdoing in the cloudis going to help it continue to grow over the next decade, but it's not in the same league when it comes to revenue and profit growth. Microsoft does, however, have a business model that's transitioning from one-time product sales to ongoing monthly recurring revenue, something many observers have noted is happening at Apple.Yes, Apple did sell more than78 millioniPhones in the first quarter, roughly five million more than it sold in the same quarter a year earlier, but it was the service revenue that had everyone in a tizzy.Jim Cramer likened the Apple business model tothe Gillette business model, where consumers buy a single razor and keep buying new razor blades; only in Apple's situation the iPhone is the razor and services such as the App Stores are the razor blades.You gotta love recurring revenue. Cramer does:""What has dogged Apple's stock for ages, what has kept its share price so low, at least in terms of its valuation, is the 'Blackberry-ization' issue,"" Cramer said onMad MoneyFeb. 1. ""The notion that in the end, the iPhone is just a device and device companies eventually get wasted asBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) did.""7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThere's no question recurring revenue is good for a company's top and bottom line and should be welcome news for owners of Apple stock, but is it enough to drive Apple stock through its all-time high of $134.54 and upward to $200?That's debatable.While Apple's services revenue hit$7.2 billionin the first quarter, 18% higher than a year earlier, it's still only 9% of the company's overall revenue, or 100 basis points higher than a year earlier.By comparison, Microsoft's second quarter saw its service and other revenueincreased 29.7% to $7.5 billion. The only problem with that for Microsoft is the gross margins are 40% compared to 67.5% for its product revenue, which accounted for 68.5% of its overall revenue.You want your recurring revenue gross margins to be higher than your product margins, not lower; because if that's the way the world is headed, both stocks are looking at lower profits in the future.Apple doesn't break down its gross margins between products and segments. Overall, its gross margin in Q1 2017 was 38.5%, 160 basis points less than in Q1 2016. Microsoft's overall gross margin in its latest quarter was 58.9%, considerably higher than Apple's.That would seem to suggest Microsoft's in a better position when it comes to service revenue. It is both growing this aspect of its business faster than Apple and making more from every dollar of revenue. From this perspective, Apple is doomed.A quick look farther down the income statement, however, provides some clarity: Apple's operating margin in Q1 2017 was 29.9%; Microsoft's Q2 2017 operating margin was 25.7%, or 420 basis points less than Apple.The biggest reason for this difference: Microsoft spends about three times as much per year on research and development as Apple does; Apple spent 4.7% of its revenue in the trailing 12 months on R&D compared to 14.4% for Microsoft. And when you're talking about billions of dollars of annual revenue, the difference adds up quickly.Which brings us back to Apple's growing service revenue: InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon highlightedthe positives of Apple's services revenuerecently. A couple of his points stick out for me.Don't Bet Against the Dow Jones Industrial AverageFirst, the App Store had $3 billion in revenue in December - a record. Secondly, Apple paid out more than $20 billion to developers in 2016. Extrapolate December's App Store sales over 12 months and you get $36 billion in revenue. Subtract $20 billion paid to developers in 2016 and that leaves a gross profit of $16 billion and a gross margin of 44%, which is pretty darn healthy considering very little R&D is required to keep that up and running.Can recurring revenue take Apple stock to $200? I believe it can. When, however, is another story.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush Investors9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postHere's How Apple Inc.

Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock — What Happened?;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnly a few years ago,Xiaomiwas worryingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) investors. Xiaomi had become the world's third-largest smartphone manufacturer and was expanding into other products like fitness trackers, TVs and video streamers. It was valued at $45 billion, hired a prominent executive away fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and planned an expansion into America.makeArticleAd();Source: XiaomiToday? It has dropped out of the top five smartphone vendors list, marketshare in China has plummeted, the Google exec has jumped ship and some analysts are valuing the company as low as $3.6 billion.What happened to Xiaomi and is its threat to Apple truly neutralized? Or are the troubled Chinese tech giant's plans merely on hold?Xiaomi's Rapid RisePrivately held Xiaomi was founded in 2010, released its first smartphone in 2011 and rapidly gained popularity in China. The company offered high-quality in its smartphones, with low pricing -a combination that led to it being the top-selling smartphone brand in China by 2014.It came seemingly out of nowhere to capture thethird place spot for worldwide smartphone salesthat year as well. The feat was especially impressive given that Xiaomi was not selling its phones in the U.S. market.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Like Apple, Google andSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the company wanted to expand into consumer electronics in general. That effort included the inexpensive Mi Band fitness tracker that vaulted Xiaomi intosecond place worldwide for wearable salesby 2015, behind onlyFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).The company pursued a strategy of investing in hardware startups, buying into dozens of companies making everything from smart lighting to headphones and TVs. While these products are not always Xiaomi-branded, they are designed to all work well together.It also added software and services to the mix.Chinese CompetitionThe success of Xiaomi spurred homegrown competition. Other Chinese manufacturers stepped up to the plate and followed Xiaomi's formula. However, they did a better job of marketing to increasingly demanding Chinese consumers by charging a little more but offering more striking designs. One of these companies -Huawei- was good enough that Googlepartnered with it to build the Nexus 6P smartphone in 2015. Xiaomi's phones seem lower quality than these competitors and rather than innovative, its designs are often seen as being too similar to Apple's.At this point, Xiaomi has been leapfrogged by its Chinese smartphone rivals. While Xiaomi has dropped off the global top five smartphone manufacturer list, China's Huawei,OppoandVivocurrently hold the third, fourth and fifth places.American ObstaclesKey to Xiaomi's ambitions were an expansion into the U.S. market. To lead that effort, thecompany hired Hugo Barra- the VP who oversaw Android product management - from Google.However, Xiaomi's U.S. push has failed to materialize. There are dozens of products Xiaomi offers online through itsMi Store(which carries only a fraction of Xiaomi's and its partner companies' gear), including eight different smartphone models, multiple smart TVs, VR headsets and even a self-balancing electric scooter. U.S. customers are limited to being able to buy a few sets of earbuds, a pair of headphones, a battery pack and a Bluetooth speaker.A big part of the problem in moving into the U.S. market is that Xiaomi has taken advantage of China's relatively lax approach to patents. In late 2014, it wasbanned from selling smartphones in Indiaas a result of a patent infringement ruling (it has since resumed Indian operations). If Xiaomi tried to push into the U.S. with its smartphones at this point, there's a good chance Apple and other tech companies would sue it into oblivion.In an attempt to defend against this scenario, Xiaomi has begun buying up patents. Last year,it purchased 1,500 patentsfromMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) relating to areas like wireless communication, multimedia and video, and the cloud.No Longer a Threat to Apple?At this point, Xiaomi is a paper tiger that isvalued at as little as $3.6 billion. In 2015, it sold 70 million-plus smartphones, missing its initial goal of 100 million and then the revised goal of 80 million. It's refusing to say how many it sold in 2016, but that silence speaks volumes.Hugo Barra bailed on the companya few weeks ago, joiningFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). A few months before leaving, he toldReutersthat lower smartphone sales wouldn't impact the companybecause it made no money on them:""Basically we're giving [handsets] to you without making any money… we care about the recurring revenue streams over many years. We could sell 10 billion smartphones and we wouldn't make a single dime in profits.""The problem with that approach is that as of 2015,smartphones still accounted for 95% of the company's revenue. All those other products and services just don't seem to be sticking.Barra also told reporters not to expect Xiaomi to release a smartphone in the U.S. in 2017.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformXiaomi CEO Lei Junposted a letter to employeeson Facebook in January. In it, he admitted the company had pushed ahead too fast, cutting into its long-term growth, but says the worst is over.The company's revenue target is RMB 100 billion (roughly $14.5 billion) -the same as its 2015 target. In trying to be so much, so fast, Xiaomi has set itself up for some very challenging times. If treading water is the goal it has set for itself, Apple doesn't have much to worry about.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postXiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc.

Tech Companies Take a Stand Against Trump's Immigration Ban;2/6/2017;"Immigration has been a driving force behind many of the   leading technology companies in the United States.Some, includingMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , are led by CEOs who were not born in this   country while over 200 companies on the Fortune 500 were started   by immigrants or their children. In addition most top tech brands   are global, with offices all over the world, and talent working   domestically that was not born in the U.S.At least partly because of that nearly 100 technology   companies including Microsoft,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Facebook,Twitter, and many others have filed a legal brief in the U.S. Court of   Appeals for the 9th Circuit opposing President Donald Trump's   temporary immigration ban keeping people from seven predominantly   Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In the brief the   companies argue that the ban ""inflicts significant harm on   American business.""makeArticleAd();Trump signed an executive order banning immigration from     seven predominantly Muslim countries. Image source: Getty     Images.What are they opposing?In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an   executive order banning refugees and visa-holders from seven   predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.   That order has been stayed by aU.S. District judgeand an appeals courtdeclined to immediately reinstatethe presidential order. The technology companies, many of which   operate and employ workers in and from the impacted countries   filed their brief to show their opposition to the president's   actions.""Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries,   and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic   companies,"" the brief states. ""America has long recognized the   importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us   harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental   commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased   background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter   our country.""The companies that signed the brief acknowledged what Trump   was, at least on the surface, trying to accomplish with the   executive order.""We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system   meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,"" said a   draft of that letter obtained byBloomberg News. ""We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order   will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United   States and contribute to our country's success.""Tech requires global talentPutting aside any political questions, the tech industry   opposes Trump's immigration ban in part because it takes global   talent to compete. The U.S. simply does not produce enough   workers -- specifically coders who write the software that powers   the products made by these companies -- to meet demand.To fill those needs companies across the U.S. use H1B visas to   receive special dispensation to hire workers who otherwise would   not be able to legally work in the country. A H1B visa, according   toMyVisaJobs.com, allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign   professionals in specialty occupations for three years,   extendable to six years. ""To qualify for H1B Visa, the foreign   professional must hold a bachelor's or higher degree from an   accredited college or university in the specialty occupation,""   according to the site. In some cases specialized training can be   substituted for a degree.Technology companies dominate the list of employers using   workers on H1B visas. Data compiled by MyVisaJobs.com shows that   in 2016 Infosys held the top spot, having sponsored 25,405 visas.   while Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet were all in the top 25.It's about more than self interestIt's easy to see the business reasons behind why these   technology companies oppose Trump's immigration restrictions.   Most, if not all of the companies that filed the brief would be   impacted by having employees unable to travel and in some cases   the executive order would impact hiring.For at least some of these companies, however, the opposition   goes beyond pure business logic. Many of these brands were either   founded by immigrants or by the children of immigrants and   immediate business concerns aside, they simply want a world where   new immigrants to the U.S. can be free to move here and found the   next Microsoft, Apple, or Alphabet.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Stock Market News for February 06, 2017;2/6/2017;"President Donald Trump's recent steps to reduce regulations related to the financial sector and an encouraging jobs report led benchmarks to end in the green on Friday. Optimism over Trump's financial de-regulation actions boosted bank stocks, which in turn led the Dow to register its best gains for the year. Moreover, a record number of jobs were created last month, which also had a positive impact on investor sentiment.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.9%, or 186.55 points, to close at 20,071.46. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to close at 2,297.42. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,666.77, gaining 0.5%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 8.1% to settle at 10.97. A total of around 6.45 billion shares were traded Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.71 billion. Advancers significantly outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 76% stocks that advanced, 21% declined.Dow Register Best Gain in 2017The Dow registered its best gain so far this year on the back of Trump's latest move to scale back financial regulations as well as strong job gains. Also, the blue-chip index rallied past the psychological level of 20,000 once again. Further, the tech-based Nasdaq closed at a new record high.The President signed an executive order that directs the Secretary of the Treasury to assess the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation. The order directs the Treasury Secretary to ""consult with the heads of the member agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council"" and ""report to the President within 120 days"" regarding any necessary legislative recommendations or regulatory changes.The order also outlines the core principles of his administration regarding regulation of the financial system. If passed by Congress, it could lead to the replacement of the Dodd Frank law with a new set of rules.Positive sentiment over Trump's latest steps on financial de-regulation led the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) to rise 2%, which was the best performing sector among the S&P 500. Key component from this sector like Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) increased 5.5%, 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively.

This figure also exceeds December's reading of 157,000. Additionally, these are the best monthly job gains since September.However, expectations that the economy is moving towards a full employment scenario weighed on workers pay, with average hourly wages rising only 0.1% in January, lower than December's downwardly revised gain of 0.2%. Further, the unemployment rate, meantime, ticked up to 4.8% from 4.7% in January.In other economic news, the Institute for Supply Management reported that ISM Services Index fell to 56.5% in January. Meanwhile, factory orders rebounded in January by increasing 1.3% after decline in December.Weekly RoundupFor the week, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 0.1% while the Dow fell 0.1%. Upbeat earnings from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Fed's positive view of the economy boosted two of the benchmarks. However, investors grappled over President Trump's order to tighten immigration rules during the week. Trump's approach on foreign trade and policies also dented investor sentiment, which in turn weighed on the Dow.Stocks That Made HeadlinesNewell Q4 Earnings In Line, Sales Lag; EPS View     UpNewell Brands Inc.(NWL) came up with fourth-quarter 2016 results, wherein adjusted earnings per share were in line with expectations while sales lagged estimates.

Newly introduced immigration rules led to protests, criticism and legal challenges. Additionally, the tech sector expressed concerns over the impact these regulations would have on their businesses. Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy also led to widespread heartburn and dampened investor sentiment.Last Week's PerformanceThe index declined 0.6% on Monday as investors' grappled over President Trump's order to tighten immigration rules. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Such an executive order spawned legal challenges, congressional criticism and widespread protests. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore good for stocks.The Dow logged its worst daily loss since mid-October on Monday, while a popular measure of Wall Street fear climbed to its highest level in about three months. Consumer spending increased 0.5% in December, matching the consensus estimate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The index declined 0.5% on Tuesday amid signs that momentum following President Donald Trump's election victory in November was fading. His signing of an executive order to temporary restrict immigration saw weekend chaos and backlash, eventually affecting stocks. Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years.Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013. The Dow added 0.5% for the month of January. Projections for stronger economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings boosted US stocks for the first January rise in five years. Stocks rallied on hopes that the new administration's policies including lowering of taxes and cutting regulations will bolster economic growth.The materials sector has fueled the rally, advancing 5.1% so far this year, following a 14% gain in 2016. Technology shares that trailed behind the broader market last year have also recorded sharp gains this year. The sector has risen 3.6% in January, its best month since last July. Earnings in the final quarter of 2016 came on the heels of growth in the third quarter that snapped a 15-month decline in earnings.The index gained 0.1% on Wednesday after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), the largest U.S. company by market cap, reported upbeat earnings. Meanwhile, the Fed ended its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and revealed that measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. But the Fed kept rates unchanged within a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't give any sign that it would raise rates in its next meeting in March, putting the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group. The ISM manufacturing index climbed to 56% last month from 54.5% in December, marking the fifth straight gain and also its highest level since end 2014.The index declined a meager 0.03% on Thursday after President Donald Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy dented investor sentiment. Investors grappled over Trump's executive order to tighten immigration rules, while the White House warned Iran that the country could face new sanctions over a recent ballistic missile test. Trump also labelled a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a ""dumb deal"" and reiterated concerns about trade ties with Mexico.Components Moving the IndexApple's first quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion.

Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Visa Inc (V);2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as last week's earnings and jobs euphoria has failed to carry over into premarket action this morning. Furthermore, Wall Street is wary ahead of key economic data from the White House, as President Trump is s required to submit a preliminary budget proposal to Congress on the first Monday of February. Investors are waiting to see just how Trump's campaign promises for massive infrastructure spending and tax cuts will take shape.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.21%, whileS&P 500futures are off 0.23% and theNasdaq-100futures are down 0.22%.On the options front, 3 Feb. options expiration drove heavy volume on Friday, as a wealth of earnings speculation finally came to a head. On the day, some 18.6 million calls and 14.7 million puts changed hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.68 while the 10-day moving average held at a three-month high of 0.69.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) attracted a surge in call activity ahead of President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at rolling back financial regulations - setting the stage for the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act. Elsewhere,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) calls were also wildly popular after new broke that the company would begin assembling iPhones in India by the end of April. Finally,Visa Inc(NYSE:V) jumped more than 4.5% after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Bank of America Corp (BAC)Months of speculation came to an end on Friday, whenPresident Trump took steps to roll back regulationson the financial industry - setting the stage for banks like Bank of America to begin unrestricted share buybacks and dividend increases. What's more, financial industry analysts believe that if regulation rollbacks are on the table for banks, then corporate tax cuts can't be far behind, as they were also among Trump's campaign promises.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99BAC stock has been itching for such news for weeks now, with investors banking on deregulation and the possibility of increased dividends given BofA's strong performance in 2016. As a result, BAC options traders flooded the stock with calls on Friday, with these typically bullish bets making up 77% of the 1.3 million contracts traded.Taking a broader look at short-term BAC speculation, the February/March put/call open interest ratio has plunged in recent weeks to a perch at 0.50, with calls doubling puts among contracts set to expire within the next two months. Currently, the most popular strike is the March $25 call, where more than 174,000 contracts reside. This strike rests about 7.3% out of the money and last traded at an ask price of 20 cents, or $20 per contract.Apple Inc. (AAPL)According to news on Friday, Apple has finally broken through into India's massive mobile market. Apple will startmaking iPhones in India by the end of April, with Taiwan'sWistron Corp.assembling the phones in Bangalore, said Priyank Kharge, the state's information technology minister. Apple had requested a contentious 15-year tax holiday to import components and equipment, but ministry officials refused to comment on any incentives in the deal.Call option volume on AAPL stock surged to well above normal levels following the news. Overall, some 1.03 million contracts traded on Apple, with calls gobbling up 71% of the day's take.That said, there is still plenty of room for additional call activity on AAPL, with the stock's February/March put/call OI ratio arriving at 0.85, with the March $125 arriving as the most popular calls strike with more than 81,000 calls in residence. This reading has begun to drift lower during the past week, and Friday's India news should help spur additional call activity this week.Visa Inc (V)Visa is ""everywhere investors should want to be,""Cowen and Company told investorsafter the former's strong quarterly earnings report. After the close on Thursday, Visa posted first-quarter earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $4.5 billion, easily topping estimates for 78 cents per share on sales of $4.3 billion. Visa also lifted its 2017 earnings outlook.Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Will Test Your PatienceFollowing the report, V stock jumped roughly 4.6% to trade at a fresh all-time high just shy of $86 per share. Options traders signaled they expected additional gains from V stock, as volume rose to 223,000 contracts with calls snapping up 77% of the day's take. Calls have begun to add up for V stock, with the February/March put/call OI ratio falling to a reading of 0.66 on Friday.That said, there is some trepidation in the March series, where peak call OI of 13,000 contracts rests at the in-the-money $80 strike. Look for V options traders to roll these calls higher if the stock can maintain Friday's momentum.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth Potential5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe postMonday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc.

Below are five must-read quotes from the   call.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();On diversifying the businessOne of the biggest knocks against Skyworks is that the company   is overly reliant onApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .

Here's what CEO Liam Griffin had to say about the company's   growth excluding its ""largest customer"":Our growth and success outside of our largest customer has     been outstanding. Huawei became the No. 2 account for us this     last quarter. They're going to continue to be one of our     leaders. We have our customer in Korea who will continue to     grow significantly into 2017. And our largest customers will     set up very well for us as well, as we address some very     complex architectures with compelling products. So we feel     really good about that on the mobile side.And then let me remind you that the broad market portfolio,     from infrastructure to IoT [Internet of Things] to early stages     of automotive, all look good, and the staff there are     double-digit year over year.CEO Griffin also rattled off several examples of new-design   wins or expanding relationships with these other customers.   Specifically, he called out relationships with companies such asComcast,Netgear,Ubiquiti Networks, Xiaomi, ""multiple tier 1 OEMs,"" among others.On returning to year-over-year growthApple's decision in 2016 to reduce its channel inventory   levels had a big impact on Skyworks. In fact, Skyworks revenuedeclinedyear over year in each of the last three quarterly reports, which   isn't something that growth investors like to see.Thankfully, CFO Kris Sennesael says that the days of declining   sales growth are over:I think we've weathered a bit of a storm here in 2016 and     most of the clouds there have abated. And it's not just market     shifts. We're gaining share, we're creating new content, we're     expanding in IoT and in broad markets, and it's meaningful, and     it's sustainable. We're confident that the second half for us     ... should be a double-digit growth rate year-over-year.For the upcoming quarter, management is guiding for revenue   growth of 8% and earnings-per-share growth of 12%. That's got to   make bulls smile from ear to ear.On the next phase of growthIt is possible that smartphone sales are nearing a plateau, so   Skyworks likes to remind investors that a few technologies will   be hitting the mass market soon that could drive the company's   next phase of growth. Specifically, management remains   uber-bullish on the opportunities that will be opened up once 5G   network technology and autonomous driving become a part of   everyday life.Here's CEO Griffin talking about the potential of 5G network   technology:[M]arket projections suggest 5G data rates will approach 10x     the speed of current 4G and LTE systems. To put this in     perspective, downloading a full-length HD movie in 3G took 1     day. In 4G the same file took minutes. On a 5G network, this     content will be downloaded in mere seconds.And Griffin commenting on the extreme data needs of autonomous   vehicles:Looking out over the next few years, the amount of data that     will be delivered to and from the car is estimated to be 5 to     10 times more than the bandwidth used by today's smartphone.     For instance, by 2020, a single autonomous car is expected to     consume 4,000 gigabits of data per day in real-time     diagnostics, positioning, vehicle-to-vehicle communications.     And that's equivalent to the daily data consumed by more than     2,000 smartphone users in 2017.On taking care of shareholdersSkyworks has been returning its excess capital to shareholders   for years in the form of buybacks and dividend payments. Here's   CFO Sennesael commenting on the company's recent actions to   continue to reward shareholders:We are definitely committed to continuing to return cash to     the shareholder with our dividend program and our share buyback     program. We returned $106 million in Q1, repurchasing 1.4     million shares in Q1.And so we have now put in place a new $500 million program.     Historically, we have been returning 40%, 50% of our free cash     flow to the shareholders, and so that's something that we will     continue to do so.All in all, Skyworks delivered an excellent quarter, and   provided shareholders with plenty of reasons to remain   optimistic.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

There were the 200 quadcopters fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) that were part of Lady Gaga's halftime show. Those we were expecting, but another drone that showed up was a surprise.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) chose the Super Bowl to tease Amazon Prime Air - packages delivered to your home by AMZN drones.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA big part of the Super Bowl experience is the advertising. This is the one time of year when viewers actuallywantto see commercials. And with those viewersestimated at over 100 million, companies that forked out over $5 million for a 30-second spot make a big splash.Heck, even in Canada, the networks wereforced to run American adsinstead of substituting local commercials.And those 100 million-plus viewers saw a very short teaser commercial with anAmazon drone hoveringoutside the window of a woman who had just ordered some snacks: Amazon Prime Air.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAccording to the voice of Alexa, AMZN's personal digital assistant, we can ""Look for delivery soon.""History of Amazon Prime AirHow can you talk about the history of a service that doesn't yet exist? In the case of Amazon Prime Air and its use of Amazon drones, there's already a big backstory to talk about. AMZNhas a websitewhere it describes the services, shows off a number of Amazon drone videos and even has an FAQ section that spikes out many of the details about Amazon Prime Air.""We're excited about Prime Air - a delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones. Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.""The Amazon Prime Air storykicked off in 2013, when AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos took the wraps off a top secret project with Amazon drones on60 Minutes. Delivery of items under five pounds that would fit in the quadcopter's bucket would take place in under 30 minutes. At the time, Bezos told viewers to expect Amazon Prime Air within four to five years.Last December, a milestone was reached when AMZN claimedthe first Amazon drone delivery- an Amazon Fire TV and a bag of popcorn. As part of an Amazon Prime Air trial in the U.K., the company's drones had begun autonomously delivering packages to a very small group of consumers.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!At the end of the year, the company hit the news again when it was discovered it hadfiled a patent for a flying warehousethat would serve as an airborne base for Amazon drone deliveries.When Can You Expect an Amazon Drone atYourWindow?Despite the Super Bowl ad and Alexa's promise that Amazon Prime Air is coming soon, it's a little early to get excited yet. In particular, there are regulatory hurdles to overcome. FAA restrictions on drones that aren't flying in line-of-site operation were the primary reason why the Amazon drone trial is taking place in the U.K. instead of here. AMZN even put up a small disclaimer on its ad:""Prime Air is not available in some states (or any really). Yet.""But the fact that it spent the big Super Bowl ad bucks and showed off that Amazon drone to millions of viewers shows AMZN is serious about this. Amazon Prime Air may not be launching tomorrow, but the company is determined to get people excited about drone delivery. The campaign to turn Amazon drone delivery into the next big thing has officially begun.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfThe postAmazon.com, Inc.

Let's take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:XLG in FocusThis fund offers exposure to mega cap securities with key holdings in information technology.

No, Google's Brand Is Not More Valuable Than Apple's;2/5/2017;"Last week, Brand Finance came out with itsannual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared   thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost its supremacy toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google.Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of   innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful.   Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand   in terms of total value.Is Apple turning sour?While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most   valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative   view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report:makeArticleAd();However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their     faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost     to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its     technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its     advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected.Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its     customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from     newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate     that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are     in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now     compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with     traditional rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , but a slew of Chinese brands such as     Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source     of profitability.As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its   estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to   $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at   $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand   Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things,   to justify the big increase in its brand value.Consumers are paying more and more for iPhonesBrand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is   contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for   iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone   sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average   selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695.The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image     source: Apple.In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released   the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP   had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to   continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing   stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to   the massive value of its brand.Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down.   Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become   known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at   near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command   a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond   smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates   that its brand is as strong as ever.Apple is a profit machineAccording to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a   technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many   tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has   overtaken Apple in terms of innovation.Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even   technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly   similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being   true.Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of   smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million   shipments for Samsung,according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just   $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating   profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion.On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone   business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way   you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than   Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating   profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for   Samsung's mobile division.)If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung,   its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50   billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's   more than double Alphabet'stotalannual operating profit of $23.7 billion.Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close   to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the   traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a   long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of   profit every year.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. Has Big Plans for Its Fast-Growing Services Business;2/4/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is primarily a hardware company. Most of its   revenue comes from the sale of iPhone, iPad, and Mac products.   Beyond those key product categories, the company generates   meaningful revenue from its Apple Watch family of smartwatch   products, as well as from the various accessories, such as its   well-received AirPod line of wireless earbuds.Apple music running on different Apple products. Image     source: Apple.makeArticleAd();However, one of the most exciting parts of the company's   portfolio is the services business, which the company says   ""includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare,   Apple Pay, licensing and other services.""This segment has been on a robust growth path for quite some   time, with revenue here growing 10% in the company's fiscal year   2015 and then a whopping 22% in fiscal year 2016. In the   company's most recent quarter, it reported that services revenue   was up another 18% year-over-year.This isn't a small business, either -- at least in absolute   terms. It generated more than $24 billion in the company's last   fiscal year, making up more than 10% of the company's   consolidated revenue. To really put it into proper perspective,   services was Apple's second-largest business by revenue in 2016   -- bigger than the iPad and Mac.On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook made   public the company's vision for services over the next four   years, and it's quite ambitious.Doubling revenue in just four years""Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we   expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this   year"", Cook said.Cook then went on to say that Apple ""feel[s] great about this   momentum"" and that the company aims to ""double the size of [its]   Services business in the next four years"".Of course, what Apple's goals are and what happens aren't   necessarily the same thing, but the fact that management is   willing to put a growth figure out there -- a hard number that   investors will now hold Apple accountable for -- speaks to the   company's confidence.What would a doubling of this business mean?Put simply, doubling the business from the revenue levels seen   in 2016 would mean that, by 2020, Apple's services business will   be bringing in about $48 billion. If Apple can get the business   to that scale and then grow it at a modest rate from that point   forward (perhaps 5% to 10% annually), then that would do wonders   for Apple's longer-term revenue growth prospects.What's not entirely clear, however, is how that growth will   translate into incremental profitability. CFO Luca Maestri said   on the call that, on average, the gross profit margin of Services   businesses ishigherthan the corporate average, so an increase in Services mix should   help Apple on the gross profit margin front.That said, as Apple scales up its services revenue, it will   likely need to drive up operating expenses associated with the   business, as well. While I do expect nice growth in profitability   from a boost in services, the incremental gross profit isn't all   flowing to the bottom line.At the end of the day, if Apple hits its growth target with   respect to this growing segment, it should be less dependent on   the iPhone and could ultimately see earnings multiple expansion   as software/services companies tend to be valued more by   investors than pure hardware plays.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Donald Trump Target Share Buybacks Next?;2/4/2017;"Donald Trump. Image source: Whitehouse.gov.President Donald Trump has taken several bold steps since   taking office, but one area seems to be a bigger priority than   any other. Trump has been adamant about getting American   companies to invest in the U.S. by building factories and plants   and hiring American workers. In his inaugural address, he   declared that as a central theme of his presidency, imploring   American companies to ""buy American and hire American.""makeArticleAd();Before he even took the oath of office, Trump said he had   struck a deal withUnited Technologies'Carrier Industries to keep about 800 jobs in Indiana that were   slated to go to Mexico. He pressured other manufacturers like   automakers to keep jobs in the country, and may have influencedFord'sdecision to scrap plans for a new plant in Mexico.Once in office, Trump backed out of the Trans Pacific   Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal, and met with leaders of the   Big 3 automakers to urge them to expand in the U.S.While those moves may help curry the favor of Trump's base,   their effect on investment in the U.S. is uncertain. The   automakers already believe that the auto market is at its   cyclical peak, as last year marked a record for vehicle sales,   and they are therefore reluctant to invest in new factories.Manufacturing jobs have certainly declined over the past   generation, but analysts tend to blame that on automation rather   than outsourcing.Trump has supported tax breaks that would encourage companies   to bring back money kept overseas. Some see this as step one to   getting the companies to invest in American jobs. Others see it   as priming the companies to use the money to buy back their own   shares. Larry Fink, BlackRock founder and CEO and a member of   Trump's ""President's Strategic and Policy Forum,"" recently warned   that companies should only engage in buybacks ""when they are   confident that the return on those buybacks will ultimately   exceed the cost of capital and the long-term returns of investing   in future growth.""Fink mentioned Trump by name twice in his Jan. 24annual letter to CEOs, saying in part:If tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation     for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be     looking to companies' strategic frameworks for an explanation     of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S., and if so,     how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share     buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately     balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently     investing for future growth?President Trump has indicated an interest in infrastructure     investment, which has the dual benefits of improving overall     productivity and creating jobs, especially for workers     displaced by technology.Fink went on to write that infrastructure investing is not a   solution to automation taking jobs, saying ""businesses will need   to increase the earnings potential of the workers who drive   returns, helping the employee who once operated a machine learn   to program it.""Trump has showed himself committed to American jobs. We don't   know if he will use his bully pulpit to try to force companies to   forgo buybacks, but he might if he follows the logic that doing   so would result in the companies instead putting the money to use   in ways that would boost American workers. Let's take a look at   the issue.A Wall Street favoriteShare repurchases, orbuybacks, in which a company buys share of its own stock, were once   illegal, as they were seen as facilitating insider trading   because a company could act on information not available to the   public. The SEC changed the rule in 1982, and since then, stock   buybacks have become increasingly popular. According toHSBC, American companies have spent $2.1 trillion on repurchases over   the last five years.Often called a form of financial engineering by detractors,   share buybacks boost a company's earnings per share, not by   increasing earnings, but by reducing the number of shares   outstanding. The pie is split among fewer shares. Investors to   tend to cheer share buybacks due to the lift they give to stock   prices, but from a larger economic perspective, and possibly from   Donald Trump's point of view, they may be the least efficient   form of spending cash.Image source: Getty Images.By allocating money to buy back shares, business are choosing   to spend profits on inflating earnings per share instead of   potentially investing in the long-term growth of the business by   opening new plants, hiring or training new workers, investing in   research and development, or even acquiring other companies.   Unlike dividends, the other from of returning capital to   shareholders, buybacks don't give money to current shareholders   that can be reinvested, and they do not add market value to the   company, which is based in part on the number of shares   outstanding. In other words, no value is being created by   repurchases in the aggregate.  Share repurchases are   controversial for a number of reasons, but their ability to   dissuade companies from investing in long-term growth is   certainly one of the biggest.How the pros do itWith interest rates especially low in recent years, many   companies have taken on debt, not to expand their businesses, but   to reward shareholders with buybacks.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) founder Steve Jobs refused to pay a dividend,   believing that it meant the company was out of ideas. He also   didn't authorize share repurchases.Apple under Tim Cook, however, has taken out $87 billion in   debt to fund repurchases, reducing the share count by 1.3 billion   in the process, and spending about $125 billion in the process.   Part of the reason Apple has done so is because much of its cash   is parked overseas and it wants to avoid repatriation taxes, but   one could see the Trump administration cutting a deal with the   iPhone maker to reduce or eliminate repatriation taxes if it   agreed to invest in jobs in the U.S.Apple, with nearly $200 billion overseas, has been demanding   such an arrangement for years, and could be willing to invest   some of that cash in the U.S. if the tax rate was significantly   reduced. Notably FoxConn, its biggest supplier, said it was   considering opening a plant in Pennsylvania that would employ   50,000 Americans. Apple is unlikely itself to invest in domestic   manufacturing, but since FoxConn assembles iPhones and other   Apple products, if it opened a plant in Pennsylvania, it would   mean that some Apple products would be made in America, though   outsourced to a Chinese company.Trump has said he would like to make deals with corporations   to bring some of their overseas cash back home, though that would   likely come with stipulations.Goldman Sachspredicted Trump's tax and repatriation plans would encourage more   buybacks as it frees up cash for companies, but BlackRock's Fink   scolded corporations in his recent letter for spending so much on   buybacks.He noted that the total thatS&P 500companies have spent on dividends and buybacks in the last   12 months is greater than the operating profits they've   earned. With $5 trillion in assets under management, the   Blackrock CEO's missives attract attention on Wall Street, and if   he gets the President's ear, Trump could end up using the bully   pulpit to excoriate big business for its excessive buybacks.IBM's(NYSE: IBM) recent misadventures perhaps best illustrate the   folly of buybacks. After outlining a goal in 2010 of reaching $20   in earnings per share (EPS) by 2015, Big Blue spent aggressively   on repurchases to pump up EPS to meet that target, pouring $70   billion between 2010-2014 into lowering its share count. As a   result, however, the business suffered.Revenue at the tech giant has now fallen for 19 quarters in a   row, and the company was forced to step back from its $20 EPS   goal in 2014. In 2016, adjusted EPS was just $13.59, down 9% from   the previous year. In the meantime, IBM has also slashed   headcount as the number of employees has fallen by close to   100,000, since its peak in 2014, to 368,000. Considering Big   Blue's decision to use profits to reward investors while laying   off employees, the company would seem to be a target ripe for   Trump's ire.It's not just tech companies that are using this tactic, as   manufacturers likeGM, Ford, andCaterpillarhave all been spending on share repurchases recently.Any attempt by the Trump administration to tackle share   repurchases would likely rankle Wall Street, which favors the   practice. But as the president looks for more levers to pull to   boost the ""forgotten men and women"" of America, share buybacks   may start to look like a worthy target.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Why This 1 Number Is So Important to Apple Investors;2/3/2017;"Image source: Apple.The iPhone is by far the most important product inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) lineup. The device accounted for over 69% of the   company's first-quarter sales. After three consecutive quarters   of unit sales declines, Apple righted the ship with the release   of the iPhone 7 last fall, driving a near-5% increase in unit   sales.makeArticleAd();But more important than the growth in units is Apple's ability   to sell its higher-end device, the iPhone 7 Plus. CEO Tim Cook   revealed the newest model was the best selling Plus model it's   released yet during the company's first-quarter earnings call.   The ability to sell higher-end devices is key for the company   going forward as it becomes increasingly difficult to grow unit   sales.A look at selling pricesData source: Apple quarterly reports.The first thing that stands out in the chart above is the huge   drop in average sales price (ASP) during the previous three   quarters. The drop coincides with the release of the lower-priced   iPhone SE, which starts at just $399. After a late second-quarter   release, sales of the model seemed to peak in the third quarter,   resulting in a low $595 ASP for all iPhone units.Apple also faced significant foreign exchange headwinds over   the past year. CFO Luca Maestri noted the dollar has strengthened   25% against the basket of currencies where Apple does business   since June 2014. That led Apple to raise some of its prices in   foreign countries last year.But more iPhone shoppers opted for the high-end iPhone 7 Plus   last quarter, leading to a record ASP of $695. That's even more   astonishing considering the inclusion of the iPhone SE in those   sales.What's so telling about the popularity of the iPhone 7   Plus?Unlike in the two previous Plus models of the iPhone, the 7   Plus included a higher-end camera compared to its   smaller-screened sister. That point of differentiation may be   what led more consumers to opt for the more expensive device last   quarter.The significant demand for the 7 Plus shows that Apple has the   potential to drive sales growth by further differentiating the   Plus lineup from the standard iPhone model. Instead of just   offering a larger screen, Apple can keep its best innovations   exclusively for its highest-paying customers before letting them   trickle down to the lower-priced models.Such a move would strengthen the position of the Plus model in   the simple good, better, best price positioning Apple uses. Just   as importantly, the upsell is easy thanks to installment plans --   just $4 more per month gets you the best ever phone, camera,   mobile gaming machine, Snapchat device, and so on.But don't get excited just yetThere's no doubt that Apple benefited from one of its biggest   competitors running into some technical difficulties late last   year.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) had to recall its Galaxy Note 7 after units   started randomly exploding due to battery malfunctions.Many Note 7 customers likely ended up buying an iPhone 7 Plus   for its similarly sized screen. Cook noted it saw the highest   Android switcher rate of any quarter.Obviously, Apple can't rely on Samsung or one of its other   major competitors having problems with their large-screen phones   every quarter. That's why investors must pay attention to the   iPhone ASP going forward to see if last quarter was a fluke or if   Apple's differentiation strategy is paying off. If ASP continues   to rise, it could bode well if Apple further differentiates its   newest Plus model even more from the standard model in the   fall.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why 2 Well-Known Tech Companies Are Making Significant AI Acquisitions;2/3/2017;"With the race for artificial intelligence (AI) shifting into   high gear, companies are not only developing AI systems in-house,   but are increasingly bringing start-ups into the fold to augment   their efforts. Market intelligence firm CB Insights released its   list ofAI acquisitionsover the last five years. A review of the most active acquirers   can provide insight into future developments at those companies,   and show how the new technologies are being integrated.Artificial intelligence acquisitions are skyrocketing. Image     source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();One intriguing revelation is that many of the acquired   companies work in the areas of deep learning and machine   learning, two disciplines within AI. Algorithms and software are   used to develop models of the human brain called neural networks,   attempting to recreate our capacity to learn. Another revelation   is that much of the acquired technology can be directly   integrated intovirtual personal assistants. This is an area of great interest to big tech, but is alsobeing pursuedby a surprising number ofother companies.Apple is on an AI buying spree. Image source: Author.Apple is giving Siri a makeoverApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been at the leading edge of AI since its   introduction of Siri five years ago. While it is making a   significant number of acquisitions, each appears to specialize in   a different area:VocalIQ concentrated its deep-learning capabilities to     better understand human speech. This could provide Siri with an     upgrade.Perceptio can run neural-network algorithms and perform     advanced calculations locally on a cellphone, without uploading     user data to the cloud. This would help Apple protect consumer     data bykeeping it localto each phone.Emotient attempts to read facial expressions in order to     determine a person's emotional state. This recent acquisition     is likely related to apatent Apple applied forin 2014, describing a system for determining mood based on     numerous factors, including facial expressions.Tuplejump provided a better way to apply deep learning to     large data sets as they are uploaded. Apple has previously     stated that it could receive filtered data from iPhones, and     this technology would enable it to process the data in real     time.One especially compelling acquisition was Turi, described as a   ""machine learning platform for developers and data scientists.""   It had created tools that allowed developers to build apps   utilizing deep learning that could scale for many users; this   tool kit was described as being similar to Google's TensorFlow   open-source machine-learning library. Turi allows Apple to bring   AI capabilities to developers for its App Store offerings.Twitter wants a seat at the big tech tableTwitter acquired Whetlab to boost AI efforts. Image source:     Whetlab.Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) has made a number of AI-related acquisitions in the area of   machine learning. Each appears to provide the company with   specific opportunities to improve its current business:Madbits focused on technology related to searching and     understanding images, and the ability to organize large data     sets. It previously released an iOS app that created photo     collages.Magic Pony developed neural networks that can sharpen     blurry cellphone images or video to near HD-quality. It also     can use information in the original to improvise new or     expanded images -- great for use in virtual reality. These will     both help Twitter increase its image features.TellApart allows marketers to better target potential     customers across device platforms. This could improve     monetization of Twitter's ads.Whetlab is probably the most interesting acquisition. While it   is less business-specific, it will bring the most advanced AI   capability. It created technology that helps companies jump-start   their deep learning by providing an infrastructure; the time   required to train AI systems is reduced from months to days. This   technology can be used to improve a variety of areas in Twitter's   business, including language understanding, image recognition,   and user profiles.These acquisitions reveal how two very different technology   companies are integrating AI with a goal of improving their   respective businesses. Acquisitions for their own sake are folly,   but using them to gain a competitive advantage, improve business   processes, or to better serve customers can lead to success. Time   will tell how successful each of these companies has been in   leveraging these technologies.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Apple (AAPL) On Track to ""Make in India"" by April 2017?";2/3/2017;"Reportedly,AppleAAPLwill set up its iPhone assembly line in India by the end of Apr 2017. The iPhone-maker will set up its first manufacturing unit in Bangalore, Karnataka and has teamed up with Wistron Corp. from Taiwan to take care of the assembly of the iPhones.Why India?The decision comes at a time when the smartphone market is witnessing a slowdown in other parts of the world except India, which remains the fastest growing market in the segment.With Narendra Modi at the helm, the tagline of ""Make in India"" is fast catching up with global manufacturing majors. The Apple deal could open the doors for other global players to set up their manufacturing units in the country.However, China still remains a major contender in the manufacturing space.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteWhat Does This Mean for Apple?Currently, the smartphone scene in India is being dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. and other comparatively cheap Chinese brands such as Oppo.As per a Counterpoint Research report, in 2016, Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India. However, the company ranked 10thin the top smartphone vendors list for the December quarter. An estimated 750 million smartphones are projected to be sold in the country by 2020, where Apple currently has only a 2% market share.As per capita income in the country is on the rise, this trend is likely to witness a major shift with people turning to premium-priced phones such as the iPhone in the future.Moreover, Apple's strategy to remain a fabless firm by handing over capital intensive processes such as manufacturing, factory building and staff hiring to third parties (in this case Wistron Corp.) are expected to positively impact the company's bottom-line going ahead.Stock Performance OverviewShares of Apple have performed more or less in line with the broader ZacksComputer - Mini Computersindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 33.1%, the stock gained 32.7%The in-line performance of the stock could be primarily attributed to good growth in its services revenues, especially with regard to Apple Music and App Store.

Also, intensifying competition and macroeconomic headwinds remain concerns for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space include Acxiom CorporationACXM, Aspen Technology, Inc.AZPNand Inphi CorporationIPHI, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Apple, Intel, Exxon Beat; Merck, Pfizer, Chevron Miss on Revenues";2/3/2017;"The Dow suffered losses over the week as optimism over Trump's election gave way to apprehension over his actions as President. Newly introduced immigration rules led to protests, criticism and legal challenges. Additionally, the tech sector expressed concerns over the impact these regulations would have on their businesses. Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy also led to widespread heartburn and dampened investor sentiment.Last Week's PerformanceThe Dow lost a meager 0.04% last Friday after fourth quarter GDP fell short of estimates.  U.S economy slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter after plunge in shipments of soyabeans adversely affected exports. Annual growth failed to reach 3% for the 11th straight year, indicating the hurdles Trump administration faces to speed up expansion. Orders for long-lasting goods, meantime, dropped 0.4% in December for the second month in a row.The index gained 1.3% over last week. Trump's growth-focused actions led the benchmarks to close in positive territory. His moves to revive two major oil pipeline projects, signing executive orders to improve border security and control immigration raised speculation that he will proceed with tax cuts, financial deregulation and introduce expansionary infrastructure spending.The DowThisWeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday as investors' grappled over President Trump's order to tighten immigration rules. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Such an executive order spawned legal challenges, congressional criticism and widespread protests. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore good for stocks.The Dow logged its worst daily loss since mid-October on Monday, while a popular measure of Wall Street fear climbed to its highest level in about three months.Consumer spending increased 0.5% in December, matching the consensus estimate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The index declined 0.5% on Tuesday amid signs that momentum following President Donald Trump's election victory in November was fading. His signing of an executive order to temporary restrict immigration saw weekend chaos and backlash, eventually affecting stocks. Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years.Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013. The Dow added 0.5% for the month of January. Projections for stronger economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings boosted US stocks for the first January rise in five years. Stocks rallied on hopes that the new administration's policies including lowering of taxes and cutting regulations will bolster economic growth.The materials sector has fueled the rally, advancing 5.1% so far this year, following a 14% gain in 2016. Technology shares that trailed behind the broader market last year have also recorded sharp gains this year. The sector has risen 3.6% in January, its best month since last July. Earnings in the final quarter of 2016 came on the heels of growth in the third quarter that snapped a 15-month decline in earnings.The index gained 0.1% on Wednesday after Apple Inc.AAPL, the largest U.S. company by market cap, reported upbeat earnings. Meanwhile, the Fed ended its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and revealed that measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. But the Fed kept rates unchanged within a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't give any sign that it would raise rates in its next meeting in March, putting the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group. The ISM manufacturing index climbed to 56% last month from 54.5% in December, marking the fifth straight gain and also its highest level since end 2014.The index declined a meagre 0.03% on Thursday after President Donald Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy dented investor sentiment. Investors grappled over Trump's executive order to tighten immigration rules, while the White House warned Iran that the country could face new sanctions over a recent ballistic missile test. Trump also labelled a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a ""dumb deal"" and reiterated concerns about trade ties with Mexico.ComponentsMovingthe IndexApple's first quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion.

3 Interesting Things We Learned From Snapchat's IPO Prospectus;2/3/2017;"Snap Inc., the parent company of photo-sharing application Snapchat, recently filed a prospectus with the SEC and is officially gearing up for an initial public offering. Snapchat has taken the social media landscape by storm since its debut in 2012, and with private valuations hitting nearly $25 billion, investors should be anticipating what could be the biggest tech IPO of the year.Snapchat co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel, alongside fellow founder and CTO Bobby Murphy, will lead his company through this important period. At just 26 and 28 years of age, Spiegel and Murphy are set to become some of the wealthiest under-30s in the world after Snap Inc. debuts; just how much their net worths will swell depends on how big the company's IPO can get, and we got a better sense of this size from its recent prospectus filing.(Also Read:Inside Snapchat: The Best Tech IPO of 2017?)The prospectus contained tons of juicy information, including key financial and membership data. For example, we learned that Snapchat now has about 158 million average daily active users and its annual revenue swelled to $404.4 million in 2016. We also know that Snapchat plans to list its shares in March under the ticker ""SNAP."" The company filed for $3 billion debut, but this is expected to be a placeholder until Snap Inc. prices the deal.All of this information is important to know and understand as investors think about investing in Snapchat at its IPO. However, the juiciest details in the prospectus were ones that not every investor expected to see or knew to look for. Check out these three key facts that you may have missed:1.It's a ""camera company"" … kind ofWhile most people would consider Snapchat a social media company, its prospectus proudly proclaimed that ""Snap Inc. is a camera company."" In the sense that Snapchat is inherently interested in its users' phone cameras, this is a logical statement; however, Snapchat is certainly not-nor does it seem interested in becoming-a major manufacturer of camera-based hardware.Sure, the company recently debuted its own line of camera-equipped sunglasses called ""Spectacles,"" but as its prospectus points out, 96% of revenue comes from advertising and that is unlikely to change soon. Do you know any other ""camera companies"" that rely on advertising revenue? Not really, which means Snapchat's labeling of itself as a ""camera company"" is more about its focus on the importance of the camera as a communicative device, not its business model.2.Mysterious third founder is goneThose who have followed Snapchat since its earliest days are probably already familiar with the impressive leadership of Spiegel and Murphy. However, every Snapchat-related story seems to include a mention of Reggie Brown, Snapchat's mysterious third founder who reportedly came up with the idea of disappearing photos.While we knew that Brown was no longer at the company, the prospectus finally revealed the full details on the situation, and it is a classic case of ""hush money"" that resembles the Winklevoss-Zuckerberg fiasco. According to the filing, Brown sued the company over intellectual property violations in February 2013. The parties involved eventually settled in September 2014, with Snap Inc. agreeing to pay Brown about $158 million in cash.3.They know their competitionOne of the key elements of a prospectus for a company like Snap Inc. is the information the company shares about its perceived challenges within its own industry. In that regard, it is clear that Snapchat is acutely aware of its competitors right now.The company underscores the dangers of competitors that ""mimic"" Snapchat's features throughout the report, and it uses a rhetoric of caution to describe the businesses that challenge it.""Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader global recognition and occupy better competitive positions in certain markets than we do,"" the prospectus said, identifying FacebookFB, AppleAAPL, Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, LINELN, Twitter (TWTR), and many others as key foes.Final DetailsStartups like Snapchat benefit greatly from keeping their books closed and operating under the cover of being private, but the era is nearly over for Snap Inc., and the company will soon have many new shareholders to please.Looking ahead, we can expect a SNAP offering in March, and pricing details should come closer to that time. Other than that, we know that SNAP will be listed on the NYSE and some of the world's biggest banks, including Morgan StanleyMS, Goldman SachsGS, JPMorganJPM, Deutsche BankDB, BarclaysBCS, and Credit SuisseCS, are working on the deal.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking   About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapses;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's often stated by motivational speakers that the Chinese word for ""crisis"" is composed of two characters - one signifying danger, the other opportunity. It's alsoembarrassingly inaccurate. This goes to show you that if the crux of an investment argument invokes ""the Chinese,"" stop! You might be getting had. Still, this ""Chinese philosophy"" is extremely relevant for tech stocks these days.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's because semiconductor and digital communications giantQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is having a year to forget. Despite the fact that it's only early February, QCOM shares are down 18.5% year-to-date. Not surprisingly, Qualcomm is trading firmly below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. If something substantive doesn't happen soon, it risks repeating the disaster of 2015, when QCOM lost nearly 31%.The disaster that Qualcomm is currently facing was seen well in advance by those watching the industry closely. The crux of the issue is the company's technology licensing business. This is themost lucrativedivision for QCOM, accounting for the majority of its profits. By ""selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems,"" QCOM had a monopoly. That's an incredible opportunity, so long as you don't get caught.Of course, they got caught. First, it was, you guessed it - the Chinese. Regulators in the world's second-biggest economy found Qualcomm guilty of violating theiranti-monopoly law. Then, individual companies began filing complaints. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission got involved in mid-January, claiming that QCOM illegally maintained a monopoly. Shares never looked the same after that, and who knows when Qualcomm will recover.Those are questions that analysts will squabble over. But for rival tech stocks, they only have one message - better you than me. It's not just the fact that a major competitor is falling. This is a classic case where an enemy of an enemy is a friend. Furthermore, the benchmarkTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK) is up 4.6% YTD. Granted, these aren't the best numbers, but it's much more preferable than what Qualcomm is going through.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryWhile QCOM is swimming with the sharks, here are three tech stocks that are now set up to win big!Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Apple Inc. (AAPL)Click to EnlargeUndoubtedly, of all the tech stocks that were affected by Qualcomm,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands to be the biggest winner.On Jan. 20, AAPL filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging that the company ""withheld $1 billion in rebates in retaliation for Apple cooperating with Korean efforts to open the radio chip market."" Although it's difficult to call a stalwart like AAPL a ""victim,"" the pattern of allegations is pretty damning.First, we already saw Qualcomm violate foreign anti-competition laws, and pay dearly for it. Second, Korean manufacturerSamsung Electronics Co. Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) alleged similar shenanigans, although they later backed down. Finally, and most importantly, the FTC claimed that Qualcomm forced AAPL to use their chips to prevent competitor encroachment. For Qualcomm, Applr is its biggest customer, so the potential ramifications are deep and wide.Of course, Cupertino isn't going to shed any tears.Last October, AAPL ""reported its first decline in annual sales and profit in 15 years,"" according toThe Guardian. There are serious concerns that the king of consumer tech stocks has reached peak popularity. Whatever it is, Apple needs to boost its profitability. Getting out of unfavorable contracts is a good start.And with the world seemingly against Qualcomm, AAPL has an excellent chance of reviving itself at their expense.Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Intel Corporation (INTC)Click to EnlargeAlthough I believe that Apple will get the most benefit out of the QCOM fiasco,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) has a strong case as well. I wouldn't be surprised if most people viewed it as a toss-up between the two titans.Among tech stocks, INTC is one of the most recognizable, but for the wrong reasons. Everybody knows the ""Intel Inside"" slogan, but the only problem is that it relates to the aging personal computer business.It's a common challenge for consumer tech stocks - INTC needs to find new blood. The company'srevenue growthisn't the most consistent in the world. That's why the partnership last year between Intel and AAPL was a much-needed step in the right direction. Up until that point, Qualcomm was the sole provider of chips for the iPhone.In 2016, INTC stepped in to provide half the demand. Apparently, QCOM took exception to this arrangement; hence, the FTC charges of competitive foul play.So far, the market response towards Intel stock has been mixed. Therefore, I still give the advantage to Apple. Nevertheless, encouraging signs do exist. Yes, shares are down 4% from its high of the year. However, it's still very close to parity for the year. Furthermore, INTC remains inside a bullish trend channel that began in late summer of 2015.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketThe collapse at Qualcomm just gives other tech stocks more options, and Intel is happy to help.Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Broadcom Ltd (AVGO)Click to EnlargeWhile virtually all tech stocks are affected by the Qualcomm crisis, few were as glued to their TV screens asBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO).As a semiconductor and communications company themselves, AVGO is a direct competitor and rival to QCOM.Naturally, if your primary nemesis goes down hard, it raises the boat for everyone else. And Qualcomm is sinking quite nicely for the Singapore-based firm.It's not just the fact that QCOM has transitioned into the world's most hated stock. Nor is it the money that they'll have to dish out in penalties. Rather, Qualcomm will be forced to fundamentally change its business plan. If it doesn't, government watchdogs are on standby, eager to pounce. That just gives AVGO and others a leg up. Maybe Broadcom is no saint. However, at the moment, the spotlight isn't on it, providing a margin of comfort.Most importantly, AVGO is making the most of its ""Chinese crisis."" On a YTD basis, shares are up a smoking 16% - that's almost the exact inverse of Qualcomm's results. Furthermore, Broadcom is trending inside a steadily rising channel. With so much ugliness associated with its primary rival, it's hard not to see anything but optimism for AVGO.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapsesappeared first onInvestorPlace."

If You Like Apple Inc., You’ll Love Skyworks Solutions Inc (AAPL, SWKS);2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSuccessful stock market investing over the long term takes skills in several disciplines. First, you need to be able to think outside of the box by looking behind the headline stocks into lesser-known names operating behind the scenes.makeArticleAd();Now, I am certainly not saying to avoid the headline names. Getting in early on a favorite stock is a sure way to stock market profits. But often, once a stock starts making mainstream news headlines it's upward price momentum is about to slow or fail altogether.Identifying companies that support one or a combination of headline names yet do not get the same attention as the headliner is a consistent way to locate winning stocks for the long term.Once you locate your behind-the-news stock, it's time to take a close look at its fundamentals to make certain there is support behind the price move. Are the fundamentals improving over time? Are revenue and sales upward-trending from quarter to quarter? Do the products and services support an overall societal or economic trend? These are the basic questions to answer before making an investing decision.Next, make certain the share price is in an overall upward trend. This means judging whether the shares higher over the last year and by how much they are up relative to the headline name.Ideally, the stock should be outpacing the headliner price-performance wise and consistently making new highs on the daily price chart.I like stocks that are trading at or near their highs for one of my favorite investing tactics, trend following.I define trend following as buying stocks as they make new highs, then riding the upward trend and protecting profits via trailing stops. Certainly, there are many permutations of this basic method, such as waiting for a short term pullback to enter long, but for the purpose of this article, buying breakouts to new highs will suffice.The ideal trend-following stock isSkyworks Solutions Inc(SWKS).

How Options Traders Nailed Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Earnings;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a market known for its power of perfect pricing, nowhere is that more obvious than inAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). But if you're looking for answers from AMZN stock, that's only one-half of this puzzling confirmation.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonIf you're an Amazon shareholder, Friday's early morning low of $801 - off more than 4% - wasn't exactly money in the bank. AMZN stock is on the defensive followinglast night's earnings release, which put investors into profit-taking mode.AMZN Stock by the NumbersAmazon reported better-than-expected profits of $1.54, beating the Street view by 17 cents. Sales, on the other hand, were short of estimates, at $43.7 billion versus a $44.68 billion bar. For the full year, though, profits quadrupled on a 27% increase in revenues.The company's operating income outlook has possibly raised some hairs on the backs of AMZN bulls. A forecast of $250 million to $900 million falls well below the Street's consensus of $1.33 billion. But it's not as bad as it looks, as most of the ""warning"" is tied to aggressive investments in media, fulfillment and India.As well, while investors are failing to rejoice Friday, Amazon also delivered the goods with its operating cash flow, which jumped by 38% to $16.4 billion.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketWhat's more, revenues of $3.54 billion from its coveted Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit climbed an impressive 47% over last year's same-quarter result of $2.41 billion, while contributing 9% to Amazon's net revenues for the year.By the ""Other"" Numbers …That said, Amazon's report hasn't been nearly as punishing from the standpoint of professional options traders.Based on last night's 03 Feb $840 straddle market, pricing of $42 for the non-directional spread with AMZN stock at $840 amounted to traders putting the over/under bet at 5% or estimated range from $798 to $882. This weekly contract, which expires today, is the purest play on the earnings event and collectively tells us what traders expect for Amazon shares in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.Further, as most often it's the professional options traders and market makers that sell options premiums, the basic assumption is this more informed and disciplined group is collectively wagering on the ""under"" side of the 5% in AMZN stock.So far, not only has Friday's low of $801 in Amazon shares fallen within the forecast by options traders, but relative to past earnings events of the last few years, call and put premiums were decidedly below average.Thehistorical recordshows that over the past five years, the average up or down move in Amazon stock has been 8.4%, with a median reaction of 8.1%. Fine-tuning the price activity down to the last five quarters, AMZN's average move has been slightly higher at 9%, but a modestly lower median of 7.7%.AMZN Stock Daily ChartClick to EnlargeFinally, Friday's conditions in Amazon shares may not have been as fierce as we've been led to believe.Take a look at the accompanying chart. Ifcharts don't lie, then AMZN stockclearlywas a double-top pattern.I'm being facetious, of course. But even if I wasn't, I'd always look to hedge my directional bet with options and money management opportunities in case I read a chart like Amazon's with less-than-perfect forecasting.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock: 2 Reasons to Steer Clear;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings beat in which the company reported $1.1 billion in revenue. AMD stock bounced 16% to above the $12 level as a result, continuing a red-hot streak of nearly 500% returns in just 52 weeks.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrThis was a sub-$2 stockjust a year agoamid fears about competition and potential bankruptcy.AMD is a leading maker of graphics cards, including Radeon for consumers and FirePro for workstations. The company operates in two segments: Computing and Graphics, which makes desktop and notebook processors and professional graphics; andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom, producing server chips, embedded processors for the Internet of Things and chips for gaming consoles.Since taking the helm two years ago, Advanced Micro Devices CEOLisa Su-  an MIT-educated electrical engineer who has authored over 40 technical papers - has presided over a remarkable recovery. Now, AMD, having played second fiddle toIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) for decades, ismaking a playfor the PC and server markets, Intel's bread and butter. AMD's Ryzen CPU will challenge Intel's Core i5 and i7 chips.AMD is moving up the value chain amid a falling PC market, going from low-end to high-end PC processors .Even if prospects for Advanced Micro Devices' business are good, though, investors have to deal with a few issues. AMD hasn't posted an operating profit since the third quarter of 2014, holds a great deal of debt and yet trades at a stratospheric valuation.Amid these high expectations and gains worthy of bubble talk, is AMD stock still a buy? Here are two problems that should have the bulls taking a second look.AMD Has a Not-Great Balance SheetDespite many chipmakers such as AMD going ""fabless"" and outsourcing the fabrication of their chips to contract manufacturers such asTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM), the industry remains capital-intensive.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketAdvanced Micro Devices escaped bankruptcy last year. It took advantage of low interest rates and improved investor confidence to restructure its debt in September 2016. AMD issued$600 million in sharesand $450 million in convertible senior notes. This enabled AMD to pay off $676 million in debt due in 2020. So instead of $600 million in AMD debt maturing in 2019, only $196 million will mature that year.Still, AMD is highly leveraged by several measures. With $1.435 billion in long-term debt and $416 million in shareholder equity as of Dec. 31, 2016, AMD's long-term debt-to-equity ratio stands at 3.44. That figure is much lower for Intel, at 0.38, andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), at 0.37, indicating less leverage. Likewise, AMD's debt-to-capital ratio of 0.775 stands above 0.27 for both INTC and NVDA.Intel and Nvidia also are better able to service debt. For the year ended December 31, 2016, AMD generated only $90 million in operating cash flow, with $2.9 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.031.NVDA earned $1.462 billion in operating cash flow for the four quarters ended October 30, 2016, with $4.24 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.34.Intel showed an even healthier balance sheet, with $19.09 billion in operating cash flow for $48 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.396.AMD Stock Is Much More ExpensiveNvidia and Intel are profitable and have a better track record of generating operating cash flow. They earned positive operating cash flow in the four most recent quarters, while AMD's operating cash flow went negative for two quarters.Still, AMD stock trades at a huge premium to both.AMD trades at a whopping 25.66 times book, versus 11.5 for Nvidia (which itself is high), and 2.61 for Intel. It's not difficult to justify a higher price than Intel given AMD's growth prospects, but for comparison's sake, know that while Wall Street sees Advanced Micro Devices growing revenues roughly 10% this year and next, NVDA should be sitting at roughly 37% annual sales growth after it reports Q4 earnings, with analysts expecting that to slow to ""only"" 16% next year.ConclusionIt's difficult to fight the momentum, but you might just want to in AMD stock. At this point, anyone tussling with Advanced Micro Devices is playing with overpriced fire.Should You Buy FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsFrom a valuation standpoint, INTC actually looks like the best buy, simply because the market expects less from it than from AMD and NVDA. Also, Intel leads in the production of microprocessors, and this matters in the semiconductor industry, since often only the market leaders can turn a profit, while laggards destroy value.AMD made some mistakes in the past, switching back and forth between ARM and x86 architectures, and never was quite able to catch up to Intel. The stock looks promising, but dislodging Intel and showing a steady track record of profits will not be easy in this industry.As of this writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Going to BounceApple Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Smartwatch Is Still Dominant Despite All the Doubt;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook went on the attack against claims Apple Watch sales were in the dumpster his comments about record holiday sales were taken with a healthy dose of skepticism.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleAfter all, it was his job to talk up his company's products. Even a similar claim in Apple's Q1 earnings report seemed questionable, with no detail provided. However, a report on global smartwatch shipments for Q4 2016 supports AAPL's claims.The numbers say Apple Watch sales did indeed set a holiday record and took an even larger share of overall smartwatch sales that quarter than in the 2015 holidays.Defending Apple Watch SalesTim Cook had his work cut out for him after AAPL launched the Apple Watch Series 2 in September. Apple was counting on the new model to boost sales going into the holiday quarter of a year where consumer interest in smartwatches was slipping.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) opted to skip its expected Android Wear 2 smartwatch operating system upgrade.Pebble, the early smartwatch pioneer, would soon collapse and have its assets bought up byFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).When research firm IDC released a report in December saying Apple Watch sales had tanked, dropping 71% from the previous year, Cook went on the offensive.In an e-mailtoReuters, he wrote:""Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.""The problem was, with a new model just launched and the crucial holiday shopping season ramping up, everyone was expecting AAPL to put a positive spin on Apple Watch sales. And without numbers to back it up, Cook's statement wasn't necessarily taken at face value.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaEven Apple's Q1 earnings report, where the Apple Watch was noted to have set an ""all-time revenue record"" didn't convince everyone. AAPL didn't spike out any actual number to back that up and the Other division that includes the Apple Watch saw its revenue drop 8% year-over-year.AAPL Wasn't Blowing Smoke About Apple Watch SalesResearch firm Strategy Analytics released itsreport on global smartwatch shipments for Q4, 2016(the period corresponding to AAPL's Q1 2017). In it, global smartwatch sales are shown to have recovered from a slow first half, to mark a 1% increase over 2015. As for the Apple Watch?""Demand for Apple's new Watch Series 2 as a holiday-season gift in Western markets was surprisingly strong and it enabled Apple to clear a large backlog of smartwatch inventory during the quarter.""According to Strategy Analytics, that translated to a record 5.2 million Apple Watch sales in the fourth quarter, up from 5.1 million the previous year. In addition, while AAPL lost ground in the overall smartwatch market in 2016 - dropping to a 55% share compared to over 65% in 2015 by selling 2 million fewer smartwatches on the year - during the holiday quarter, the company captured over 63% of all smartwatch sales.Where Does This Leave AAPL and the Apple Watch?Apple is still the dominant smartwatch maker, and the Apple Watch Series 2 showed the company isn't sitting still. Its overall market share dropped to 55%, but it remains firmly on top.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Second placeSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) took a big hit over the holiday quarter, despite releasing a new model of its own, the Gear S3. Samsung's holiday quarter marketshare dropped from 16% to 9.8%, while its overall marketshare for 2016 dropped from 13% to 11.4%. A collection of other manufacturers from Fitbit toLGtook over one third of the market in 2016 (up from 21.6%) showing the increasing diversification of smartwatch sales.The smartwatch market still isn't setting the world on fire, but despite a slow 2016, any reports of its death are greatly exaggerated. And while AAPL is sharing the market with an increasingly diverse group of competitors, Apple Watch sales have not cratered. They were down overall for the year, but Apple maintained a dominant position and the new Apple Watch Series 2 did indeed propel the company to record smartwatch sales over the holidays.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfThe postApple Inc.

GoPro (GPRO) Q4 Results Mixed with Earnings Beat & View Cut;2/3/2017;"After four back-to-back quarters of posting quarterly losses,GoPro, Inc.GPROmanaged to get back in the green as it posted adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share in its fourth-quarter 2016 results. The action camera maker's bottom-line figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents by an impressive 33%.However, the earnings figure was a result of several adjustments made to the huge GAAP loss that GoPro reported (82 cents per share).Shares tumbled almost 14% at one point in late trading in the aftermath of the results, as investors were disillusioned with the company's bleak sales outlook for first-quarter 2017. This was in spite of the fact that this was the second biggest quarter in terms of revenue in GoPro's history. The drab guidance must have spooked investors as 2017 was supposed to be a turnaround time for GoPro and this is a terrible start to the same.In addition, investors were likely upset with the multiple missed opportunities and goof-ups that GoPro had this quarter.The huge GAAP loss of 82 cents for the quarter was much wider than the 25 cents loss generated in the comparable quarter last year.For full-year 2016, the company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $1.44 per share, in stark contrast to net income of 76 cents in 2015.Inside the HeadlinesGoPro's revenues grew 23.8% from the prior-year quarter's tally to $540.6 million. This marked the company's return to revenue growth after four successive quarters of sales declines. The top-line figure still lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $576 million.This was the first quarter that reflected the performance of the recently launched Hero5 camera and its consumer drone Karma, and revenues were far short of the company's earlier guidance of $625 million. The Karma recall hit the top line and manufacturing issues related to Hero5 camera also strained growth.Nevertheless, Hero5 Black was the best-selling digital imaging device in units and dollars in the U.S. and Europe. Also, Hero5 Black sold more units in a single quarter in Europe, in this quarter, than any other GoPro camera ever.For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margins expanded 990 bps year over year to 39.5%. Non-GAAP operating income came in at $31.6 million, as against an operating loss of $21.6 million generated last year.R&D expenses were up almost 40% year over year, driven by investment in HERO5 cameras, Karma, accessories and software. In addition, sales and marketing expenses shot up 36% year over year.The company recently launched GoPro Plus - a cloud-based subscription service - that enables auto-upload of footage from a GoPro camera to a GoPro Plus cloud account for on-the-go access, editing and sharing using a smartphone and the Quik app. Even though it is early days, the GoPro Plus is enjoying high retention rates in the U.S. and its subscriber base seems to be expanding.In the quarter, the rebranded Quik mobile app was downloaded over 4 million times (up almost 30% sequentially), as its active users and monthly exports tripled in Dec 2016 over the prior year.For full-year 2016, revenues plunged 26.8% year over year to $1.62 billion.Notable DevelopmentsTill date, GoPro's Hero 5 Black cameras and Karma drones have faced production issues and delayed shipments, which restrained the company's ability to meet demand in the quarter. The company's new products also had a rocky start with Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, as GoPro had temporarily stopped selling them on the e-commerce site in mid October due to a pricing dispute.Further, supply constraints made retailers cancel marketing support of GoPro's new products, particularly its new Hero 5 camera, which obviously hurt revenues. Further, the company had to announce a recall of its new Karma drone after a mere fortnight of its commercial launch, as a few of them lost power during flight due to battery issues. This was also a huge setback for the company.However, earlier this week, the company resumed Karma sales and the company plans to ramp production further. Karma is scheduled to be available in international markets this spring. We believe that GoPro is well set to capitalize on the fast-growing consumer drone market.The company also launched several accessories during the quarter, including Karma Grip, a handheld stabilizer; Remo, a waterproof, voice-activated remote and Quik Key, a microSD card reader enabling quick editing and sharing from smartphones.LiquidityExiting the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $192.1 million, down significantly from $280 million a year back.GuidanceIn light of such unfortunate events and uncertain market reaction, the company gave a very disappointing guidance for first-quarter 2017. It projects revenues for the current quarter in the range of $190-$210 million, which is well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $268 million for the quarter. The company expects gross margin in the low 30% range.GoPro refrained from offering specific revenue or margin guidance for full-year 2017.However, GoPro declared plans to limit its adjusted operating expenses in 2017 to $600 million, in an attempt to try to return to full-year profitability next year. This is comparable to a 2016 figure of about $709 million.GoPro should be able to attain these massive cost reductions, in light of its recent business restructuring, which did away with many high-cost operations including its entertainment division.It is likely that GoPro's sales will gradually improve as it ramps production and expands Karma's reach to international markets. This will supplement its cost-reduction initiatives and enable it to achieve sustained, profitable growth.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|GoPro, Inc. QuoteOur TakeIn recent months, the company has been grappling to achieve its earlier growth and go beyond its trademark action cameras. GoPro had earlier reduced its inventory of older legacy cameras, in order to prepare for its new products. However, what followed was more operational stumbles and messed-up products launches.The company has also been facing pressure to establish a more mainstream market for its cameras. However, tough competition from smartphone brands such as Apple Inc.AAPLand Samsung Electronics Corp. has been making it difficult for the company.Despite all the problems that GoPro is straining under, the company is confident of strong demand trajectory for its latest products and is expecting to return to double-digit growth in 2017.However big the issues it faces, GoPro still boasts an enviable retail presence. Extremely few consumer technology companies have the kind of retail presence that GoPro has and this might work in favour of the company. Whether this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock can successfully build a market for its new products and return to sustainable growth, remains to be seen.A better-ranked stock in the Zacks categorizedAudio/Video Home Productsindustry is Dolby Laboratories, Inc.DLB.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Moved Too Far, Too Fast;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedearnings Tuesdayof $3.38 per share on revenues of $78.35 billion. Both of these metrics were significant beats as consensus expectations were $3.22 EPS and $76.2 billion in sales. Apple stock initially shot up nearly 9 points, or 7.5%, post earnings and briefly traded above the critical $130 before pulling back.makeArticleAd();Source:via AppleWhile the earnings report certainly was solid, the reaction of AAPL stock was a case of too far, too fast. I look for Apple stock to continue to have difficulties moving appreciably higher over the coming months.As mentioned, AAPL reported a stellar quarter. While revenues beat tempered analysts expectations, the actual revenues rose by only 5% year over year. Important to add that this quarter had an extra weekend in the reporting period, meaning overall revenue growth was rather stagnant.With any company, but especially the largest U.S. market cap company such as AAPL, the law of large numbers certainly begins to apply when projecting future growth. With Apple now trading at the highest price/sales ratio (and the first time over 3) in the past year, investors are paying a hefty comparative price for AAPL stock.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryA P/E comparative paints a similar picture, with AAPL stock now trading above a 15 multiple.Technically, AAPL stock definitely looks toppy at the $130 level. After a stunning 20% rise from the Nov. 14 lows of $105.71, Apple stock encountered some significant resistance at the $130 level. This was a major area of resistance back in the first half of 2015 as well.Apple is also extremely overbought, with a 14 day RSI well over 80. Previous instances when AAPL was this overbought proved to be significant short-term tops in Apple stock. Yesterday's price action, with the stock trading higher only to reverse and close lower on the day, also points to exhaustion in the rally.While I am not looking for a dramatic pullback in AAPL stock, I also think the rally has gotten more than a little ahead of itself. A period of sideways consolidative price action is likely in store.One of the benefits of options is that you can structure a trade to make, as Dire Straits famously said, money for nothing. So to position for AAPL to struggle to head higher over the next month, a short-term bear call spread makes intuitive sense.AAPL Stock Trade IdeaBuy May $145 calls and sell May $140 calls for a 60-cent net credit or better.Trade of the Day: AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) Stock Looks Like a BargainMaximum gain on the trade is $60 per spread with maximum risk of $440 per spread. Return on risk is 13.63%. The short $140 strike price is nearly 9% above the Thursday closing price of $128.53 and also well above the $130 resistance level.I would close out the trade on a significant move to new all-time highs on AAPL while looking to let the spread expire worthless and keep the initial $60 premium if AAPL remains well behaved.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Be a Step Closer to Booting Intel From Macs;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's an idea that has been around for several years now: replace theIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) chips currently powering Mac computers with ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH). Doing so would have many advantages forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). According to aBloombergreport, the prospect of ARM CPUs in Macs is getting closer, with AAPL working on a new chip that would independently control a MacBook's low power mode.makeArticleAd();Source: ARM HoldingsWhether you think it's a great idea or a head scratcher, theTouch Baris the tentpole feature of Apple's new MacBook Pro. The Touch Bar is an OLED strip that replaces the laptop's function keys with a programmable touch display, with virtual buttons based on the application currently being run. It also incorporates a fingerprint reader.And the Touch Bar is powered by the T1, Apple's first ARM-based Mac chip.New ARM CPUs in Macs?Bloombergis now reporting thatAAPL engineers are taking the next step toward ARM in Mac, by having the ""Power Nap"" mode controlled by an ARM chip. Power Nap is a feature that lets Mac laptops run basic background functions such as retrieving e-mail and installing software updates, while closed and sleeping. By shifting control of Power Nap from the Intel CPU to an ARM chip, less power is used and MacBook battery would last longer.Why the excitement about the possibility of Apple making a complete switch and replacing Intel processors with ARM CPUs in Macs?ARM in Mac: The PayoffsThere are many compelling reasons, includingthose laid out last yearby theMacObserver. ARM chips power all of Apple's mobile devices, so switching to ARM CPUs in Macs would simplify and unify code development between MacOS and iOS.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaIntel has moved away from tick-tock processor development cycles, so it may not be moving forward fast enough for Apple's needs. Modern, 64-bit ARM processors are becoming competitive with Intel on power, including the power needed to run an operating system like Windows in a virtual environment; therefore, ARM in Mac wouldn't have to mean Macs lose the option to runMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows.Then there's cost. In a post dating back to 2015AppleInsiderbroke down thepotential financial gain should Apple ditch Intel. It estimated the cost of the A-series chips used in the iPhone and iPad at roughly $25, while Intel CPUs used in Macs were somewhere in the $180 to $300 range.The site points to the Apple TV as an example of Apple making the switch. The first generation ran a version of OS X on Intel processors. For the second generation, AAPL switched to an ARM-based A4 chip running iOS. That move shrunk the Apple TV size and knocked the price from $299 to $99. The numbers may have changed a little since then, but the same basic math applies: ARM is considerably cheaper.Will Apple Ditch Intel?There would be many risks in switching to ARM CPUs in Macs. Even if AAPL did make that decision, it would still need Intel CPUs for a number of years while it made the transition across the Mac product line - and Intel would be able to stick it to Apple for those chips. There would be challenges around integrating ARM chips with high-end graphics cards like those made byNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Other third-party hardware would also require work.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!There is also the issue of manufacturing capacity: AAPL's suppliers would need to be able to pick up the slack from Intel and churn out the needed ARM chips.However, as intense as all this sounds, it's worth remembering that AAPL has done it all before. Twice! The company transitioned the entire Mac platform from 68k to PowerPC in 1998, and then from PowerPC to Intel in 2005.ARM CPUs in Macs aren't a reality yet, but with the new ARM chips rumored for MacBooks, it seems as though AAPL is testing the waters. With Nvidia already causing it grief byturning its video cards into high-powered CPU-bustersand Microsoft once again trying for a version ofWindows on ARM processors, Intel has to be watching the ARM in Mac situation with more than a little consternation.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfApple Inc.

Apple Inc's iPad Business Isn't as Bad as It Looks;2/3/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) reported a strong quarter, driven by   better-than-expected demand in its key product line, the iPhone.   However, while investors often pay far more attention to the   iPhone business than to any of the company's other segments, it's   important to watch the others nonetheless.Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();That includes the iPad business.Apple reported a 19% year-over-year drop in iPad unit   shipments and a full 22% year-over-year drop in iPad revenue,   making it the company's worst-performing business unit by far.   Although these results are quite disappointing -- making it   increasingly difficult to have confidence in the future of this   product line -- the business isn't in as dire shape as it   appears.Channel inventory dynamicsIn Apple's most recent quarter, it shipped 13.08 million   iPads, down from 16.12 million in the same period a year ago. One   of the drivers of the steep year-over-year drop was channel   inventory dynamics. Remember that Apple ships products to   distributors (i.e., channel partners), and then those   distributors sell those products to end customers. To get a   true sense of underlying customer demand, it's important to not   just watch the change in unit shipments but the amount of   inventory that's sitting out there in the hands of Apple's   channel partners.With that in mind, Apple says that in the most recent quarter,   the companyreducediPad channel inventories by 700,000 units. The company says that   in the year-ago quarter, Apple hadboostedits channel inventory levels by 900,000 units.So to get a sense of the underlying demand, we can adjust the   numbers to account for the channel inventory changes. Apple   shipped 13.08 iPads, but channel inventories were down 700,000   units, which suggests that actual demand was more like 13.78   million units. Performing the same math for the year-ago   quarter, Apple increased channel inventory by 900,000 units,   meaning that underlying customer demand was 15.22 million   units.To be clear, demand wasstilldown year-over-year and that's far from ideal, but adjusting for   these channel inventory dynamics, it looks like the decline was   ""just"" 9.4%.Product cycle dynamicsAnother factor that impacted the iPad results, at least   according to CEO Tim Cook, were product cycle dynamics.On the earnings call, Cook explained that in the year-ago   quarter, Apple had just launched its 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which he   reminded investors is ""the iPad with, obviously, the highest   price on it"".""We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the   product, and so that would have bolstered [average selling   prices] in that particular quarter"", Cook said.Indeed, Apple reported that in addition to iPad units being   down 19%, iPad revenue was down 22% in the most recent quarter,   suggesting a weaker product mix. Cook's commentary absolutely   makes sense here, especially as demand for the 12.9-inch model is   probably well below where it was when it first launched.Looking aheadOn the call, Cook tried to reassure investors that the company   has ""some exciting things coming on iPad"" and that he is ""very   optimistic about where [Apple] can take the product"".Unfortunately, Apple management has been bullish about the   iPad business for a while now, but it's still hard to see where   the bottom will ultimately be and even harder to predict how much   the business can grow once it hits that bottom.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Investors Turned 'Very Bullish' On Tech ETFs In January Amid Earnings;2/3/2017;"[ibd-display-video id=453308]ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings   reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the   iPhone 7 Plus,Apple(AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares   soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of   flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector   SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into   Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure   to this sector.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors   yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said   Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far   this year suggests thatETF   investorsare ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by   27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been   very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names includeMicrosoft(MSFT) andIntel(INTC) - tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven,   Internet of Things era - as well as chipmakersAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD),Texas Instruments(TXN),Microsemi(MSCC),Lam Research(LRCX) andKLA-Tencor(KLAC).Outliers includedAlphabet(GOOGL) andQualcomm(QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6%   expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA   Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR   S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism   about improving industry fundamentals.[ibdchart symbol=""xlk"" type=""daily"" size=""quarter""   position=""leftchart"" ]While earnings season has put technology   companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is   driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic   strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising   interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows   and consumption increases, tech companies will be the   beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of   ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of   corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under   President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech   sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted   at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of   his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed   abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone   maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at   a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday   could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going   forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding   Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a   strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the   onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign   markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four   dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make   extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches -   3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick   with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to   the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in   specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech   ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more   than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a   broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different   approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a   market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies,   including more small- and microcap stocks than most other   broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366   stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an   equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It   has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has   a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among   the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike   but offer very different exposures, which affects their   performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its   Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight   to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than   other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy,   given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on thestock marketon Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver     All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As     Trump Takes The Wheel"

That is consistent with what the charts are telling me.I'm buying here with a tight stop, $29.25, and looking for a move back into the mid-$30s, giving me a nice risk/reward setup.J: I agree with you about ignoring the analyst ratings. I use it as a contra-indicator. Did you read that recent WSJ article?H: You know that I do not read! I reach great conclusions from looking at charts. You humans read, but mostly to reaffirm your existing biases.J: I am delighted that our clients caught this at a lower price, but do you realize the stock was up over $1.50 today?H: No. I am enjoying the beach in Mexico. I sent in my pick, but that is like working overtime.J: Oscar's turf accountant would call your choice ""past posting.""H: Sorry. You are the one who set the schedule for Thursdays. I made the pick earlier, and it is still a good buy.J: There is a rumor of a possible takeover. Did you know about that?H: No. I just know a great rebound chart when I see one.J: Are you going to have any trouble returning from Mexico? The U.S. is taking a hard look at those returning from other countries.H: My papers are all in order. I'll be back in the office in a week or so.AthenaI admit it. I still have no new picks. We do not have the fresh, strongly trending stocks that I prefer. I'm still holding most of my most recent picks, and I have room for one more buy.J: Maybe you could give us an update on one of your current holdings.A: Fair enough. Irecommended United Rentals (URI) on 12/22  , after buying it myself a few days earlier.J: Isn't this one of your few picks where I agreed?A: Yes, I seem to remember that you said the pick was OK, but you did not own it yourself. I have held this one through a month or so of sideways movement, but now it's starting to pay off in a big way. We've seen an increase of roughly 20% in the last two weeks. That means it's about time for me to hop off this one (as fun of a ride as it's been).J: That certainly worked well. How are you doing overall?A: Not as well as the fussy guy and the dog, but that will change soon. I think I am Vince's favorite.FelixI will once again begin with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list.My list provides rankings within each zone, as well as the basics about buy, hold, and sell. The list includes the top overall vote getters from our (free) subscription list as well as some new requests I got during the week.J: The list has some interesting changes. I see that Apple (AAPL) (which we own) is still in ""hold"" territory despite the major rally after its earnings report.F: My ratings came before the report. How about Amazon (AMZN)? That did not do so well. My approach is geared to the long term, usually more than one year.J: Fair enough. Do you have something new for us this week?F: No.J: What? I took a long weekend, but the rest of you were supposed to keep working. Only Holmes was on vacation.F: I worked, but there are no new choices. Patience is called for.J: Are you trying to get dropped from the weekly discussion?F: You would not dare! My performance leads the group. In addition, I provide updated information to my many fans. You should be giving me a raise. I am on the job while the dog is in Mexico.J: OK, we'll let the readers decide whether they still want your opinions.OscarMy pick for this week is the Defense sector, shown here by the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR). I liked this one back in early December too - but I got out before the downslide. Now that the price has had a few weeks to level out, I feel more comfortable getting back into this sector.For my next ""investment"" - I'll bet that Belichick can't put together a defense to stop the Falcons. But that really is another subject…Here are my ratings for the top reader interests. Keep the questions coming. My sectors are aggressive, but have less risk than Felix's picks. I avoid the bad news from random, single-stock moves.J: Interesting. Do you see evidence of that?O: I hear about it. People are very worried about something called ""tweets"" that seem to hit their stocks for no reason. Playing sectors reduces that risk.J: Interesting. The Tweeter-in-Chief has T-Wopped a few of the defense stocks, but most still believe in his support for higher defense spending.O: I only follow sports tweets, but I know which sectors have legs, and which will fail down the stretch.J: You really like the Falcons?O: My week's pay is on the line!Background on the Stock ExchangeEach week Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their   friends. Since they are all traders they love to discuss their   best current ideas before the game starts. They like to call this   their ""Stock Exchange."" (Check it out for more background). Their methods are   excellent, as you know if you have been following the series.   Since the time frames and risk profiles differ, so do the stock   ideas. You get to be a fly on the wall from my report. I am the   only human present, and the only one using any fundamental   analysis.The result? Several expert ideas each week from traders, and a   brief comment on the fundamentals from the human investor. The   models are named to make it easy to remember their trading   personalities. Each week features a different expert or   stock.QuestionsIf you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector, even   those we did not mention, just ask! Put questions in the   comments. Address them to a specific expert if you wish. Each has   a specialty. Who is your favorite? (You can choose me, although   my feelings will not be hurt very much if you prefer one of the   models).ConclusionThe current trading environment is treacherous. Many frustrated traders are bailing out. Or have blown out. Political opinions about policy have proved to be a dangerous foundation for trading and investing.Our models provide a range of diverse ideas, all successful. Pick one that you like. Use it as a counterpoint for your own method. And keep control of position size and risk.The Stock Exchange does not have all the answers, but it     provides good ideas and a stimulus for your own trading.See alsoING: The Fundamentals Justify The Stock Price Momentumon seekingalpha.com"
4 Stocks That Are NOT Driven by the Trump Trade;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnyone who has been watching the markets for the past two months knows the far-reaching impact President Trump has had on stocks, bonds and currencies. Stock indices soared to all-time highs, bond prices dropped to 52-week lows and the value of the U.S. dollar climbed to highs last seen during the financial crisis.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf it seems like all sectors of the market were touched by the election, they were. President Trump's campaign promises, if enacted, have the ability to reach every corner of the stock market.His promised changes to the business tax code would impact every business. His promised changes to the personal income tax code would impact nearly every consumer. His promised infrastructure spending would increase inflation for the entire nation. His promised changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would impact nearly every employee. His promised relaxing of government regulations would affect nearly every employer. The list goes on and on.Looking at the market through this lens, there is not a company or stock that will not be impacted in some way by the Trump presidency. However, not all companies will be impacted to the same extent. Some companies are more vulnerable - for good or bad - to the promised policy changes than others.For instance, large banks and other financial institutions - likeGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - have been the unrivaled beneficiaries of a Trump presidency up to this point, because so many of the president's suggested changes benefit the banks' bottom lines. Rising inflation, lower corporate taxes and decreased regulation all benefit the banks.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryConversely, biotech companies - likeBiogen Inc(NASDAQ:BIIB) - have struggled in the aftermath of the presidential election because the uncertainty swirling around what will eventually replace the ACA after the Republican-controlled Congress repeals it, coupled with the pointedTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) and interview criticisms President Trump has issued regarding the high price of pharmaceuticals and other medical treatments, has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the healthcare industry.So which companies are less vulnerable to the potential policy changes and political whims of the president?While it's important to note that no company is immune from the potential threat of a targeted Twitter tirade from the president should it happen to draw his ire, there does seem to be a group of stocks that could bullishly go on its merry way during the first half of 2017 without having to look over its shoulder every morning to see if some new policy decision may threaten to derail its progress: the ""FANG"" stocks.The FANG stocks -Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) [formerly Google, hence the ""G""]  - have been Wall Street darlings for the past few years. The shift consumers have made to living in an online world for everything from their social networking to shopping has pushed the valuation of these companies ever higher as traders bet on this trend continuing, regardless of what else happens in the economy.The FANG stocks took an initial hit after the results of the presidential election were announced in early November, as traders started taking profits on some of their more lucrative positions and rotating that money into the financial sector and other sectors that were poised to rally following President Trump's win. Nobody was doubting the strength of the FANG stocks - they just needed to free up cash to invest in even hotter stocks at the time.Once the initial rotation was complete, investors started coming back to the FANG stocks, which were then trading at much more favorable valuations, and started buying them up. After all, whatever happens to inflation, whatever happens with the tax code, whatever happens with health care, consumers are going to continue connecting with friends on Facebook, buying more stuff on Amazon, watching videos on Netflix and searching for information on Google.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonWe expect the FANG stocks and other tech stocks like them - stocks likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) - to continue to do well during the next few months. We will certainly have to keep watching what the Trump administration does in the future (watching the net neutrality debate is going to be especially important for NFLX), but the traders on Wall Street aren't going to abandon their perpetual winners just yet.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

More iPhones, Less Profit;2/2/2017;"After three quarters of declining revenue and iPhone sales,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to return to growth during its first   fiscal quarter. Not only that, Apple put up some record numbers.   Revenue was $78.35 billion, up 3.3 % year over year and a new   quarterly record. EPS grew 2.4% to $3.36, also a new quarterly   record.iPhone unit sales surged 5% to 78.3 million, the most ever in   a single quarter. The company also set all-time revenue records   for services, Mac, and Apple Watch. There was a lot to like.Apple stocksurged the following day, with investors relieved that fears of a   continued slide in sales were overblown.While Apple put together a fine quarter, the company's results   aren't quite as good as they seem.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.A profit declineApple managed to grow its per-share earnings during the first   quarter, but a quick look at the income statement reveals a   different story. Apple increased its revenue by $2.48 billion   compared to the first quarter of last year, but cost of sales,   the cost of producing its products, surged $2.73 billion. Gross   profit declined by a little less than 1% as a result.So Apple sold more devices, but it accepted a lower gross   margin, and none of that extra revenue flowed through to the   bottom line. This gross profit decline and a 9% increase in   operating expenses led operating income to drop 3.4%. Net income   slumped by a smaller 1.6% thanks to an increase in other income,   which includes income for interest and dividends, among other   items.Apple was able to grow its EPS because of its expansive share   buyback program. The company's diluted share count declined by   4.8% year over year, fueled by billions of dollars of share   buybacks. Apple spent $10.9 billion on share buybacks during the   first quarter alone, an 57% increase compared to the prior-year   period.To be fair, Apple still generated $17.9 billion of net income   during the quarter, a staggering sum. But the fact that profit   and revenue are moving in opposite directions should be a concern   for investors. There's nothing wrong with share buybacks,   especially when cash continues to pile up. But they're the only   reason Apple was able to set an EPS record.An extra weekDid you know that Apple's first quarter this year had 14   weeks, compared to 13 weeks in the first quarter last year? If   you only read Apple's press release, this fact may come as a   surprise. Amongst all the talk of records, there's no mention of   the extra week. You would have had to delve into the 10-Q or   listen to the conference call in order to find recognition of   this substantial tailwind.If you just take the numbers and adjust them for this extra   week, the quarter doesn't look so good. Revenue would have   slumped 4.1%, iPhone unit sales would have declined 2.8%, and   operating income would have tumbled 10.3%. This is a simplistic   way to adjust for the extra week, as sales weren't spread out   uniformly throughout the quarter. But it gives a sense of how   significant an extra week can be.During the conference call, CFO Luca Maestri pointed to four   factors that offset this extra week. Slower growth of China   inventory, an earlier launch of the iPhone 7 compared to the   iPhone 6s in the previous year, a stronger U.S. dollar, and a   patent infringement payment in the first quarter of last year all   hurt the company's results relative to the prior-year period.Maestri doesn't say by what degree these factors offset the   extra week, and in the absence of an extra week, they would have   read like a list of excuses. Adjusted for that extra week,   Apple's first quarter wasn't as solid as the headline numbers   suggest. It almost certainly wasn't as bad as my simplistic   calculation above, but it puts an asterisk next to Apple's   numbers.The good news for Apple investors is that the company's   guidance for the second quarter was positive. Apple expects to   produce between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion of revenue, up   from $50.6 billion during the second quarter of last year. Gross   margin is expected to decline, which will again pressure Apple's   bottom line. But the major sales declines of the past few   quarters appear to be in the rearview mirror -- at least for   now.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock on This Q4 Earnings Dip;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few years ago, analysts had to add numbers from dozens of retail companies to see how Christmas went. Now they just wait on the earnings fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which came out after the market closed on Feb. 2. Unfortunately, Christmas wasn't as rosy as hoped, and AMZN stock is down about 4% in Thursday's after-market trade as a result.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazon's final numbers were somewhat mixed. AMZN beat estimates on the earnings front, bringing in $1.54 per share - better than the consensus mark of $1.40, and the company's seventh straight quarter of profit.But Amazon was light on revenues, at $43.74 billion versus expectations of $44.84 billion. That still was a big jump from the $35.75 billion in revs last year, but not enough to please investors or experts. That caused AMZN stock to drop 4% within minutes.Bad news for most, though some - includingBlue Chip Growtheditor Louis Navellier - were hoping to buy Amazon stock on the dip.CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized the variety of Amazon Prime servicesin his release, mentioning new offerings in gaming, storage, music and its Prime Now same-day shopping services. The company's studio launched hit shows likeThe Grand TourandMan in the High Castle, while the movieManchester by the Seadrew Oscar nominations but will debut on Prime within a few months.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryOur James Brumley was expecting fireworks after earnings, but most options traders were not making big bets either way. Most recently,I took some money off the table on Amazon, which as I noted was becoming a huge piece of my retirement savings.The biggest news from the analyst community was a super-bull call from Bill Miller, chairman of LMM Investments, claiming the value of AMZN stockcould double again in three years- making it more valuable thanApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). He also stating that Amazon now has higher gross margins thanWal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT), which regularly sells nearly $120 billion of merchandise each quarter - not just at Christmas.The big turn in Amazon stock started when the company started breaking out numbers from Amazon Web Services, its cloud services unit,after the first quarter of 2015. Since then, the company has more than doubled, as the unit has been growing at 50% per year and proving it can book one-fourth of that revenue as operating profit, even when accounting for stock options given its top employees.In the third quarter, for instance, AWS earned $861 million on revenues of $3.231 billion. Yes, that's more thanthe whole company earned. Amazon still loses money regularly on its international expansion, where it now brings in nearly one-third of its revenue. For the fourth quarter, AWS brought in revenue of $3.54 billion, which was seen as disappointing.Why Buy AMZN Stock Now?It's the expectation of huge growth on a massive scale that have made Amazon the fourth-largest company by market capitalization in the U.S. It recently passedBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B), whose revenues regularly run 50% better than Amazon's Christmas expectations.Shares dropped 5.1% the day after the third quarter missed expectations oOct. 27, and you could have gotten Amazon for $719 per share two weeks later, on Nov. 14. But since then the stock has been on fire, and closed before earnings near $840 per share.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret WeaponBuyers keep coming for Amazon because every quarter, it seems to do something spectacular.This quarter, for instance, it delivered a new credit card offering 5% all Amazon purchases to Prime members. It announced a new air hub near Cincinnati,sinking sharesofUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS) andFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX). Its Alexa personal assistant dominated the Consumer Electronics Show,as our Brad Moon reported.All this has made AMZN stock a must-have for a growing number of small investors, who race in whenever the stock stumbles.Just like it did this afternoon.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Apple's Biggest Growth Engine (Services) Coming of Age;2/2/2017;"While iPhones returning to growth is good news of course, it's evident that the business has lost momentum. Penetration levels have increased significantly with the scope for further innovation shrinking with each new product generation. So users not just in traditional markets but also in some emerging markets have less of a reason to upgrade.Since AppleAAPLsells a high-end product, its market is further limited. So a jump in the holiday sales doesn't excite me as much as the fact that the number of iPhone users increased double-digits during the quarter. Because it is the installed base of over a billion active devices that Apple can count on to use its services and generate recurring revenue for the company.What Services Did This QuarterApple's service revenue grew 13.4% sequentially and 18.4% year over year to around $7.2 billion. Management said that growth would have been higher taking out the one-time receipt of $548 million in the year-ago quarter and adjusting for the extra week of sales in December. This is the fourth straight quarter that services grew strong double-digits and contributed an equal or greater share of revenue than both Macs and iPads, making it the second most significant segment behind iPhones.At just 9% of revenue, Apple however has no legal compulsion to provide too much detail on what this business is about. It does offer interesting tidbits though such as the paid subscriptions number that was over 150 million in the last quarter.Consequently, services include a motley crowd, the chief of which is the App Store. This business ""broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever,"" in the words of CEO Tim Cook. Over 2.2 million developers are currently working on apps for the App Store and payments to developers have now topped $60 billion.So it isn't surprising that both the average revenue per customer account and the number of customer accounts grew strongly. Apple also quoted App Annie as saying that App Store revenue more than doubled Google Play revenue in calendar 2016. Another positive about this business is that it isn't geographically limited, meaning that even a soft market like China is currently contributing to sales.Apple Music grew for the third straight quarter as Apple enabled downloads in addition to the streaming business. It has had good luck with exclusive content to date and is currently looking at original content to further push things.Apple Pay users tripled, transaction volumes jumped 500% running into the billions of dollars as the service expanded to Japan, Russia, New Zealand and Spain. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting payments through Apple Pay.AppleCare is closely linked to the growth in the installed base, so it continues to grow strongly.iCloud storage services are doing well, and that's all that Apple will say about it.Why's This So Important?It's hard to overstate the importance of this segment as mobile computing devices race to their saturation point. Device sales overall are coming down and what little growth is there today will be gone tomorrow. Upgrades will be fewer and sales will depend on the ability to take market share.The other reason is profitability. Management says very little about the margin profile and makes sure we understand that there are many parts to this business that don't generate the same margins. But they also say that the segment carries higher margins than the rest of the business.This makes perfect sense since hardware generally carries lower margins than software that is increasingly offered as a service these days. So as the mix of this business grows, it will fetch stronger margins for Apple.Also, while Apple has successfully convinced customers its devices are worth the money, hardware innovation hasn't been that great in recent times and could get more difficult going forward. So differentiation could be rooted in the software ecosystem more than it has been thus far.Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

What's Next for iPhones After Strong Holiday Quarter?;2/2/2017;"AppleAAPLshares jumped over 6% yesterday after the company returned to growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. A lot of the optimism was on account of iPhone sales, which grew 4.7% from last year to the highest ever tally of 78.3 million units or around two-thirds of total sales. Street estimates varied between 77-78 million units.Apple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. Quote""iPhone's Best Performance for Over a Year""Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement that this was the iPhone's best performance in over a year, putting it back on top as the world's largest smartphone vendor. But he also said that the numbers were helped by the Samsung Note 7 fiasco. As a result, Samsung didn't see as much of the fourth-quarter bump-up as it usually does (it still managed a 29% share in the U.S. compared to Apple's 31%, according to Kantar Worldpanel).Apple's growth rate was also slightly lower than in the year-ago quarter, and was likely impacted by the stronger dollar and by stiff competition from local players in China like Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, OPPO and Vivo that may have led to a loss in market share. Revenues from China were down 12% in the last quarter. Tim Cook used an optimistic tone: ""I'm encouraged with the significant improvement but we're not without challenges there.""He also said that sales would have been stronger if demand for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus hadn't been underestimated. As it turned out, the more expensive device was more popular based on new features like better cameras and more RAM, which therefore led to a supply shortage. If it wasn't such a competitive market, this may not have been such a bad problem to have.However, it does reverse an earlier trend that saw the iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 6 Plus growing slower than their less expensive partners. It also seems to indicate that customers are unwilling to upgrade without meaningful new features, but will pay more for them when they're there.As a result, the two new models that also came with water resistance while ditching the headphone socket accounted for 17% of iPhone sales, according to research firm Localytics, as reported in the media. This also raised the average selling price to $695 from $691 in the year-ago quarter.The Good and Bad Going ForwardSmartphone sales growth rates are not going to come back to where they've been the last few years. For example, consider that the iPhone 6 launch in Sep 2014 was followed by a 46% increase in shipments the following quarter. This kind of growth is history, because penetration continues to increase across the world.Second, Apple's growth rates have also been fueled by market share gains in China, which may not be repeated for a number of reasons including greater penetration, the stronger dollar, a more difficult operating environment, the increasingly strained relations between China and the U.S. and the abundant supply of local makes of varying price tags.Third, Apple is likely to maintain or even grow share in developed markets and markets with higher penetration on the strength of its brand. But these upgrades will be dependent on innovation. Tim Cook says: ""The smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,"" and ""I think there's lots more to do... We've got some exciting things in the pipeline. I still feel really, really good about it."" But if the upgrades over the past two years are anything to go by, it seems that there's a limit to that innovation.That of course brings us to the question of the upcoming iPhone 8 that is expected to have an all-new design, glass casing and other exciting features. Plus, it's the iPhone's 10thanniversary, so there's some pent-up excitement there. If Apple delivers in line with the hype, it should have blockbuster sales. Beginning in the September quarter when it will launch that is and provided Apple doesn't under-supply the things. Until then, we should expect customers to hold off purchases (more so than in earlier years because the excitement for the new phone is more this time).The other somewhat positive factor is India where Apple's talks with government officials appear to be going well. India is a faster-growing market than China at the moment because of relatively lower penetration, a rising middle class and the Prime Minister's stated goal of digitizing the nation. Once Apple starts building its stores in the region, its brand value is bound to appreciate and translate into increased sales for the company.

The International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Dip Beckons to Profit-Seekers;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTraders seeking strength are flocking to theNasdaqin droves. The tech-laden index continues to be the best looking of the bunch, and its dominance has only increased during earnings season. Solid performance fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) following their respective earnings releases has helped keep the good times rolling. But do you know which heavy hitter may be sporting the best opportunity right now?International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrLet's take a deep dive into the chart of IBM stock to see what kind of trade we can drum up.Like the lion's share of the equities market, IBM jumped into an uptrend following last year's election and it hasn't looked back since. The tech titan entered the new year with a solid high base pattern that created a breakout opportunity for technical traders.And they didn't have to wait long. Big Blue's earnings beat from Jan. 19 served as the excuse for buyers to come rushing in.The action in IBM stock since then has been textbook. After breaching the $170 resistance level, the stock gained a quick ten bucks before the bulls' fury finally faded.5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for RetirementSince then, mild profit-taking has created an attractive four-day pullback. Traders loath to chase now have their opportunity to scoop up shares at a discount.Source: OptionsAnalytixRecent volume patterns have also been favoring buyers. The post-earnings breakout was accompanied by a handful of accumulation days suggesting institutions were entering the fray with aggression. And while the stock has retreated in recent days, the volume has been muted suggesting a lack of any real conviction by sellers here.Throw it all together, and this IBM stock dip looks like a buy.IBM Stock Calendars, Anyone?With earnings fading in the distance, IBM options have become cheap again. And that means long option trades carry much less risk. Let's build a calendar spread to capitalize on further upside in the stock over the coming month.First, buy to open the Apr $170 call for around $7.60. Then, sell to open the Mar $180 call for around $1.25. This creates a diagonal call spread for a net debit of $6.35. The max loss is limited to the initial debit and will be forfeited if IBM sits below $170 at Apr expiration.Why Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment BizTo minimize the loss, I suggest exiting if the stock breaks the $165 support level.The max profit is around $400 and will be captured if IBM sits right at $180 at March expiration. Since the April option will only have one month remaining at March expiration, I suggesting exiting at that point.At the time of this writing, Tyler Craig had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postThe International Business Machines Corp.

Loeb believed the move would increase the value of Sony stock and reward shareholders … and another weak quarter for the division makes that memory all the more painful.makeArticleAd();Source:WikipediaLoeb has since sold his stake, after being the largest shareholder with 6% of shares, but new rumors see Sony selling off part of the unit. SNE stock is ready to roll in 2017 if this move finally comes into play.TheNew York Postreports that Sony is listening to pitches from interested parties in the Sony Entertainment division. Rumors seeCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS), a Chinese media company, or a technology company likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) orFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) acquiring this asset from Sony.An outright sale of the division that includes movies and television would differ from Loeb's original plan, which called for the entertainment unit going public and including Sony Music.On Thursday, Sony reported a weak fiscal third quarter due to the movies division. SNE lost $913 million in the pictures division - thanks to a $962 million write-down - bringing Q3 profits down to $169 million. Even without the one time event, the division was very weak compared to last year's third quarter, which thrived thanks to the James Bond installmentSpectre.Why a Sony Entertainment Sale Could Still WorkThose results aside, though, the Sony Entertainment division is incredibly valuable in today's content monetization world. The company creates movies and television series - and naturally could produce more - that would fit well for many acquiring companies. Within Sony, this division often is buried under a focus on video games, televisions, and smartphone technology.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruarySNE has struggled to produce high box-office gross from its movie division, but that could change with its 2017 lineup. This year, the studio will release sequels to movies likeTrainspottingandSmurfs. The studio will also release a remake ofJumanji, with a prominent Dec. 22 opening date. Along with theSmurfs: The Lost Village, Sony is betting on its animated offerings with other titlesThe Emoji MovieandThe Staralso coming in 2017.While some reports say Sony is waiting to sell the division until it sees how strong the opening ofThe Emoji Movieis, I have to believe that they are waiting for another small movie coming out on July 7. You might have heard of it. It's calledSpider-Man: Homecoming. Sony has had better luck in terms of overall box office revenue and market share in years when a Spider-Man movie has been released.This could be the perfect time to monetize the entertainment division for the company and reward owners of SNE stock.In2016, Sony held only an 8.3% market share of the U.S. box office with $943.5 million grossed from 36 movies. This was the highest number of movies released among the main studios. Sony ranked well behindWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS),Time Warner Inc.(NYSE:TWX),NBC/UniversalandNews Corp's(NASDAQ:NWSA) Fox, who all grossed more than $1.5 billion domestically during the year. Only two Sony movies (GhostbustersandAngry Birds) grossed more than $100 million domestically.This has been a common theme, and also one of the reasons why the entertainment division is so unpredictable for a large technology company like Sony. In 2015, the studio barely cleared $1 billion thanks to two decent-performing movies inSpectreandHotel Transylvania2.A Big Lineup AheadAs mentioned above, releasing a Spider-Man movie has been a good thing for SNE and could lift Sony stock soon.Back in 2014, Sony finished fourth with a market share of 12% and $1.3 billion domestically.The Amazing Spider-Man 2grossed $202.9 million domestically and another $506.1 million internationally. In 2012, Sony ranked second at the box office with a 16.5% market share and $1.8 billion in domestic box office revenue.SkyfallandThe Amazing Spider-Manled the way with $291 million and $262 million, respectively.The Amazing Spider-Mangrossed an additional $496 million in international markets.Along with a strong 2017 planned, Sony's movie division is also releasing additional Spider-Man movies,Bad Boys 3,Bad Boys 4,Hotel Transylvania 3,Goosebumps 2,Barbieand more animated movies. Other intellectual properties owned include Charlie's Angels, 21 Jump Street, Ghostbusters, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Men in Black.Make Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade AgainThe time for SNE to sell this asset could absolutely be now as it has a decent pipeline, can capitalize on the Spider-Man results, and may full well know the best is behind it. The company lost the rights to the James Bond movies and has only released two of its top 10 grossing movies since 2010 (SkyfallandThe Amazing Spider-Man).Sony Entertainment has more to offer a new owner than just movies. The division also produces and distributes television shows, and has a handful of media networks, with a strong presence internationally. The division's global footprint covers 178 countries and more than 1.4 billion subscribers.Hit television shows under the Sony umbrella includeBetterCall Saul,Jeopardy,BlackishandShark Tank. The television division has really grown, and could be the biggest reason this asset is undervalued, and sets up a big win for Sony stock. In the 2015-16 season, Sony had 33 series on the air. That is a sharp increase from the 15 a decade ago in 2005-06.Bottom Line for Sony StockAdd it all up and you have a top five movie studio, an increasing producer of original content for numerous channels, owner of strong intellectual property and syndicated programs, and an international television channel owner. Those assets will make Sony's Entertainment arm incredibly valuable to CBS, a Chinese media company or whoever is currently sniffing around.Sony may be hesitant to let go of the entertainment arm that has helped to make up for weakness in the electronics markets in years past. Thursday's Q3, however, showed just how much trouble the movie business is in.The company should capitalize on its upcoming slate and reward Sony stock holders shareholders with a sale of the division.As of this writing, Chris Katje did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postWhy Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment Bizappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."
Make Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade Again;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAyuuugenarrative inBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) and other financials has lost a bit of steam in recent days. Nevertheless and as you'll soon see, that's a very good thing for shares … and even better if you're willing to trade BAC stock.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrToday, I have an idea for some financial engineering that won't break the bank.Following a massive rally spurred by President Trump-inspired idealism on everything from deregulation to a corporate tax boon to beneficial re-inflation conditions, BAC stock has gone nowhereveryfast over the past few weeks.Investors are now busy backtracking on a bit of the market's notorious perfect pricing mechanism. That has put a lid on BofA. A newer, bearish narrative of protectionist policies and potential trade wars have been stealing the spotlight in recent days since the new administration took the reins.At the end of the day, market narratives happen all the time. It's the gray in-between area where history is eventually written.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryMaybe Goldman Sachs knows what tomorrow, next week or the next four years look like, but it's good to have an investment backstop - like options on BAC stock - rather than rely too aggressively on the""Trump put.""BAC Stock ChartClick to EnlargeBank of America hasremoved the downside risksassociated with an extremely overbought condition. What's more, the price action also indicates a breakout and rally are imminent.Admittedly, our prior technical case of BAC - prone to a corrective move into the $20-$21 area - proved too ambitious with a low of $21.77 for the period. But as both price and time are important factors in determining a correction; some good work has been provided in Bank of America.Subsequent price movement in BAC stock has consolidated brisk gains of around 35% to establish a neutral, but constructive seven- to eight-week flat base pattern. So while the depth of BofA's correction came up short of our forecast, the duration spent and firmness of the bid suggests the upside outweighs the downside risks at this juncture.Now, for the trade.How to Trade BAC Stock HereGiven the continued supportive dynamics working hard to make BofA great again, and the removal of earnings risk, I like a modified collar combination right now.Sell an Apr $25 call and buy the Apr $22/$20 bear put spread for $23.10, as of BAC's current price of $23.02. A bullish investor maintains about 8.5% of upside into April expiration with the sold $25 call capping profits at $1.90 per spread.The max gain on BAC is unadjusted and on an expiration basis, with the potential for larger gains by rolling the position beyond the initial hedge.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EOn the flipside, if BAC stock fails to move higher and declines in price, the bear put spread portion of the combo affords the trader a partial but very effective hedge from $20-$22.Under ideal conditions, the spread works to buffer the loss in share price, dollar-for-dollar. But even during a less agreeable price swing lower, this modified collar should greatly curtail downside risk on BAC stock - and in our view trumps other alternatives quite nicely.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

The site raked in $8.83 billion, higher than the $8.52 billion that analysts expected. Earnings came in at a stellar $1.41 per share, which was well ahead of the $1.31 per share that analysts polled byThomson Reuterswere calling for over the three months.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryOne of the most important milestones that Facebook reached to end the year came in the form of its active monthly users around the globe, which rose to 1.86 billion. The figure was slightly ahead of the 1.84 billion that was projected. Active daily users amounted to 1.23 billion by the end of the month, about 40 million higher than estimates.FB grew 0.7% after hours Wednesday, but Facebook stock is down 1.2% today.Metlife Inc (MET)Metlife's quarterly figuresmissed the markWednesday afternoon. The insurance company announced that it earned $1.28 per share, which was weaker than the $1.35 per share that Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Operating profit for the period came in at $1.42 billion, which was $40 million higher than what Metlife posted the prior year in the same quarter. Overall, the company posted a net loss of $2.09 billion.The disappointing results can be partially attributed to the company's decision to increase interest rates, which reduced the carrying value of its derivatives book. Investment income was a bright spot, enjoying a 2.5% boost to $5.04 billion. Operating earnings in Europe and Asia were also strong, wafting up 33.3% and 22%, respectively.MET stock fell 1.6% after the bell yesterday, and is down 5.2% in early morning trading.Symantec Corporation (SYMC)Symantec Operation had mixed results for itsfiscal third quarterof 2016.Earnings minus items came in at 32 cents per share, rising 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015.

These days, an earnings miss or a warning on guidance can be enough to send a stock down by the double digits.If you're a value investor, your first thought upon seeing a big sell off in a stock is probably ""is that stock cheap enough for me to buy now?""There have been some juicy sell offs already this earnings season. Additionally, some other ""favorite"" stocks that many people own seem out of favor or down on their luck.Are These Favorite Stocks Cheap Enough to Be Values?1. Under Armour (NYSE:UAA-Free Report) sold off 25% on its first earnings miss in 5 years. Shares are now down over 50% from their highs. But is it a value?2. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX-Free Report) went nowhere after its earnings reports. Shares also fell 9% in the last year, underperforming the market. The company appears to be out-of-favor with investors. (In full disclosure, Tracey is a long-term owner of it in her personal portfolio.) Should value investors be taking a look?3. Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE:SHAK-Free Report) was once the darling of Wall Street but shares have fallen 19% over the last 2 years. Is the growth catching up with the valuation now?4. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) just reported earnings. Revenues surprised the Street. Is it one of the few technology stocks that might be a value stock?5. Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE:WSM-Free Report) owns one of the top brands in home furnishings: West Elm. But it's other brands are struggling. It doesn't report earnings until March but should value investors be keeping an eye on this retailer?Investors should always dig deeper than simply the value fundamentals before making a decision to buy a stock. Does the company have rising earnings estimates? What does the growth picture look like?Just because a company has always been an expensive growth stock doesn't mean it always will be in the future.Find out more about what Tracey thinks about the buying opportunities in these popular stocks in this week's podcast.Have a question for Tracey?Do you have a value investing question for Tracey?Is there a topic you really want covered on an upcoming Value Investor Podcast?She wants to hear from you.Send your questions for Tracey to her e-mail address at:podcast@zacks.com.Want more insights from Tracey?Check out her weekly Value Investor service to receive more in-depth analysis on value companies and see which stocks she thinks are the best bargains now.Click here to learn more.Tracey Ryniec is the Value Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bloom is off the rose for the ""Trump rally,"" and Wall Street is finally taking the new administration at its word as U.S. stock futures are headed broadly lower this morning. A string of geopolitical issues from President Donald Trump has traders worried, including potentialnew sanctions on Iran, the threat ofsending troops to Mexicoand a heated exchange with the Australian prime minister.makeArticleAd();As a result, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.23%,S&P 500futures are off 0.22% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.23%.On the options front, call activity rebounded amid a string of strong quarterly reports from the tech sector. Overall, about 16.5 million calls and 14.2 million puts crossed the tape yesterday. On the CBOE, however, put activity remained a potent driver, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arriving at 0.71 and the 10-day moving average hitting another three-month high of 0.69.As for Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call options chased yesterday's post-earnings rally as the company offered up a much-needed win. Elsewhere,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) also drew heavy call volume ahead of last night's quarterly report andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) extended its blistering 12-month rally to more than 430% on the heels of another blowout quarter.Apple Inc. (AAPL)After posting three straight quarters of declining revenue and faltering earnings, Apple finally hit it big. For the holiday quarter, Apple said it earned $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion, easily besting expectations for $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.42 billion.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAccording to CEO Tim Cook, the results were ""Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""But while AAPL options traders attempted to chase the rally with calls, Wednesday's post-earnings call volume (as a percentage of total volume) still came in light. Total volume reached a whopping 3.34 million contracts yesterday, with calls accounting for a below average 61% of the day's take. Still, 3.34 million contracts is quite impressive, and adds up to quite a lot of call activity on AAPL stock.On the other hand, some traders appear to be fading the rally already, as open interest at the 3 Feb $128 and $127 strikes surged to more than 10,000 contracts each. AAPL is trading slightly lower in premarket action this morning, and broad market headwinds could place these puts in the money by weeks end.Facebook Inc (FB)Facebook stepped into the earnings limelight after the close last night to post itsseventh-straight earnings beat. The company said sales surged 53% to $8.83 billion, with earnings arriving at $1.41 per share. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.52 billion. Additionally, daily active users (DAUs) rose 18% to 1.23 billion, mobile DAUs were up 23% at 1.15 billion and mobile ad revenue came in at 84% of all advertising revenue.FB stock options traders were quite bullish heading into the report, with calls accounting for 64% of the nearly 1.6 million contracts traded. FB is trading roughly 0.6% higher this morning, with the shares set to open in record high territory north of $135.Currently, there are 12,700 calls open at the $135 strike in the 3 Feb series, with another 12,000 at $137 and 12,700 at the $140 strike. If buying pressure can overcome broad market headwinds, FB could make a run at $137, but $140 may be unreachable until the end of next week.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD solidified its position in the semiconductor hot seat yesterday when the company blew past Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations.For the quarter, AMD narrowed its loss to a penny per share on revenue of $1.11 billion, compared to expectations for a loss of two cents per share on $1.07 billion in sales.What's more, AMD said its Ryzen should hit shelves by March and that the much-anticipated graphics processor should boost revenue by 18%.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EAMD options traders were all over call contracts yesterday, with these typically bullish best making up 66% of the 712,000 contracts traded - well above average for AMD. As of yesterday's close, the stock is trading north of all but the most bullish of heavy call OI strikes in the Feb. series, with 1,400 contracts at $12.50 and 1,100 at $13.However, there is a bit of profit taking going on this morning, with AMD pulling back by about 1.5% amid broad market selling pressure. Profit taking might not be a bad idea at the moment, as a consolidation period is warranted after yesterday's 16% surge.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Are Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) and Fitbit Inc (FIT) the Perfect Long/Short Play?;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecent statistics from the two wearable rivals suggest thatGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) is winning the war againstFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), making a hypothetical long/short play between the two stocks a very interesting proposition.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitHowever, thinking about buying Garmin and shorting Fitbit stock - and actually following through with it - are two entirely different beasts.I have never shorted a stock and likely never will; I'm just not built that way. Whenever I'm asked byInvestorPlace, or any of the other financial publications I write for, to do a ""sell"" piece on a stock or a group of stocks, I always have a tougher time coming up with recommendations.I like to write about stocks that I would consider owning; negative spin doesn't enter my psyche. I can do it, it's just harder.This brings me to GRMN stock and FIT stock, the crux of this story.Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Can't Fall Much Lower Than ThisIn Q3 2016, Garmin shipped 1.3 million wearable devices, a 12.2% year-over-year increase. That compares to an 11.0% YOY increase for Fitbit. In Q2 2016, Garmin shipped 1.6 million wearable devices, a 106.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier, while Fitbit shipped 5.7 million wearable devices, a 28.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier.So, in the nine months ended September 2016, Garmin shipped 3.8 million wearable devices, a 40.7% increase year over year. Meanwhile, Fitbit shipped 15.8 million wearable devices, a 21.5% increase year over year.Between Q1 2015 and Q3 2016, Garmin's market share dropped by 40 basis points to 5.7%. During the same 18-month period, Fitbit's market share dropped 980 basis points to 23.0%.Fitbit Stock Continues to DeclineSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and the many others that compete for the 50% market share not held by Fitbit,Xiaomi, Garmin, andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stand to benefit the most.Garmin is a big company and wearables are but one of many revenue streams. A 40-basis-point decline isn't a big deal for a company that generated $2.2 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, an increase of 5.8%. If not for its auto segment (its largest by revenue), which saw a 17% decline year over year to $656.0 million, 2016 has been a winner.Over at Fitbit, the top line has been outstanding, with revenue growing 39.3% through the first nine months of the year to $1.6 billion. However, it's the bottom line that gets a little wonky.In the quarter ended Oct. 1, 2016, Fitbit's operating profit declined 33.1% to $44.4 million; for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, operating income declined 69.3% to $72.9 million. R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses all have seen huge increases in 2016 as Fitbit struggles to remain on top of a wearables market that's slowing faster than anyone expected.InvestorPlacecontributor Aaron Levitt recently discussed Fitbit stock in relation to aslowing wearables market; he was pretty blunt in his assessment of the job CEO James Park is doing guiding the company through a rough patch that's seen FIT stock decline by 65% over the past year.""Both eMarketer and IDC both cite smartwatches as the big reason for the declines,"" wrote Levitt. ""Consumers just can't see the need for them as they overlap on features already found in smartphones. And when adding their heftier price tags, smartwatches are a fading fad.""So, what does Fitbit do to counter the fact that wearables' 2016 growth will be less than half the 60% projection at the start of the year? It buys not one, but two companies that make smartwatches.Bottom Line on Fitbit and GarminIf Fitbit continues to waste money on bad acquisitions and wasteful overhead that doesn't move the needle, you can bet that Fitbit's comfy cash position - $672 million in cash and marketable securities as of Q3 - will be gone faster than you can shake a stick at.So, should you go long on Garmin? Absolutely. With$1.1 billionin cash and marketable securities, no debt, and an operating margin of almost 21%, GRMN stock is a long-term hold.3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionAs for shorting FIT stock, I'm of two minds on this.Yes, theshorts represent almost 36% of its floatand its margins are about one-third Garmin's, but with $3 in cash it's got to be attractive to somebody in the industry - maybe even Garmin. That should keep Fitbit stock from dropping much farther.So, I wouldn't recommend investors buy or short Fitbit stock. Neither proposition looks like it will be a winner any time soon.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsHere's How Apple Inc.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/E;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the biggest negatives surroundingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the company's sky-high price-to-earnings ratio. According to Google Finance, AMZN stock currently trades at an eye-popping 191 times its trailing earnings of $4.36 per share.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut Amazon has at least given investors the courtesy of growing profits to try to somewhat justify the lofty valuation. That 191x is on trailing 12-month earnings of $4.36 per share. In fiscal 2015, AMZN earned $596 million, or $1.25 per share. In 2014, it lost $241 million, which translates into 52 cents per share.It's obvious Amazon stock investors care about growth, not valuation. AMZN's sky-high P/E has been in place for years, and will likely continue for some time.And that's actually OK. Here are two important reasons why:Amazon Revenue GrowthAmazon is still one of the best growth stories in today's market.When the company releases 2016's final numbers Thursday, Feb. 2, analysts expect Amazon to post revenue of $137 billion. That's an improvement of more than 25% versus 2015's top line - a difficult feat when you're talking about 12-digit sales. And Amazon's $107 billion in revenue last year was 20% better than 2014.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryWe live in a world in whichS&P 500constituents are doing well if they're posting just single-digit increases on the top line. You can blame this at least partly on the strong U.S. dollar, which is weighing down American multinationals. But the fact remains that meaningful growth is a scarce quality in today's stock market - especially among blue-chip stocks.Thus, AMZN stock is an easy way for investors to get access to big growth with relatively little risk.And Amazon is hardly running out of fuel. The company has only begun to expand into grocery and apparel - two huge categories. Trillions of dollars are spent worldwide each year at physical stores. That's not to mention the other gains Amazon still could make via the smart home, Amazon Web Services cloud offerings and other newer initiatives.Analysts predict Amazon's revenue will increase another 22% in 2017, hitting $168 billion. So again - the growth story is still well intact.But it's not all about growth. Many AMZN stock bulls argue that we're just looking at earnings the wrong way.Amazon Earnings: Better Than They Seem?One thing that separates Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos from many other executives is his ability to look at the really,reallylong-term. He's also willing to spend billions of dollars on ideas, and is OK with hitting a few duds if it means spawning great new ideas.Remember the company's smartphone? The Amazon Music Importer? How about a website called Askville? I'm guessing you might remember the Fire smartphone, but not the other two. Amazon lost $170 million on its smartphone alone.This kind of risk taking is an inherent part of Amazon's culture. It's the line of thinking that prodded the company to introduce some of its biggest winners to date, like cloud services, Prime shipping and the Kindle.Thus, many investors look at AMZN stock in a different way. They look at the company's operating profit, then they add back its substantial research and development costs to get a ""truer"" sense of profitability.Admittedly, that changes the picture dramatically.Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL)In its most recent quarter, Amazon produced net income of $252 million, which across 485 million diluted shares became diluted earnings of 52 cents per share. At the time, AMZN was trading at $822 per share. If we annualize that profit (not a perfect measure, as quarterly earnings fluctuate - this is just for an example), we're looking at a P/E of 395.But Amazon also reported operating profits of $575 million, and spent $4.14 billion on R&D - a significant expense. Add those together, and you get $4.715 billion, or $9.72 per share. Annualize that, then divide the share price by that, and you get a P/E of about 21.Let's take the actual numbers. Amazon currently trades for 190 times trailing 12-month earnings, as we said above. However, over the past four quarters, Amazon spent $15.11 billion on R&D and posted operating profits of more than $4 billion. That comes to $40.19 per share combined, and puts AMZN stock at a P/E of just more than 20.That's a lot of creative accounting, so take that with a spoonful of salt. But it's an interesting argument.Bottom Line on AMZN StockAmazon continues to be one of the best growth stories in today's market. As long as that continues, investors aren't going to care about the headline P/E ratio. It just doesn't matter. AMZN stock has doubled several times over despite it.Amazon is solidly profitable, even if the bottom line isn't as large as investors typically would like. But those earnings are being reinvested back in the business - which is what a high-growth company like Amazon should be doing anyway.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL);2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) rallied a strong 6% on Wednesday following the company's latest earnings report. While the rally was impressive, AAPL stock is now bumping into some critical technical resistance that bulls and bears alike should be aware of.makeArticleAd();Simply put, Apple's near- to possibly medium-term upside is limited at best.Apple's revenues in the latest quarter came in at a record $78.4 billion, which in part was helped by strong holiday demand for the new iPhone 7 series. These numbers are impressive, and I continue to be a longer-term believer in the company - particularly around the potential of AAPL being able to monetize deeper on the devices ecosystem through more services.When Ilast discussed shares of Appleon Dec. 28, 2016, I offered that if AAPL stock could clear above the $118 price level, then a next upside target around $123 would come into sight. Apple met and surpassed this target on Wednesday following the earnings announcement.From that perspective, Apple shares have now reached an important upside price target.AAPL Stock ChartsLet's take a step back and look at the multiyear weekly chart of AAPL stock. We see that despite the big swing lower from the 2015 highs into the mid-2016 lows, and most recently back up toward the 2015 highs, Apple has, largely speaking, not really accomplished much since early 2015.Click to EnlargeBulls, however, note that the May 2016 lows coincided with critical technical support made up of horizontal support (lower purple-dotted line) as well as the 200-week simple moving average (red). Equally important, on the other hand, is that after Wednesday's post-earnings rally, AAPL is now within a few points of these aforementioned previous all-time highs from 2015. Through a technical lens, this could offer up as much resistance as the 2015 lows offered support.In other words, before Apple stock can sustainably break to new all-time highs, a consolidation phase most likely is in order.Looking at the daily chart, we see that since mid-November 2016, AAPL stock has now rallied approximately 25%, which is not a small move for the stock to accomplish in a matter of two-and-a-half months.Click to EnlargeA simple yet accurate observation through the lens of technical analysis is that old all-time highs are not easily overcome on the first try, particularly if the stock has not consolidated below or near those previous all-time highs for some time.Apple's current chart thus is in dire need of some consolidation before it can make a better attempt at fresh all-time highs on a more sustainable basis.How to Trade Apple Stock HereI see two specific trades setting up:If AAPL stock breaks and holds below Wednesday's intraday lows around $127, then the stock could be played from the short side for a mean-reversion move back into the mid- to low $120s. Alternatively, options traders could also look to sell out-of-the-money call spreads on the stock at that time.Quicker traders could look to buy AAPL stock for fast profits should the stock push and hold above Wednesday's intraday highs around $130.50 for a move toward the 2015 highs around $133.Either way, upside in AAPL stock through a multiweek/multimonth lens is likely limited. Trades should be constructed accordingly.Like what you see? Sign up for our dailyBeat the Belle-letter and get Serge's investment advice delivered to your inbox every morning!

The S&P 500 Holds in the Face of Uncertainty;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday, shares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 6.1% following a report that showed an increased demand for its iPhone 7. The record increase in revenues of $78.4 billion ended a record of three consecutive quarters of declines, and helped theDow Jones Industrial Averagegain 0.1% by adding 51 points to the index. Apple's gain also helped propel theNasdaqto a gain for the day of 0.5%.makeArticleAd();Apple's gain helped the session to open higher, but the positive impact of one stock's opening didn't' last long. All of the gains of the opening were lost by noon. However, following the noon hour's lows, a Federal Reserve decision to leave interest rates unchanged, and several positive economic reports helped gain back about half of the morning's losses enabling the major indices to close with modest gains.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAt the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 27 points at 19,891, theS&P 500eked out a point at 2,280, the Nasdaq rose 28 points to close at 5,643 and theRussell 2000closed at 1,361, unchanged. The NYSE's primary exchange traded 1 billion shares with total volume of 3.9 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.2 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners edged out advancers by 1.1-to-1, while the Nasdaq broke even. The NYSE's blocks were reported as 6,510 down from 6,786 on Tuesday.Click to EnlargeIn spite of the many underlying uncertainties, the S&P 500 (and the Nasdaq) have maintained support. The S&P 500's December high at 2,277 is the ""line in the sand"" for this major index, as is Nasdaq's January high at 5,574.Conclusion:The January closing highs of the major indices are breakout points that must hold if the short-term and intermediate-term trend is to remain intact.A gap exists on the 500 from 2,292 to 2,286. That gap was partially closed by yesterday's intraday high at 2,289. This technical issue is an important focus for this major index, since a failure to proceed higher could easily lead to a 5% to 10% correction. So far the major indices have resisted the anxiety produced by many uncertainties, choosing to hold or buy rather than give in to the sellers.The line at 2,277 was pierced but recovered. The question now is, ""Can it hold?""Today's Trading LandscapeTo see a list of the companies reporting earnings today,click here.For a list of this week's economic reports due out,click here.Tell us what you think about this article!

5 Top Dividend Aristocrats to Buy in February;2/2/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates in February, providing no update on the next hike. The Fed's reluctance in raising rates should stand in good stead for dividend aristocrats.President Donald Trump's travel ban, in the meanwhile, could result in a possible rise in erratic share price movement this month. The stock market has also, traditionally, seen weak results this month, especially after an election. In such a scenario, investing in dividend aristocrats  seems prudent as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the 'holy grail' of investing.Fed Leaves Rates UnchangedAs widely expected, the Fed has kept rates unchanged following a two-day policy meeting on Feb 1. The central bank kept its benchmark overnight lending rate target at a range of 0.5% to 0.75%. The bank had lifted rates by a quarter percentage point in December, marking the second hike in more than 10 years.In fact, the central bank penciled three quarter-point moves this year in December. More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't drop any hints of raising rates in the March meet, placing the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group.In this case, high qualitydividend stockshave become more appealing as their stock prices don't suffer when rates aren't rising. Conversely, bond markets, which tend to benefit from a rise in interest rates, have lost its lure.Trump Stirs Up a TempestThe Fed's positive view of the economy and Apple Inc.'sAAPLstellar earnings helped stocks rally a little higher on Feb 1. However, investors have not yet recovered from the blow of Trump's immigration ban. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore should bode well for the equity market. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban.Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Tech firms also faced obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Trump's first press conference since July also disappointed investors due to lack of policy detail. He severely criticized pharmaceutical companies over high drug prices, dealing a blow to leading biotech stocks.Such uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are subject to gyrations. Notably, the month of February has traditionally seen weak numbers just after the election.February: Traditionally a Weak MonthFebruary has been the weakest month for stocks over the past four decades, averaging just a 0.06% gain. In fact, in post-election years, February tends to be weaker. The average return has decreased 1.85% since 1977.Lest we forget, markets have gone 74 days without a 1% daily decline, hence, the seasonality pattern increases the odds of a wider decline in February.Why Dividend Aristocrats? 5 Solid ChoicesDividend aristocrats outperform other dividend payers on better quality business. This category of stocks reflect a solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. Such stocks are immune to market vagaries and have also raked in excellent risk-adjusted returns over the last decade. In fact, in the last one year, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index rallied 19.6%, above the S&P 500's 17.5%.Dividend Aristocrats generated an annualized return of 9.7% over the past 10 years, easily topping the broader market's 6.3% rate. During this period, dividends accounted for 31% of the market's total return, highlighting their importance in determining total shareholder return.We have, thus, selected five such dividend aristocrats to boost your returns. Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks gain further this year as well.

Nokia Corporation (NOK) Q4 Earnings Beat, Decrease Y/Y;2/2/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Finland-basedNokia Corporation'sNOKfourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share of €0.12 (approximately 13 cents) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. In the year-ago period, Nokia had reported earnings of €0.15 (17 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year (on a comparable combined company basis) to €6.7 billion (approximately $7.1 billion). Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.38 billion. The disappointing performance by the Nokia Networks division was due to the challenging market conditions. Moreover, weak sales in Mobile Networks, which is part of Ultra Broadband Networks, contributed to the significant decline.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 42% in the reported quarter compared with 42.4% a year ago. Operating margin decreased 260 basis points (bps) to 14% on a year-over-year basis. In the fourth quarter, Nokia generated net cash from operating activities of €510 million as against €460 million at the end of 2015.Nokia is rapidly expanding in the field of technology and wireless infrastructure.

The segment includes Ultra Broadband Networks, and IP Networks and Applications. The decline in the Ultra Broadband Networks sub-group by 15% to €4,332 million hurt the segmental sales. The segment's sales also suffered due to a reduction of 12% to €1,976 million in net sales of the IP Networks and Application segment.Notably, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Middle East & Africa, which led to the segment's below-par performance. Net sales declined by 11% in North America,  30% in Latin America,  2% in the Asia Pacific, 33% in Greater China and  17% in Europe. Segmental gross margin improved 50 bps to 40.6% in the reported quarter.

3 Tech Stocks Paying Better Dividends Than Apple;2/2/2017;"Technology stocks, once the domain of high-flying growth investors, are becoming an increasingly generous source of dividends for income investors. The information technology sector led the market by total dividends paid both for the third quarter of 2016 and for the 12 months that ended September 30, according to a FactSet analysis of the 419 dividend payers in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple (symbolAAPL) was tops in the IT sector, paying $12.2 billion in dividends over the 12-month stretch.But just because Apple handed out the most money to its shareholders doesn't mean it's the best source of income in the sector. In fact, Apple's stock currently yields just 1.8%, even less than the S&P 500's 2.1%. So we set out to find mature tech stocks with solid business outlooks that offer superior yields to Apple. Our search turned up three blue-chip names. How blue? Like Apple, all three of our picks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Take a look.makeArticleAd();Cisco SystemsCisco Systems, which makes the routers, switches and modems that form the backbone of the internet, is poised for better-than-expected sales growth, analysts say. A recent survey of its customers by UBS Securities revealed that spending on Cisco products remains a top budgetary priority. The tech company gets good marks for being easy to work with, and two-thirds of respondents said it has the best overall security offering. The growth of cloud-based computing (storing data and applications on remote servers) and the Internet of Things (the expanding digital interconnectivity of everyday items, from cars to refrigerators) are long-term tailwinds for the company and the stock. UBS has a ""buy"" rating on Cisco shares.Analysts, on average, expect Cisco's earnings to rise by just a penny this fiscal year ending July 30, to $2.37 from $2.36, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Sales are forecast to slip 1.9% in fiscal 2017. The more bullish case for Cisco stems from projections for the following fiscal year (ending in July 2018), when profits are projected to climb 5% to $2.49 a share, and revenue is expected to gain 2.4%.Cisco's dividend, which dates back to 2011, has increased annually. The company disbursed $5 billion in common dividends for the 12 months ended Oct. 31. That was supported by $12 billion in free cash flow, or cash left over after spending the money required to operate and expand the business.SEE ALSO:10 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnIntelConsumers are increasingly forgoing desktop computers for mobile devices. As a result, PC sales have become a slowly melting iceberg. Market research firm Gartner found that PC sales fell for eight consecutive quarters as of the third quarter of 2016. That has forced Intel, the world's largest maker of the central processing units that serve as a PC's brain, to find new ways to generate revenue growth.The expansion of cloud-based services has been a boon to Intel, thanks to its market-share dominance in server chips. True, Intel faces changes in customer demands and competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but analysts at Stifel say it's responding well. ""Intel has been acquiring technologies and recruiting outside managerial talent to prepare for the changing market,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy, who rates Intel shares a ""buy,"" said in a recent note to clients.Analysts expect 2017 earnings to rise to $2.79 from $2.72 a share in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue is forecast to increase 1% to $60.1 billion. Intel paid its first cash dividend in 1992, and the company resumed annual dividend hikes two years ago. Intel's payout ratio, or dividends as a percentage of earnings, is a conservative 37% and below even the S&P 500's average ratio of 40%.SEE ALSO:3 Reasons to Own Apple Stock in RetirementMicrosoftMicrosoft is another tech company that's benefiting from the rise in cloud computing. An increasing number of customers now pay a recurring subscription fee to use its software rather than purchasing it outright. It's proving to be a hot area of growth. ""The closely watched commercial cloud business -- which includes Office 365, Azure and Dynamics 365 -- continued to grow at a torrid rate, reaching over $14.0 billion in annualized revenue in the second quarter [which ended December 31, 2016],"" William Blair & Co. analyst Jason Ader said in a recent note to clients.Importantly, the analyst expects Microsoft to become more profitable over time because of its ""disproportionate growth in its commercial cloud business, which is being boosted by rapid customer adoption of Office 365 and Azure."" Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, and Office 365 is the subscription version of its popular Office applications. Cloud-based services can have higher profit margins than traditional licensed software.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project earnings to rise to $2.97 a share for the current fiscal year ending June 30, from $2.79 in fiscal 2016. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is expected to increase 4.9% year over year, to $96.5 billion. For its second quarter, which ended December 31, Microsoft generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow after disbursing $3 billion worth of dividends. The company has paid a dividend to its shareholders since 2003. By contrast, Apple resumed paying a regular quarterly dividend only in 2012, following a 17-year layoff.SEE ALSO:10 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks for 2017"

Is Apple (AAPL) A Double From Here?;2/1/2017;"I talked yesterday about the Fed.  As I said, I think we'll find that the Fed will shift gears again to stay behind the curve on inflation, to let the economy run a little hot.  They met today and it was a non-event. They said nothing to build momentum on their rate hike from December.The news of the day has been Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings.  People over the past couple of years have been calling for the decline in Apple.  They've said it's topped.  They can't innovate in the post-Steve Jobs era.  The iPhone was magic. But reproducing magic isn’t easy.  Once you put a computer in everyone's pocket, there's not much more they can do to it with it. These are all of the quips about Apple's peak.  They may be right.  But Apple's peak, at least as a stock, is greatly exaggerated.They reported a huge positive surprise on earnings yesterday after the close.  The stock was up 6% on the day.  But even before that, I suspect it has become a much loved stock in the past two months in the ""smart money"" investor community.We should see in the coming weeks, as big investors disclose their positioning for the end of Q4, Apple will have returned to a lot of portfolios again.  Warren Buffett, an investor that has made his fortune buying when others are selling, built a big stake at the lows of the year last year.  And it's a perfect Buffett stock.It’s incredibly cheap compared to the market.The stock still trades at 15x earnings.  Much cheaper than the market.  Apple trades at 13x next year’s projected earnings.  The S&P 500 trades at 16.5x.  What about Apple's monster cash position?  Apple has even more cash now -- a record $246 billion. If we excluded the cash from the valuation, Apple market cap goes down from $675 billion to $429 billion.  That would equate to Apple trading at closer to 9x earnings. Though not an “apples to apples” that valuation would group Apple with the likes of these S&P 500 components that trade around 9 times earnings, like:  Dow Chemical, Prudential Financial, Bed Bath & Beyond, a Norwegian chemical company (LBY), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It's safe to say no one is debating whether or not Hewlett Packard is at the pinnacle of its business. Yet, if we strip out the cash in Apple, AAPL shares are trading closer to an HPE valuation.Add to that, Apple now has afresh catalystcoming in, Trump policies. The new President Trump is incentivizing Apple (and others) tobring offshore cash hoards back homewith a flat 10% tax.  And Apple makes money – a lot of it.  Acut in the corporate tax ratewill be a boon for earnings.  Two years ago, Carl Icahn argued that Apple should use (a lot more of) their cash to buyback shares – and, with that, valued the stock at double its current levels.makeArticleAd();For help building a high potential portfolio for 2017, follow me in ourBillionaire’s Portfolio, where you look over my shoulder as I follow the world’s best investors into their best stocks.

Apple, Inc. Earnings: 3 Answers From CEO Tim Cook;2/1/2017;"Ahead ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday,   investors were primarily looking for the company to show that it   can reverse its recent declining iPhone business. And Apple didexactly this, reporting 5% year-over-year growth in both iPhone unit and   revenue growth, helping the company's total revenue increase 3%   year over year. Even better, the company said it expected more   growth in its second quarter.But beyond Apple's financial performance, investors likely had   other questions on their minds -- questions more suitable for   management's earning call following the release. To this end, I   laid outthree questions Apple management would hopefully   addressduring the call. As it turns out, Apple management addressed all   three of these important topics.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's how Apple CEO Tim Cook and his management team answered   these three questions on Tuesday:1. How confident is management in its product pipeline?While the iPhone did return to growth in Apple's first   quarter, it was still relatively slow growth. The iPhone's   headwinds have put the pressure on the company to develop new   products to help accelerate growth. While investors obviously   shouldn't have expected Apple to spill the beans on anything   specific on Tuesday, Tim Cook did express confidence in the   company's pipeline of upcoming products.In Apple's first-quarter earnings press release, Cook said   Apple is ""very excited"" about the products in its pipeline. And   during Apple's earnings call, Cook showed even more enthusiasm,   saying, ""we've got some exciting things in the pipeline; I feel   really, really good about it.""2. What could Apple's services revenue growth look like going   forward?Services continue to grow in importance to Apple, and the   company's first quarter was no exception. Services revenue   climbed 18% year over year, growing to about 9% of total sales,   up from about 8% last year. And even this growth understates how   sharply the segment is climbing, as the company's services   segment benefited from a one-off $548 million patent-infringement   payment in the year-ago quarter.App Store sales are helping fuel services growth. Image     source: Apple.Going forward, Cook said (here's aReuters transcriptof the earnings call) that he expects services to become even   more integral to Apple's business:Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we     expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company     this year. Our services offerings are now driving over 150     million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own     services, and third-party content that we offer on our stores.     We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double     the size of our services business in the next four years.These expectations for Apple's services segment translate to a   forecast of about 20% annualized growth over the next four   years.3. If there's a tax break for repatriation, does Apple plan   to take advantage of it?With President Donald Trump saying he plans to offer a one-off   tax holiday for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas funds   at a lower tax rate, investors have good reason to be interested   in what Apple's CEO thinks of this. After all, of Apple's $246.1   billion in cash and marketable securities, an incredible $230.2   billion is outside of the United States.Fortunately, Cook talked about this potential holiday,   signaling he expected Apple to take full advantage:I am optimistic given what I'm hearing, that there would     likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem     like there's people in both parties that would favor a     repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for     the country and good for Apple.But Cook said investors will have to wait to see how   repatriated funds would be allocated:What we would do with it -- let's wait and see exactly what     it is -- but as I've said before, we are always looking at     acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the     last four years, and we look for companies of all sizes, and     there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size     of it. It's more about the strategic value of it.Beyond acquisitions, Apple could obviously allocate funds   toward other capital investments in its own business, a dividend   increase, a special dividend, share repurchases, or even all of   the above.While these were some of the more important topics covered   during the call, management also covered more details on the   company's services business, its regional results, the smartphone   market, and more.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today;2/1/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Stocks barely budged on Wednesday despite an interest rate   announcement by the Federal Reserve and a flood of fresh earnings   reports. Through all of that, theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) and theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) indexes each finished only marginally   higher.makeArticleAd();Today's stock market:IndexPercentage ChangePoint ChangeDow0.14%26.85S&P 5000.03%0.68Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Financial stocks and gold stocks saw elevated investor   attention on a day when the Federal Reserve decided to keep   long-term interest rates unchanged. Neither group broke far away   from broader market averages, though, and both theFinancial Sector SPDR Select ETF(NYSEMKT: XLF) and the leveragedDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT) were essentially unchanged.On the other hand, earnings season produced large price swings   in a few individual stocks, includingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andPitney Bowes(NYSE: PBI) .Apple returns to growthApple shares soared 7% to lead the Dow higher after the   company demonstrated that its growth days arefar from over. Revenue rose 3% following three consecutive quarters of   declines on strong demand for its latest iPhone models. Average   selling pricesjumpedthanks to a clear preference on the part of consumers for the   larger iPhone 7 Plus, and that success helped the company trounce   its earnings guidance.The tech titan generated $3.36 per share of profit compared to   expectations of $3.17 per share. ""We're thrilled to report that   our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly   revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,"" CEO Tim   Cook said in a press release.iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.Cook and his team drew attention to the company's booming   services business that includes iTunes and App Store purchases.   The segment passed $25 billion of revenue over the prior 12   months and is now responsible for nearly 10% of overall sales.   This quarter's gain was just below 20%, which suggests Apple has   a good shot at doubling services revenue by fiscal 2020.In the meantime, the company guided toward another quarter of   iPhone-led growth ahead, as revenue should come in at $52.5   billion while gross profit margin holds steady at just below 40%   of sales.Pitney Bowes misses expectationsPitney Bowes slumped 18% followingsurprisingly weak quarterly results. The office services specialist reported a 5% sales decline as   it produced adjusted earnings of $0.53 per share. Both the top-   and bottom-line figures were significantly lower than Wall Street   and management had forecast.""Our fourth quarter and full-year results were not what we   wanted or expected,"" CEO Marc Lautenbach said in a press release.   Executives were especially disappointed with their performance in   the software solutions business, which saw a 7% sales decline and   a 16% drop in operating earnings. The miss helped push revenue   down by 4% for the full year so that Pitney Bowes came in below   the lowered outlook it announced in early November.Looking ahead, management believes it has put most of the   sales disruptions, and a good portion of its restructuring   charges, behind it. However, Lautenbach and his team sounded a   similar tone three months ago when they pulled back their 2016   outlook after anespecially weak third quarter. Investors aren't keen to give the company much slack after two   consecutive outings headlined by disappointing operating results,   so the stock took a justifiable beating on Wednesday.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Silicon Laboratories Delivers Another Quarterly Beat;2/1/2017;"Silicon Laboratories(NASDAQ: SLAB) released stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter   2016 results Wednesday morning, driven by sustained momentum from   its Internet of Things segment. With shares now trading at fresh   all-time highs, let's take a closer look at the moving parts   behind the fabless-semiconductor specialist's business as it   heads into the new fiscal year.Silicon Laboratories' Thunderboard Sense is a complete     sensor-to-cloud kit for developers of all skill levels.

He elaborated: ""We are   executing on our strategy focused on the IoT and Infrastructure   markets and are seeing our efforts translate into strong   financial results, achieving target model for annual growth,   gross margin, and operating margin in the second half.""Looking forwardFor the first quarter of 2017, Silicon Labs anticipates   revenue of $174 million to $179 million, the midpoint of which   represents 8.9% year-over-year growth. On the bottom line,   Silicon Labs expects that performance to translate to adjusted   earnings per diluted share of between $0.57 and $0.63, up from   $0.51 per share in last year's first quarter. For   perspective -- and though we don't usually pay close attention to   Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts were less optimistic,   with consensus estimates calling fiscal first-quarter revenue and   earnings near the low ends of Silicon Labs' guidance ranges.Once again, Silicon Laboratories' relative outperformance was   evident this quarter, as it continues to capitalize on the   increasing ubiquity of connected devices. And even with shares   trading at all-time highs going into this report, it's no   surprise investors were willing to continue bidding up Silicon   Labs stock today.10 stocks we like better than Silicon   LaboratoriesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone 7 Plus Is a Smash Hit;2/1/2017;"The first quarter of anApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fiscal year is usually the company's peak quarter,   as it follows the launch of Apple's latest flagship iPhone   device. The iPhone generates the bulk of the company's revenue,   and so the quarter in which Apple sees the most iPhone shipments   is the quarter in which it sees its greatest revenue.Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Although there were rumors that Apple was seeing relatively   tepid demand for its latest iPhone models -- the iPhone 7 and the   iPhone 7 Plus -- the company's financial performance tells a   different tale.Apple reported shipping a record 78.29 million iPhones in the   first quarter, handily beating its previous quarterly record of   just shy of 75 million units. CEO Tim Cook said that it saw   ""exceptional demand"" for iPhones that ""beat [Apple's] own   internal expectations.""This robust unit demand didn't come at the expense of average   selling prices, either -- iPhone average selling prices in the   quarter came in at just a hair under $695.Just as the iPhone business is the star of the company's most   recent earnings report, the iPhone 7 Plus appears to be the star   of the iPhone business.iPhone 7 Plus is a smash hitCook said that the iPhone 7 is the company's ""most popular   model,"" but he highlighted the fact that the company saw   ""especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus.""Demand was so strong, in fact, that Cook says that the iPhone   7 Plus made up ""a higher portion of the new product mix than   [Apple has] ever seen with Plus models in the past.""To further drive the point home, even given the   stronger-than-expected unit shipment performance during the   quarter, Apple reported that ""demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded   supply throughout the quarter"" and that the company only ""came   into supply/demand balance in January.""And, finally, it's worth pointing out that Apple is seeing   this unexpectedly strong iPhone 7 Plus demand even though it   priced the devices at a $20 premium to where it had priced   previous iPhone Plus models (which previously carried $100   premiums over their non-Plus counterparts).Clearly, Apple's customer base likes what the company did with   the iPhone 7 Plus and was willing to pay a premium for the added   features.In the past, Apple had differentiated its Plus models with   larger, sharper displays as well as some very minor camera   enhancements (i.e., optical image stabilization). However, this   time around, in addition to the usual points of differentiation,   Apple included a dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus which   enabled an interesting optical zoom feature.The key lesson here is that if Apple brings interesting   innovations and features to premium products and tries to charge   a premium for those features, then it may very well get paid for   those features.Open sesameAt this point, it's obvious what Apple should do next --   introduce even higher-priced iPhones with even more interesting   features and points of differentiation. Apple shouldn't go wild   adding in every feature under the sun, but its product definition   and marketing teams should now have the freedom to go ahead and   build products with higher cost structures that are intended to   sell at higher price points.Such products, launched in conjunction with models priced at   the more ""typical"" price points, could be quite successful for   the company. In fact, current rumors suggest that Apple is   planning to launch two straightforward successors to this year's   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and then higher up in the product   stack, the company may launch an iPhone with a curved OLED   display and other goodies.If the upcoming OLED iPhone is a fundamentally compelling   product -- and I think it will be -- then I could see Apple   successfully charging even more for it than it does for its top   iPhone 7 Plus models.The next couple of years could be very interesting for Apple's   iPhone product line and, ultimately, its business!10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnce left for dead, semiconductor giantAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), has come back over the past two years, proving the doubters wrong. With gains of 400% over the past year, AMD stock haspunished those who bet against it. But is it now time to take profits?makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrNope.AMD stock had a slow start to 2017, off about 6% before Tuesday night's fourth-quarter earnings report, is back in the black thanks to a Wednesday surge after showing off some of the operational dominance it sported in a rip-roaring 2016.Expectation for the QuarterFor the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expected the company to report a loss of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.07 billion. AMD beat on both fronts, recording revenues of $1.11 billion and a loss of just 1 cent per share.Recent results fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) hinted that Advanced Micro might be in for a Street-beating quarter.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018On Friday John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest noted that Intel's results, which reflected less-bad personal computer trends, suggests strong growth for the sector. Notably, Vinh cited AMD as benefiting from ""strength in gaming and high-end PCs."" To that end, the analysts also said the improvements in high-end PCs could reduce concerns about high-end GPU inventory at desktop graphics card manufacturers.Well, a beat is what we got, and that came on the power of AMD's graphics chips, which saw revenues grow 15% year-over-year.The Key to AMD: GPUsGPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a big business for AMD. Those chips render images, animations and video for display on computer's screens. And the strength of that business has been a key component of AMD's turnaround. In the third quarter, reported in October, AMD posted a 23% year-over-year jump in revenue of $1.3 billion. The company benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line GPUs as revenue from that segment rose 11% year over year.This quarter, GPUs helped once more. Revenues in Computing and Graphics grew 28% year-over-year, thanks in part to higher average GPU selling prices.The company recently announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected byAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to power its cloud platform in 2017. All told, AMD's GPU strength has begun to gain traction in different verticals, which should help it narrow the market share gap with leaderNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Bottom Line for AMD StockAMD's report was full of other positives, such as an expansion of gross margins from 30% to 32%, and slight gains in its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business (4%).Still, graphics and high performance are the name of the game.AMD stock surged 14% higher on Wednesday's reaction to fourth-quarter results, putting shares at highs last seen in 2017. The stock has returned more than 400% in 12 months - better than the 20% one-year gain in theS&P 500.And even still, AMD is showing that there's little let-up in the growth ramp.I expect AMD stock to reach $13 in 2017, delivering 22% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising margins.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWill the Apple Inc.

Apple, Inc. Earnings: Why Shares Are Trading Higher;2/1/2017;"Following the company's first-quarter earnings report on   Tuesday, shares ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are up sharply on Wednesday. At the time of this   writing,Apple stockis trading at about $123, up more than 5% for the trading day.   The move helped the stock hit a new 52-week high. Apple stock's   move higher on Monday adds to the increasingly bullish sentiment   toward the stock recently. In the past six months, shares are up   about 23%, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 5% gain during   the same period.Investor optimism toward Apple stock recently is likely due to   a wide range of factors, including its conservative valuation,   speculation about a major redesign for Apple's expected iPhone   launch this fall, and Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7. But   one trend in Apple's business is likely serving as a primary   driver for the company's rising stock price: a rebound in iPhone   sales.iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Rebounding iPhone salesTo understand why recently rebounding iPhone sales are so   important to investors, it's important to realize how steeply   iPhone sales were declining on a year-over-year basis just a few   quarters ago.MetricQ3 2016Q2 2016iPhone unit sales growth (YOY)(15%)(16%)iPhone revenue growth (YOY)(23%)(18%)Total revenue (YOY)(15%)(13%)Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings   releases. Table by author.At the iPhone segment's worst point last year, unit sales and   revenue in the company's fiscal third quarter of 2016 declined   15% and 23%, respectively, dragging total revenue 15% lower   compared to the year-ago quarter. As Apple was reporting   significant year-over-year declines in its largest product   segment, investors were concerned about how the product segment   would perform over the longer term.But as early as Apple's fourth-quarter earnings report in   October, it was clear that the tech giant's iPhone business could   soon end a three-quarter streak of year-over-year declines in   total revenue. The company guided for first-quarter revenue to be   between $76 billion and $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the   year-ago quarter. Considering that iPhone accounts for over 60%   of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, this meant management was   optimistic about the company's new September-launched iPhone 7   and 7 Plus.Sure enough, iPhone sales rebounded.Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings     releases. Chart by author.Apple's first-quarter earnings release this week confirmed the   company's return to iPhone growth, with Apple reporting   year-over-year iPhone unit and revenue growth of 5%, helping the   company's total revenue rise 3%.Can iPhone growth persist?The big question going forward, of course, is whether Apple's   iPhone business can keep growing. In the near term, it looks like   management expects another quarter of growth. Apple said it   expected total second-quarter revenue to be between $51.5 billion   and $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.   With iPhone accounting for the bulk of Apple's total revenue,   this guidance for growth in total revenue likely means management   expects growth for the iPhone, too.Beyond Apple's second quarter, however, it's not as certain   that Apple's iPhone sales growth can be sustained throughout   fiscal 2017. However, a return to growth for iPhone 7 -- a   product with a three-year-old form factor -- is promising news,   highlighting how well the company's products continue to resonate   with customers.Combining Apple stock's conservative valuation with growth in   the company's biggest product segment, it's easy to see why   investors are optimistic about the stock's potential,   recently.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMoving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.FB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of itsmobile app.So where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneThe company is already a presence in video thanks toFacebook Live, which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has aPresidential endorsement.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatFB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing ""mid-roll"" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.Over time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.The problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.There is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.Netflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.Entering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly saidhe doesn't run a media company, that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.The Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhile most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front,hiring Campbell Brownto coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.What will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazon’s Alexa? (AAPL);2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhile there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.Here's how.Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKitApple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.It's that ""walled"" approach that hasmade the iPhone more securethan smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system.With the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over toHomeKit. Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!As pointed out in a recent Reuters article ondiffering smart home approaches, this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand whyApple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices. And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.That's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.That's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A ""Works with Alexa"" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityThe differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.Security is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.Amazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAll it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of thehacking risks for different smart home standards: ""Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.Before the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.Should hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Still Hobbling;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) is quintessentially Finnish - beautiful, rugged, quirky and a bit tragic. Once considered the preeminent mobile phone platform, its reign was challenged briefly byBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY), then permanently byApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Today, NOK stock is more than just a phone company, but will Wall Street care?makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings report is set for release before the opening bell on Feb. 2.Would-be buyers and traders have a tough call to make. We all love stories of the great comeback, and Nokia stock is a candidate. Shedding its legacy image as a boxy-cell-phone manufacturer, NOK stock has been extremely acquisitive.We're not just talking about the buyout ofAlcatel-Lucent, although that is a big part of the story. It's also the procurement of lesser known assets that will assert Nokia's new role as apublic networksprovider.At the same time, we're talking about NOK stock here. Recently,InvestorPlacecontributor Will Ashworth slammed Nokia stock as still being ""a dog with fleas,"" borrowing a line from the iconic movieWall Street.It's a fitting description of a company which has ""delivered a scintillating annualtotal returnover the past 15 years of -7.14%, more than 11 percentage points worse than theS&P 500.""7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Whatever management has up their sleeves, they better get to it. The markets are many things, but patient usually isn't one of them.The Nitty Gritty of Nokia EarningsLet's take a deeper look at the Nokia earnings. The average consensus estimate for earnings per share is 8 cents - smack in the middle of the forecast spectrum. For the top line, analysts are predicting sales to come in a range of $6.8 billion at the low to $7.6 billion at the high, with a $7.2 billion consensus.To say that the Nokia earnings environment is challenged is putting it mildly. First off, recent performances by NOK stock leave a lot to be desired. Fiscal 2016 is mostly a disappointment, with two misses and a narrow beat.Unless Nokia is planning to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat, I'm not sure what they can do. The financials for Nokia stock aren't exactly inspiring.Not surprisingly, Zacks Equity Research prospects for Nokia earnings are dim. Their analysts rank NOK stock as a ""sell,"" citing a litany of problems. Chief among them is the patent war that Nokia finds itself embroiled in with Apple. After losing the mobile phone business to Cupertino, NOK has devolved into whatInvestorPlacecontributor Dana Blankenhorn calls a""patent troll.""That's all fun and games when you pester from your home turf. But Nokia seemed to forget the first rule of trolling: don't troll those that can beat the crap out of you. Mighty Apple has had enough, and they're going to leverage their 22:1valuation disparityagainst Nokia.Again, as Blankenhorn states, that forces NOK stock into a weak hand.NOK Stock Is Wickedly UnpredictableClick to EnlargeStepping aside from the granularity of Nokia earnings, trading the shares based on its financial reports has a dubious history. Since Q4 of fiscal 2013, the average performance of Nokia stock quarter-to-quarter is a pretty sad -1.9%. Really, you just have to pull up the chart from the fall of 2014. It's just like ""Stairway to Heaven,"" only in the opposite direction.What that tells you is that if you do intend to trade Nokia earnings, do so quickly and firmly. Trying to make up for losses usually results in an extension of those losses. And the markets do not make it easy. In the last three reports, Nokia stock was positive heading towards the earnings release. On the day of, NOK fell to an average of 6%.Can GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Escape Its Bearish Dogma?For those who want to try their hand at a little Wall Street Russian roulette, a tip of the hat to you! For everybody else, I would just stay away from NOK stock. There are deep-seated fundamental challenges with the company that have yet to be adequately addressed.Until that day comes, Nokia stock remains a liability.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postNokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Still Hobblingappeared first onInvestorPlace."

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;2/1/2017;"When you regularly give your opinion on something as unpredictable as financial markets, gloating when you get something right is rarely a good idea. That is especially true when those opinions arearchivedfor all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’searnings release from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.That shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

"Apple, Inc. Earnings: Why the ""Most Accurate"" Apple Analyst Blew It";2/1/2017;"On Tuesday afternoon,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted strong earnings results for the first   quarter of its 2017 fiscal year. Revenue beat analysts' forecasts   and the company's own guidance range. Earnings per share   comfortably beat the average analyst estimate as well. Finally,   iPhone sales rose 5% year over year, to 78.3 million units; most   analysts had been expecting a smaller increase -- or even a   decline.Apple posted strong iPhone sales for the critical holiday     quarter. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();One of those analysts wrongly expecting an iPhone sales   decline was Ming-Chi Kuo of Taiwan's KGI Securities. In the past   few years, Kuo has gained a reputation among many investors for   being the ""most accurate Apple analyst."" The fact that he whiffed so badly on his iPhone sales forecast   is an important reminder to investors not to rely too much on   analysts' forecasts.Understanding the ""most accurate"" Apple analystMing-Chi Kuo has very good sources -- either in Apple's supply   chain or at the company itself -- giving him advance warning of   new product features and production plans. He isn't perfect, but   he's one of the best sources out there for news about Apple's   future products.Ming-Chi Kuo correctly predicted many features of the iPhone     7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.For example, Kuocorrectly predictedmost of the key features of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prior   to those models being officially unveiled last September. That   included obscure details like the fact that there wouldn't be   32GB versions of the new jet black iPhones.Kuo also has a pretty good track record for short-term   shipment forecasts. A few days before Apple's Q1 earnings report   two years ago, he predicted that Apple had sold 73 million   iPhones during the holiday quarter, when most analysts still   expected a shipment number well below 70 million. In fact, Apple   reported that it had shipped 74.5 million iPhones.However, Kuo's competitive advantage appears to be limited to   picking up supply chain rumors. When it comes to estimating   demand for Apple's products, his record is far less pristine.Underestimating iPhone sales by a mileFor the past several months, Ming-Chi Kuo had stuck to a   forecast that Apple would ship 70 million-75 million iPhones in   the first quarter. At the midpoint of that range, iPhone sales   would have been down 3% year over year, whereas iPhone sales   actuallyincreased5%.This doesn't fully capture how far off Kuo's expectations   were, though. Prior to late September, he had expected Apple to   ship just 65 million iPhones in Q1, down 13% year over year.The further you zoom out, the worse Kuo's predictions have   been. Back in April, he stated that in a best-case scenario,   Apple would ship 205 million iPhones for the full 2016 calendar   year. (His worst-case scenario was 190 million shipments.) Apple   actually shipped 215.4 million iPhones for the full year.Don't trust analysts too muchInvestors who soldApple stocklast year -- or decided not to buy it -- based on Kuo's   relatively bearish projections have missed out on a big rally.   Since bottoming out around $90 last May, Apple stock has come   roaring back, reaching $125 in after-hours trading on Tuesday   afternoon. This shows the danger of relying too much on analysts'   forecasts.Apple Stock Performance, data byYCharts.Following top analysts for a stock you own is a good way to   stay up to date on the latest trends and the general outlook for   the next few quarters. However, while Wall Street analysts may in   theory be the ""experts,"" even the best ones can make some big   mistakes. For individual investors, it's important to understand   when to trust an analyst's predictions.For Apple, Ming-Chi Kuo is an important analyst to follow for   learning about potential new products and early production plans,   because of his supply chain connections. However, Apple's sales   results ultimately depend on demand.Being plugged in to the supply chain doesn't help much in   forecasting demand. Perhaps Kuo can accurately estimate how many   components Apple's suppliers are building. That shows how many   devices Apple plans to build -- and, by extension, how much   demand Apple expects to see. But build plans are fluid and   routinely change based on actual demand.Thus, while Kuo is great at calling the play-by-play of what   Apple is doing now, his analysis is less reliable looking further   into the future. Investors who have followed his advice over the   past several quarters just learned that lesson the hard way.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Advanced Micro (AMD) Q4 Loss In Line, View Disappoints;2/1/2017;"Advanced Micro DevicesAMDreported loss of 4 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2016, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues increased 15.4% year over year to $1.11 billion primarily driven by higher GPU sales. However, revenues decreased 15.4% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally soft sales figures for its semi-custom System on Chips (SoCs). Notably, revenues were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion.AMD's shares rose 1.2% in after-hour trading. We note that shares have outperformed the ZacksElectronics Semiconductorsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gave a positive return of 67.2%, AMD gained a whopping 384.6%.The company benefited from strong demand for its graphics products. However, AMD's first-quarter 2017 will be impacted by seasonal weakness.RevenuesAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments -Computing and Graphics(focused on the traditional PC market) andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom(focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). The details of these segments are discussed below:Computing and Graphics includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics. This segment accounted for 54.2% of revenues and was up 27.1% sequentially and 27.7% year over year to $600 million.Notably, this segment's revenues grew on an annualized basis for the first time since 2011 as AMD's increased efforts to strengthen this particular segment paid off.Also, the segment posted the highest revenue in the last two years. Client revenues were the highest in the last seven quarters. Graphics processor revenues were also the highest in the last 11 quarters.During the reported quarter, strong adoption of the company's seventh generation notebook accelerated processing units (APUs) drove growth for the company. While desktop processor sales improved on a sequential basis, it declined on a year-over-year basis.The company also won a number of high-end design deals with global original equipment manufacturers over its Ryzen desktop processor that is expected to be launched in early Mar 2017.AMD's Polaris line of GPUs witnessed increased adoption in the fourth quarter. Also, Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs were launched, which are used in Apple'sAAPLpremium segment notebooks.The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. This segment brought in the remaining 45.8% of revenues, down 39.4% sequentially but up 3.7% year over year to $506 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales of embedded processor sales and game consoles by MicrosoftMSFTand Sony that are powered by AMD's chips.The segment witnessed increased adoption in targeted markets. Notably, the company continues to gain traction in Naples, Italy.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteOperating ResultsNon-GAAP gross margin (excluding Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) charges) was 31.7%, which expanded a whopping 494% sequentially but only 24% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating expenses of $354 million increased 0.6% sequentially and 6.6% year over year.Non-GAAP operating loss was $3 million compared with a loss of $49 million in the year-ago quarter and loss of $293 million in the previous quarter.Mentor Graphics PartnershipAdvanced Micro's recent strategic partnership with Mentor Graphics on embedded technology will offer more choice to embedded developers in the x86 architecture high-performance computing segment. As more and more devices become interconnected, Advanced Micro's efforts to further strengthen its position in the burgeoning embedded markets will reap benefits. (Read:AMD and Mentor Graphics Ink Deal on Embedded Technology).Google DealIn November, the company announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected by AlphabetGOOGLto power its cloud platform in 2017. These developments are expected to help the company gain more traction in the GPU space and close in the market share gap with NVIDIA. (Read:AdvancedMicro Scales New Highs, Clinches Deal with Google).Balance SheetAdvanced Micro exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $1.26 billion, up $6 million from the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, before issuance costs, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock and $700 million of Convertible Notes due 2026.Inventory was $751 million, up 10.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 2.7% sequentially. Total debt (short term and long term) was $1.43 billion, down $0.2 billion sequentially.GuidanceManagement expects first-quarter 2017 revenues to decrease 11% sequentially (+/- 3%), primarily due to seasonal weakness in semi-custom and graphics products. If the company manages to achieve the mid-point of its guidance, it will translate to 18% growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin is likely to be 33% while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $360 million.On the other hand, interest expense, taxes and others will amount to $30 million. Inventories are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Our TakeThe decent fourth-quarter results reflected AMD's improving position in key markets with the introduction of several APUs and GPUs. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Google for the supply of Radeon Pro GPUs and FirePro server GPUs are positive in our view.Notably the company trails NVIDIA as the second-largest manufacturer of graphics chips for high-end computing and is gradually gaining traction in the space.Additionally, upcoming products like Ryzen and Zen are expected to drive the top line going ahead.Zacks RankAdvanced Micro has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs it's customary withAmgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), the biotech giant topped analysts' expectation in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Chances are that it'll top expectations once more when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 figures on Feb. 2. So if you're following AMGN stock, you don't need to worry about Amgen's profits.makeArticleAd();Source:Richard Masoner via FlickrInstead, you'll want to watch the following items Thursday when Amgen reports its fourth-quarter results:#1: Enbrel Sales TrendCompared to the third quarter of 2015, Amgen reported flat product sales in Q3 2016. This was mostly due to its top-selling drug, Enbrel, losing ground. Sales for the drug had increased 24% in Q1 and 10% in Q2, but in the third quarter, total Enbrel sales were $1.452 billion, versus $1.459 billion in the year-ago period.The problem doesn't seem to be seasonal fluctuation, considering that Enbrel sales grew by 30% in Q3 2015, compared to Q3 2014.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayThe problem is that competition is catching up. Amgen usually says, ""offset partially by the impact of competition"" when giving details about Enbrel sales. However, in Q3 2016, ""partially"" was conspicuously absent. Did someone just forget to copy-and-paste? Maybe. Maybe not.AMGN stock holders should pay attention to see if Enbrel will resume growth through increased volume, as opposed to price hike.Enbrel faces three major growth barriers.First, it competes againstAbbVie Inc's(NYSE:ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade. This leads to the second challenge.Stiff competition necessitates incremental rebates to payers to maintain its formulary position.The third challenge is the biosimilar availability. For instance, the FDA has approved Erelzi, an Enbrel biosimilar byNovartis AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).Put simply, further lackluster Enbrel growth would weigh on AMGN stock.#2: Amgen's Drug PricingInvestors also should look closely at how fast Amgen is hiking prices.I raised concerns about Amgen stockgrowing sales by increasing drug prices, instead of higher volumes, after the company reported its Q2 2015 earnings. Almost two years on, the trend of growing sales with price hikes is still commonplace at AMGN.From a business perspective, it's smart to try to squeeze out every possible dollar from your inventions. However, the U.S. government is standing up against it. President Donald Trump told drugmakers in aJan. 31 meetingthat ""we have to get the prices down.""This won't be good for the top and bottom lines of any drugmaker. However, for a company who thrives on hiking drug prices like AMGN, the downside gets bigger.#3: How Did Repatha Perform?Repatha is heralded as potentially one of Amgen's best sellers. The company said the drug caters to ""serious diseases with significant unmet needs."" However, it brought in a meager $40 million in Q3.One barrier to market growth is that payers have employed utilization-management procedures, which limited patients' ability to gain access to Repatha. Execs said during Q3 earnings call that they're working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. Investors should look to see if collaborations with payers and providers are yielding significant Repatha growth.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I KnowThe drug, which currently competes withSanofiSA (ADR)(NYSE:SNY) andRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's(NASDAQ:REGN) Praluent, had a 55% share of new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx) in Q4, according to an Amgen presentation at this year's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Still, AMGN stock holders probably want to know just how much in sales that amounted to.But it has to be noted that an ongoing court case that Amgen filed against Sanofi and Regeneron onpatent infringementgrounds is tipping the scale in Rapatha's favor for now.Finally, investors should pay attention to see if low expenses is continuing and will continue at Amgen. Since the beginning of 2015, AMGN has reduced its total expenses by roughly 3.7% to 13.22%. Keeping expenses low will be critical to future profitability, especially in Trump's recent focus on drugmakers.Earnings apart, I believe the uncertainties surrounding the future make AMGN stock less attractive.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Stock Market News for February 01, 2017;2/1/2017;"U.S. stocks ended mostly lower on Tuesday amid signs that momentum following President Donald Trump's election victory in November was fading. His signing of an executive order to temporary restrict immigration saw weekend chaos and backlash, eventually affecting stocks. Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years. Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013, while the Nasdaq ended in the green on Tuesday thanks to sharp gains in biotech stocks.makeArticleAd();For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.5% or 107.04 points, to close at 19,864.09, with 22 of the 30 blue-chip companies closing lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,278.87, with six of the 11 main sectors finishing in negative territory. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,614.79, gaining a meagre 0.02%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 1.7% to settle at 11.68. A total of around 4.08 billion shares were traded on the NYSE on Tuesday.Political Concern WeighsMarket bulls argue that Trump's business-friendly policy focused on tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, remains a positive for the economy, but, investors were put to notice on Tuesday that the path higher might no longer be so smooth.Investors' grappled over Trump's executive order to tighten immigration rules. The order would temporarily ban immigration into the U.S. from Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens, while it also seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. Such an executive order spawned legal challenges, congressional criticism and widespread protests.The market rally that catapulted the Dow over 20000 last week has stalled, with investors backing away from shares of industrial and financial companies and picking up havens like gold. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.The Nasdaq, however, finished in positive territory due to gains in biotech stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology index (IBB) rallied 2.8% (read more:Drug Stocks Rally on Trump Meet with Pharma Bigwigs).Monthly GainsThe main indexes posted a third consecutive round of monthly gains in January. The Dow added 0.5% for the month, the S&P 500 was 1.8% higher and the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.3%. Projections for stronger economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings boosted US stocks for the first January rise in five years. Stocks rallied on hopes that the new administration's policies including lowering of taxes and cutting regulations will bolster economic growth.The materials sector has fueled the rally, advancing 5.1% so far this year, following a 14% gain in 2016. Companies listed on the sector have benefited from Trump's infrastructure spending promises and a rise in the price of many raw materials. Technology shares that trailed behind the broader market last year have also recorded sharp gains this year. The sector has risen 3.6% in January, its best month since last July.Earnings in the final quarter of 2016 came on the heels of growth in the third quarter that snapped a 15-month decline in earnings.

Apple, Inc. Can Still Set Records;2/1/2017;"Image source: Apple.It's been a while sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted a bona fide blowout quarter, but I think   it's safe to say that last quarter qualifies.makeArticleAd();The Mac maker set an all-time record high with quarterly   revenue, which came in at $78.4 billion. That's a few billion   higher than the $75.9 billion in sales that Apple generated a   year ago, and above the high end of Apple's own guidance ($78   billion). Naturally, that was driven by strong iPhone sales,   another record at 78.3 million. This all comes as the iPhone 7   was arguably the most incremental model update in years, keeping   the same overall industrial design with no clear must-have   feature. Combined with the perennial supply constraints, it's   rather impressive that the company was able to move that many   smartphones.Other quarterly records set in Q4 were earnings per share   ($3.36), services revenue ($7.2 billion), Mac revenue ($7.2   billion), Apple Watch units (who knows?!), and Apple Watch   revenue (your guess is as good as mine). Four out of Apple's five   geographical operating segments also set fresh highs (all but   Greater China). That's what I call comprehensive performance.Two cameras are better than oneAs usual, the iPhone was the star of the show, comprising   nearly 70% of sales. While sales were up 5%, sell-through was up   8% thanks to robust demand. In line with CFO Luca Maestri'sprediction in October, average selling prices (ASPs) bounced back sequentially with a   vengeance. ASPs were depressed for a few quarters in 2016   following the launch of the $400 iPhone SE, but have now   rebounded to $695 -- pretty comparable to last year's $691.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.This tells investors a few things, some obvious and others   less so. Clearly, the iPhone 7 Plus is a hit, likely due to the   dual-camera system that is the most notable differentiating   feature. On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted that the mix   was skewed toward the Plus models more than in any prior cycle   (this is the third year that Apple has had Plus models with   5.5-inch displays). Cook even acknowledged later in the call that   Apple did not predict iPhone 7 Plus demand very well, which   adversely affected production plans.Additionally, Apple finally increased the entry-level storage   to 32 GB in 2016, at long last addressing an increasingly   prominent customer complaint. The financial risk to that move was   removing the upsell incentive, and the $100 to $200 that goes   with it. If 32 GB of storage is sufficient, a larger proportion   of customers may opt for the base model instead of upgrading; 16   GB has long been woefully insufficient, virtually assuring strong   upgrade activity. The good news is that Apple has maintained a   relatively comparable mix of upgrades, as evidenced by the strong   ASP.Macs and iPadsThe fact that Mac revenue hit a new all-time high shows that   Apple still has tricks up its sleeve. We're talking about a   business that's over 40 years old, after all. The new MacBook   Pros with Touch Bar were significantly constrained during the   quarter, but the related price increase appears to have been able   to help Mac ASPs by quite a bit. Mac ASPs jumped sequentially   from $1,175 to $1,348; this is the first time in nearly three   years that this figure was above $1,300.There wasn't a whole lot of news on the iPad front, in part   because Apple didn't update its tablet lineup in the fall. Apple   sold 13.1 million units, down 19% from a year ago. iPad revenue   fell more than that due to declining ASPs ($423). The more   affordable iPads continue to prove rather popular. Cook said the   company has some exciting things in the pipeline for iPad,   potentially referring to the rumors around other display sizes or   the Apple Pencil 2.Services to $50 billionApple's services business has just officially become a $25   billion business on a trailing-12-month basis. Management   ambitiously hopes todoublethis business within the next four years, targeting $50 billion   in annual revenue in 2020. That's an aggressive goal, but also in   line with the company's efforts to shift investor attention   toward recurring revenue sources.CFO Luca Maestri noted that the App Store continues to be the   main driver of growth, thanks to increased buying activity within   the installed based as well as new users coming to the platform.   The music business, including both downloads and streaming, has   started growing again over the past three quarters. iCloud   storage upsells are also growing ""very quickly,"" as is AppleCare.   Simply put, the plethora of services that Apple offers are all   faring well.Wrapping upShare repurchases came in at $11 billion, which included $5   billion in open market purchases and a $6 billion accelerated   share repurchase (ASR) program. That's the ninth ASR for those   keeping score at home. The company retired 65.3 million shares   during the quarter thanks to these aggressive repurchases, which   contributed to the record EPS due to its accretive effects.That puts cumulative share repurchases at $143.7 billion out   of the current $175 billion authorization. Apple updates its   capital return program every spring, typically alongside its   April earnings release. There's plenty of room to accommodate   Apple's typical level of repurchases, and investors can look   forward to an update next quarter.In terms of fundamentals, the results were a blowout. Investor   reaction, on the other hand, is another topic. Shares jumped over   4% in extended trading, and Apple hasn't traded around $125 since   mid-2015. I still have doubts about Apple enjoying any semblance   of multiple expansion, but the business is as strong as ever.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Since the truth usually lies somewhere in between, the premium I collect from them expires worthless and for maximum gains.Click to EnlargeCurrently, I see technical things I like about CMG stock. I can argue that if it is able to add a few bucks from its current level, it could mount a challenge to $450 per share. But instead of betting on that fact, today I want to sell risk against a level low enough that it should hold through the summer season.It is important to recognize that earnings are coming soon and those can be brutal in the short term.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryIt is even more important to remember that I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.CMG Stock Trade IdeasThe Trade:Sell CMG Jun $315 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3.20 per contract to open. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 24% buffer from current price.By selling CMG put, I commit to buying the stock at that price if Chipotle stock falls through it by June. If so then I would have bought the stock at a 25% discount from current levels and where CMG has had strong consolidation during 2011/2012. 23% sounds like a big enough buffer, but earnings reactions are unpredictable, so I have to be realistic in my expectations.Still, selling naked puts is not suited for everyone. I can modify the trade to better fit more conservative risk profiles.The Alternate:Sell CMG Jun $320/$315 credit put spread. This also is a bullish trade, but one that has a finite risk profile. I collect 50 cents per contract to open. This has a 23% buffer from current price. If successful, this trade yields 10% on money risked.Apple Inc.

ADP Private-Sector Jobs Hit 246K, Way Above Estimates;2/1/2017;"Wednesday, February 1, 2017makeArticleAd();Payroll processing giant ADPADPhas released its January private sector jobs report before the bell this morning, posting a far-better-than-expected 246K new jobs for the month. Consensus expectations had been for 164K. December's total was revised downward by 2000 jobs to 151K, which is the range in which the U.S. labor market had been settling prior to this morning's number.The Services group still rules the roost, with 201K new January jobs in the private sector, whereas Goods brought in 46K. Manufacturing and Mining totals, while not incredibly strong, at least have swung to the positive - 15K and 6K, respectively. Healthcare put up a strong 49K, but the top two sectors were in Professional/Business Services at 71K and Trade/Transportation/Utilities at 63K.Good weather in January can likely take some of this credit. Medium-sized companies (between 50-499 employees) brought in the lion's share with 102K, followed by large companies (500+ employees) at 83K, with Small firms (under 50) picking up the remaining 62K. For years, at least seemingly, it had been small-business hiring which had kept the labor market strong. This looks to be shifting.The ADP report serves as somewhat of a forward indicator toward the monthly non-farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which also includes Government jobs and will be released Friday. However, the analyst consensus for the BLS total is 174K as of now, down considerably from today's private-sector results. Historically, the ADP and BLS numbers don't always gibe in the near-term, but upon revisions in future months they tend to track each other pretty consistently.What some economists predict going forward, though, is a labor market that shows increasing difficulties with filling open job positions. This is part of what it means to have an Unemployment rate at around 4.7%. This results in wage growth picking up, which we've also seen some evidence of lately. So the potential problems with finding employees with the skill-sets to fill certain positions - which may be exacerbated by the Trump administration's rather draconian policies regarding immigration reform, in that immigrants traditionally absorb many jobs on the lower levels of the pay-scale - may manifest in a stagnating labor market going forward.Earnings UpdateAppleAAPLput up Q1 2017 earnings numbers after the bell that were reminiscent of the tech giant's late-era Steve Jobs years, blowing the doors off expectations for iPhone sales in the quarter.

Apple Just Showed the Mac Is Back - What Does It Mean For PCs?;2/1/2017;"Apple's (AAPL) fiscal first-quarter results came in better-than-expected, thanks in part to strong iPhone sales. However, it's the noticeable growth in the Mac unit that has caught investors' eyes.During the period, Applesold5.374 million Macs, generating $7.244 billion in revenue. That’s a 1% year over year increase in units and more importantly, a 7% increase in revenue. It shows that despite all the media criticism about the new MacBook Pro with the TouchBar, Apple’s products are resonating with the market.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said the Mac sales came in well above his 4.74 million unit projection.makeArticleAd();The results helped Apple return to growth, something that's been nipping at the heels of Apple and its investors for some time.Couple this fact, along withstrong fourth-quarter resultsfrom Intel and its Client Computing unit and it looks like PC sales, which have been in decline for so long, are finally returning to some semblance of normalcy.Intel, which reported earnings last week, saw strength from its next-generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Credit Suisse analysts, led by John Pitzer noted, ""[Original design manufacturers] attributed better than expected builds to the introduction of INTC's next-gen Kaby Lake CPUs, VR-ready NBs and MacBooks, and stronger than expected demand at US [original equipment manufacturers].""Research firm Gartner noted fourth-quarter PC shipments totaled 72.6 million, down 3.7% year-over-year. However, Apple's continued push into the enterprise helped it, as there was a refresh in the business community, in addition to strength in the gaming market.For years, the PC market has been in a sharp decline and while Gartner's figures show an industry still in decline, the decline is moderating. With Apple's essentially flat unit growth, that means it's taking market share, as well as profit share, something that bodes well for Apple and its shareholders.Click to see original TweetThe broader PC market is likely never return to the growth of the 1990's, thanks in part to mobile devices. And while strong, the influx of subsets like gaming PCs are too small to boost the overall market.However, with Apple's latest innovations to its Mac lineup (and more tocome, per CEO Tim Cook) and the rise of niche PC markets, the sector is no longer an albatross area for investors."
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I Know;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDisruption is everywhere.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) disrupts how we shop, whileAirbnbdisrupts where we stay.Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) disrupts what we drive, andUbereven disruptswhetherwe drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming … or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above:Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSimply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know.Let me explain.Silicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for myBullseye Brief, one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.Innovation LeadersCuriously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I'll bet on GOOGL.MoonshotMuch of Google's innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It's run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend hisTED Talkexplaining how Google X approaches innovation:Identify a problem affecting millions of people.Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.Move full speed ahead if there's reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.He says Google X people spend most of their time ""breaking things and trying to prove they're wrong"" but believes that's their secret … what makes Googlers different. By ""killing"" more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development - the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.R&D as % of RevenueAlphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories - like robotics and AI- and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.There's no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.What's GOOGL Stock Worth?Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?I like to compare the growth we're getting (earnings) with the price we're paying (price-to-earnings, or P/E). This is called a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it's an intuitive way to compare apples to apples.Using 2017 consensus estimates tracked by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tucked right in the middle of the pack. Its PEG ratio is 1.08. PEGs below 1 are cheap, and PEGs approaching 2 are expensive.PEG ratios are revealing.First of all, no one should buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). It's neither a growth stock nor a value play.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is a tad expensive, but not excessively so, especially since many consider ittheChinese consumer trading vehicle.Amazon is attractive, so areApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), both of which I have written up as longs and currently own.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), I admit is a mystery. It'ssocheap. I can only surmise its limited German and S. Korean listings deter U.S. investors, as does the $1,700 stock price. It needs to split at least 10-to-1.The TradeSell the GOOGL April $800 puts at $20 to initiate a long-biased position.If the stock pulls back and trades through the $800 strike price, I'm assigned shares and become a buyer. If Google continues making new highs, I pocket the premium. I am content either way. Google's chart indicates initial technical support around $780, and significant long-term support $700-$725.The reason I'm selling puts rather than buying the stock is because GOOGL stock has recently risen to a new all-time high. I know new highs tend to beget new highs (momentum traders buy strength), but I'm a value buyer at heart.Adam Johnson is Founder and Author ofBullseye Brief, an investment newsletter that presents thematic and actionable ideas.

(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) put an old-school beat-down on Q1 2017 estimates from the Zacks consensus: $3.36 per share on sales of $78.4 billion easily topped the #3.22 per share and $76.93 billion expected. iPhone sales totaled 78.3 million in the quarter, ahead of the 77.3 million in the company's unit guidance. Gross margins came in-line with expectations at 38.5%.Importantly, the company has finally ended its string of decreasing revenue and unit growth.

Revenues of $2.07 billion beat the Zacks consensus estimate of $2.06 billion. The after-market has been trying to sort these difficulties, first trading down 1% on the news, whereas the stock has now swung into positive territory in the late session.The debut earnings report for Arconic (NYSE:ARNC-Free Report) since the split from Alcoa (NYSE:AA-Free Report) was positive, if unspectacular. Earnings of 12 cents per share on quarterly sales of$2.97 billion beat the Zacks consensus estimates of 11 cents and $2.92 billion in revenues.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the bell, and it kicked the year off the right way. Apple set an all-time quarterly revenue record - snapping its streak of declines - and broke its previous iPhone sales record. AAPL stock is up strongly Wednesday morning as a result.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut the star of yesterday's show wasn't the iPhone. It was the Services division, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, AppleCare and Apple Music. Services didn't just set another record - it also posted the strongest year-over-year growth of any AAPL division.Services Is on Fire, Led by the App StoreApple reported that the quarterly revenue for its Services division topped $7.17 billion for Q1, an increase of 18% compared to the previous year. If that sounds like a lot of money for what is largely made up of mobile payment transaction fees and digital content, it is. In comparison,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) experienced its largest-ever subscriber growth in the final quarter of 2016, leading it to post revenue of $2.48 billion.During the AAPL earnings conference call, CEO Tim Cook noted that he expects the Services division to bethe size of a Fortune 100 company by the end of the year. Other key information about the Services division from that earnings call includes:App Store revenue for December alone was a record-setting $3 billionThere are now 2.2 million apps in the App Store, and AAPL paid out over $20 billion to developers in 2016The number of Apple Pay users has tripled over the past year, with transaction volume up over 500% year-over-yearAppleCare and storage services (iCloud) both set all-time recordsApple's music business grew for the third straight quarterWhy Services Revenue is ImportantYou might not know it based on Apple's record-setting iPhone sales this quarter, but selling hardware is tough.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryOnce a consumer has an iPhone in his or her hands, it becomes very difficult to convince them to spend a minimum $649 to ditch that smartphone for a new one. In one sense, a huge installed user base - which AAPL has, withmore than 1 billion iOS devices in active use- works against the company. When the iPhone first began to take off, AAPL was selling to people who'd never owned one before. Now, that pool of easy sales is dwindling. And Apple is left in the tougher position of convincing its installed user base to upgrade.Thus the hand-wringing about slowing iPhone sales.Apple's Services division largely benefits from that huge installed user base, though. True, AAPL only gets one shot at selling these customers AppleCare. But once they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Apple Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explore Apple's other services. They are increasingly adopting Apple Pay. They are in a prime position to buy movies on their Apple TV. They are perfect candidates to subscribe to Apple Music. There are plenty of hooks for storing data on iCloud. And of course, there is the App Store and the lure of its millions of apps.Apple's Services revenue doesn't come in big chunks like selling an iPhone. It's $9.99 a month here, 99 cents for an app there, a few cents for a transaction. But it adds up, especially when over a billion customers are generating it.More importantly, that revenue doesn't drop off the same way hardware revenue does when people stop buying new iPhones.Some services - like iCloud and Apple Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keeps automatically billing the customer's card every month regardless of whether their iPhone is brand new or five years old. Apple Pay revenues are increasing as more countries and businesses accept it and iPhone owners grow more accustomed to using it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeople never stop buying apps. They may slow down after the initial rush of a new device, but developers keep bring enticing new games and other apps to the App Store. That means the 1 billion users continue to download.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunJust look at the 40 million-plusSuper Mario Rundownloads from the App Storein only four days.How many iPhones will AAPL sell two years from now? No one knows for sure, but odds are it won't be many more than it does now. On the other hand, Apple is confident its highflying App Store, Apple Pay and other services will see Services division revenue double in that time.The iPhone may have driven Apple stock growth over the past decade. But Services revenue is increasingly important as AAPL stock searches for that elusive next hardware hit.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatCan Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?The Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe postApple Inc.

The figure marked a 3.3% rise year-over-year.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe strong statistic was fueled in part by Apple's iPhone 7 sales, which were especially strong, topping the total from the previous month. The company sold 78.29 million iPhones in its fourth quarter.The figure was nearly 5% higher than the previous year, or about 4 million more than it sold in 2015's fourth quarter. The company's iPhone business makes up about 69% of its revenue for the quarter.iPad sales were weaker for Apple to end fiscal 2016, falling by 22% to $5.5 billion, which suggests that the newer iPad Pro models are not as hot as the company hoped they would be.Mac computers were 7% higher over the same quarter of 2015, amounting to $7.24 billion.AAPL stock boomed 3% after hours.Electronic Arts Inc.

Apple, Inc.'s Record Quarter Returns the Company to Growth;2/1/2017;"After market on closed on Tuesday, tech giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) put to rest any doubts about the company's ability   to post strong holiday results. Shares moved a few percentage   points higher immediately after the company released its figures   for its Dec. 31-ending first fiscal quarter of 2017. Apple's   revenue and earnings exceeded both management's own forecast for   the quarter and analysts' consensus estimate.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's a look at some of the biggest takeaways from the   results.Financial resultsMetricQ1 2017Q1 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$78.4 billion$75.9 billion3.3%Earnings per share$3.36$3.282.4%Gross profit margin38.5%$40.1%(160 basis points)Data source: AppleQ1 2017 press release. Table by author.Apple's revenue reached an all-time high of $78.4 billion, up   3.3% from the year-ago quarter and above the company's guidance   for $76 billion to $78 billion. In addition, Apple's EPS of $3.28   easily exceeded the midpoint of its guidance range for about   $3.17.Segment resultsThe iPhone remained crucial to Apple's overall results,   accounting for nearly 70% of total revenue during the quarter.   With a 5% year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, the product   segment played a key role in Apple's better-than-expected   financial results.But the tech giant's services segment, which accounts for   sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay,   licensing, and other services, was also important. Services   revenue was up 18% year over year, accounting for 9.1% of the   quarter's total results -- up from 8% in the year-ago quarter.   Apple CEO Tim Cook commented specifically on Apple's services   segment performance, saying the growth was ""led by customer   activity on the App Store.""Data source: Apple Q1 2017 press release. Chart by     author.Another bright spot from Apple's segment results was Mac. With   the help of its new MacBook Pro, the segment's revenue increased   7% year over year.However, not all of Apple's product segments were on the rise   during the quarter. Apple's iPad revenue continued its downward   trend, with revenue falling 22% year over year. Other products   revenue, which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats   products, iPod, and accessories, saw its revenue decline 8% year   over year. But Apple was careful to note in its first-quarter   press release that despite the decline in other products revenue,   Apple Watch revenue hit an all-time high.GuidanceApple also notably said it expects revenue growth to continue   in the company's second quarter -- an important guide,   considering the company reported three straight quarters of   year-over-year revenue declines in fiscal 2016. Apple guided for   second-quarter revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to   $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.Looking beyond the financial results for Apple's second   quarter, Cook said the Apple team is ""excited"" about the products   in its pipeline.The strong quarter for the tech giant, along with a nice   return to growth for the current quarter and for expected revenue   in Q2, reinforces the company's ability to drive results for   shareholders even in a post hyper-iPhone-growth era.Cook was pleased with the company's performance: ""Our team   executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic   headwinds. We are very happy with the continued strong growth in   revenue from services, thanks to the incredible strength of the   Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over 1 billion active   devices.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB) Shows Signs of Hope;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBiotechnology stocks - as represented by theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) - rallied about 2.8% on Tuesday. As a result, the IBB ETF left behind on the daily chart what technical analysts refer to as a bullish outside reversal day.makeArticleAd();The rally came on the back of a meeting with President Donald Trump and several large pharmaceutical CEOs at the White House on Tuesday. While more clarity is needed as to what the Trump administration's exact agenda is for the pharmaceutical space - which includes the world of biotechnology - for the moment, Tuesday's price action in these stocks must be respected.Throughout the presidential campaign, the pharmaceutical sector was an area of focus by the candidates. Stocks within this sector saw plenty of gyrations as a result. While the broader stock market and many sectors pushed to new highs following the election results last November, pharma and biotech stocks largely speaking to this day remain range-bound and have shown relative weakness.IBB ETF ChartsThe best way to illustrate this is by the following ratio chart where I divided the IBB ETF by theS&P 500- as represented by the popularSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY). Note the clear relative weakness that biotech stocks have shown versus the broader stock market.While the fund showed some relative strength on Tuesday, the series of lower highs thus far remains well intact.Click to EnlargeOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see the choppy sideways range that biotechnology stocks have been in since early 2016.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryFrom this angle - and through the lens of directional longer-term investors - this range should be respected. Because until it resolves in one direction or another, IBB's price action is just pushing this group of stocks sideways.Click to EnlargeThe week isn't yet over, and it's difficult to see this on the multiyear chart, but last week and this week (so far), the IBB is marking the charts with long bullish candles. Intraweek selloffs so far are getting bought. This may be an initial bullish signal worth paying attention to.The area around $265-$270 on the IBB is getting increasingly important as support.On the daily chart, we see that the IBB etf has narrowed its trading range since last fall by making a series of higher lows and lower highs. Of note, however, is the breakaway gap to the upside from last November following the presidential election results.Click to EnlargeWhile the IBB is still trotting sideways, the lower end of the post-election up-gap continues to hold as support.Lastly, let's note the bullish price action from yesterday, Jan. 31. The IBB ETF initially traded lower before quickly snapping higher and closing near the very highs of the day. The daily candle fully engulfed the previous 10 days' worth of price action.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunActive investors could try to play some follow-through buying in the fund. If and when this takes hold, it should be able to push the IBB ETF quickly back toward the $285-$290 area for now.Any major bearish reversal, however, and erasing of Tuesday's rally would be bearish and a sign to get out of bullish trades until the next bullish reversal rears its head.Like what you see?

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat, Increase Y/Y;2/1/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Shares ofApple Inc.AAPLwere up over 3% in aftermarket trading following better-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results.Earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.Product DetailsThe good show was driven by impressive sales of Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Performance of Apple's Services business was also impressive.Total iPhone unit sales came in at about 78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue).Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year (with extra one week in the quarter) to nearly $7.2 billion. App Store sales in December alone topped $3 billion. Apple said that it expects Services ""revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year.""Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. QuoteManagement also noted that Apple Pay reported transaction volume growth of 500%, buoyed by expansion to markets like Spain, Japan, Russia and New Zealand. At present Apple Pay is available in 13 markets.Apple Mac unit sales were up 1% year over year to approximately 5.4 million, while revenues grew 7% from the prior-year quarter to $7.2 billion.Coming to iPad, Apple sold 13.1 million units in the quarter, down 19% year over year. Revenues of $5.5 billion were down 22% from the prior year quarter.Other products, which include revenues from Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, declined 8% year over year to over $4 billion. Again, there were no data available on Apple Watch sales or its latest product launch, AirPods.Geographical PerformanceDemand for Apple's products improved across most of the geographical regions except greater China. As much as 64% of sales were from the International markets.Americas (the biggest market for Apple) generated revenues of approximately $32 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year.Europe generated nearly $18.5 billion in revenues, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues from Japan rose 20% year over year to $5.8 billion while the rest of Asia Pacific generated revenues of $5.8 billion, up 8% year over year.Owing to persistent macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around 12% year over year in the Greater China region to $16.2 billion.MarginsGross margin was 38.5%, a decline of 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses increased 9% year over year to $6.8 billion due to higher research & development expenses as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, operating margin plunged 210 bps from the year-ago quarter to 29.8%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowApple's cash and cash equivalents (and short-term marketable securities) were $60.5 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $67.2 billion at fiscal 2016-end.

Apple also said that it has so far returned $201 billion out of the $250 billion capital returns program announced in April last year.The company also declared its quarterly dividend of 57 cents per share payable on Feb 16 to shareholders of record as on Feb13.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 39%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.Our TakeBetter-than-expected iPhone sales have definitely come as a respite. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the high-growth regions for Apple. Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone's growth in China.Nonetheless, Apple is optimistic about long-term growth prospects in regions like China and India. In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal.Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices. Also, in the long run, Apple is expected to benefit from its robust cash position, strength in technology and the ecosystem that it has built, given its loyal customer base. Further, its enterprise collaborations with the likes of Deloitte, IBM Corp.IBM, CiscoCSCOand SAP SESAPare expected to be important long-term growth drivers.Currently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AAPL posted income of $3.28 per share in the same quarter a year earlier, when it generated $75.87 billion in sales.CEO Tim Cook commented on the results:""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""CFO Luca Maestri added:""Our outstanding business performance resulted in a new all-time record for earnings per share, and over $27 billion in operating cash flow. We returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200 billion.""Apple EarningsWhile AAPL stock has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basisin each of the prior three quarters. The same goes for revenue. Q1's numbers largely rekindle confidence in the company's prospects.Almost as important as Apple's top and bottom lines for the first fiscal quarter of the year was the number of iPhones it sold during the accounting period in question.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryBroadly speaking, the pace of sales growth of the iPhone has been slowing as saturation and better competition chip away at Apple's prowess in the market. TheiPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were released in September, before the end of the previous quarter.The bulk of the device's sales, though, came in the subsequent quarter beginning in October. During that three-month span, the company sold 78.2 million of the smartphone ($58.4 billion worth of the device), versus expectations of 77.3 million. The company didn't indicate how many of those were iPhone 7 phones, but Cowen & Co. had forecast 58.5 million iPhone 7's were sold during fiscal Q1.The company's fast-growing digital product arm - music, video and apps - drove respectable revenue during the quarter as well.Digital content as a revenue source had not been a priority for AAPL until sales of Macs, iPhones and iPads began to slow down last year. The companyturned up the heat on this line last year, however, and has turned the unit into Apple's second-biggest piece of revenue pie. Last quarter it contributed $7.17 billion worth of sales, up 18% from year-ago levels, and accounting for 9% of total sales. Analysts had only expected $7.07 billion worth of services revenue.Apple is evenmulling the creation of its own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Geographically, the Americas continue to provide the bulk of Apple's revenue, though China and its neighbors provided the majority of revenuegrowthlast quarter.The Americas accounted for $31.9 billion in Apple's sales last quarter, up 58%. China put $16.2 billion worth of revenue on the table, up 85% year-over-year. Japan and the rest of the Asia-Pacific area only contributed $5.9 billion in sales, but that tally was up 119% versus the tally from the same quarter a year earlier.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit!The future of Apple's business in China hangs in the balance. President Donald Trump's policy plans are said by some to be the beginning of a trade war.Not only would that make iPhones more difficult to sell in China, but would strain Apple's relationships with key manufacturers of iPhone, iPad and Mac components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockLooking ahead, Apple anticipates revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the quarter currently underway. The company doesn't provide earnings guidance, but as of the latest look, the pros collectively believe Apple will earn $2.09 per share of Apple stock on revenue of $53.94 billion.Both figures are higher than year-ago comparisons, and those estimates may well be adjusted higher before the second quarter numbers are posted.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postApple Inc.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit!;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTurnarounds usually aren't neat, orderly affairs, butAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) just keeps building momentum as the semidconductor firm continues to remake itself. Fourth-quarter earnings out Tuesday evening launched AMD stock by another 5% in after-hours trading, continuing a roughly yearlong run that hasn't seen much in the way of pullbacks.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrFor Q4, AMD posted an adjusted loss of 1 cent a share on revenues of $1.11 billion, which were up 15.4% year-over-year. While earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations, sales beat by about $40 million.Also driving AMD stock higher was upbeat earnings guidance for the current quarter. Advanced Micro Devices forecasts revenues to range from $955 million to $1.02 billion. Using the midpoint, AMD would be looking at an 18% increase to$989 million- well above analyst expectations for $964 million.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruarySome additional highlights from AMD's fourth quarter:The Computing and Graphics unit saw its revenues jump by 28% to $600 million.The cash balance increased by $6 million, for a total of $1.26 billion.The company announced the brand of its new chips, called Ryzen. One example of the technology's power: Combined with its Vega GPU, it allows a desktop to runStar Wars: Battlefront - Rogue Oneat 60 frames per second in 4K.The company announced a collaboration withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) for the Radeon GPU technology for cloud computing.AMD announced Radeon Instinct, which allows for high-end deep learning. The product is expected to hit the markets in the first half of this year.AMD Is Primed for GrowthUDPATE:Management typically is conservative when it comes to earnings guidance, so we can anticipate nice traction in 2017, driven by Ryzen. For the most part, the technology looks like it has better performance and power usage compared toIntel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) 8-core, 3.2GHz Core i7-6900K that came out in May - and it's cheaper.No surprise, then, that Alphabet has teamed up with AMD. But don't expect the large-cap tech partnerships to end there, and instead expect them to extend to the likes ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andSalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM)? Headline-making deals like this could very well drive AMD stock in 2017.From CEO Lisa Su:""As we enter 2017, we are well  positioned and on-track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade.""So, should bulls exercise any caution?Well, AMD stock has already staged an amazing rally, and yes, we probably won't see a repeat of 2016's triple-digit gains.After all, Advanced Micro Devices' market cap is now close to $10 billion. Thus, it would need to generate a hefty $450 million in net earnings to get at a 25X multiple. But Wall Street frankly might not care.AMD stock has become an excellent momentum play. Shares have become a way to play some of the hottest markets in technology, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.Apple Inc.

3 ETFs For True Total Market Coverage;1/31/2017;"ETF investors often spend an inordinate amount of time trying to find the best spot in the market.  They love focusing on specific sectors, factors, or tactical strategies that are showing a promising edge.  However, there is often a fundamental need for simple and diversified stock exposure at the lowest possible cost.This type of core foundation is the essence behind total stock market funds.  They allow you to stay correlated with the broadest possible indexes and charge expenses that are so fractional as to be almost non-existent.  They embody the true spirit of the ETF philosophy in their liquidity, tax efficiency, and transparency.The largest and most well-known of this group is theVanguard Total Stock Market ETF(VTI).  Over the years, I’ve lost track of how many awards and commendations this fund has received.  Its true value proposition is the simplicity of a single vehicle for complete U.S. stock market coverage with the lowest possible tracking error.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');VTI owns a basket of 3,592 publicly traded securities across the large, mid, and small-cap verticals.  You can’t get much more diversified than that.  The fund is market-cap weighted to give the largest stocks a greater share of its $70 billion asset base.  Nevertheless, the top holding,Apple Inc(AAPL) only accounts for 2.5% of the total portfolio.  That leaves a large swath of exposure to be distributed through the thousands of remaining holdings.One of the highly touted advantages of VTI is its ultra-low expense ratio of 0.05%.  That’s just $50 for every $100,000 invested on an annual basis.  The minimal expenses ensure this fund is appropriate as a long-term position in virtually any type of equity portfolio.The next largest fund by size is theSchwab US Broad Market ETF(SCHB), which has $7.7 billion under management.  This ETF tracks a basket of 2,000 stocks domiciled in the U.S. through all market-cap segments.SCHB claims one of the lowest industry expense ratios at just 0.03% annually.  This fee has been incrementally lowered multiple times over the years, which adds to its attractiveness for long-term investors.  It’s even conceivable that one day this ETF will charge as low as one basis point per year for access to its diversified stock portfolio.Last, but certainly not least, is theiShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF(ITOT).  This fund shares traits of both VTI and SCHB in its overall makeup.  It charges an expense ratio of 0.03% and contains more than 3,600 underlying holdings.  ITOT has $6.7 billion in assets under management and has been in place since 2004.While all three of these funds have minor differences in their structure, they must ultimately be judged on their results. The 5-year price chart below shows that the returns for all three are almost indistinguishable from each other.That level of correlation is a dependable statistic for those that are agonizing over which is the best fund to pick.  There really is no wrong answer here.  Although, the decision may be made easier if one of these options is available transaction-free from your brokerage platform.  That would truly minimize total costs and allow you to scale in or out of any shares with the lowest possible friction.The Bottom LineTotal market ETFs are solid tools for both experienced investors and those who are just starting out on this journey.  They provide a truly simple path to a diversified stock allocation without having to agonize over various investment styles.  Removing complexity from the equation can result in better execution and a much greater chance for long-term success.Disclosure: At the time this article was written, the author owned shares of ITOT."

Intel Corporation Gets an Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Boost;1/31/2017;"Finally, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has managed to achieve a real degree of success in   the market for chips that go into smartphones. A while back, it   was revealed thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had chosen to use Intel as a second source for the   LTE modems that power its iPhone.Apple's iPhone SE. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Now, while some investors may have worried that Intel might be   ""giving away"" these cellular modems -- in a move similar to what   the company did with its Bay Trail tablet processors (i.e.   providing platform cost offsets valued more than the selling   prices of the chips) -- the company's most recent financial   results show that this is very clearly not the case.The big modem boostIntel's modem sales fall under its Client Computing Group   (CCG), which derives the bulk of its revenue from sales of   processors and other components that go into personal   computers. When Intel reports financial results for CCG, it   gives investors two numbers to chew on: platform revenue and   ""other"" revenue. Platform revenue is made up of processor and   accompanying chipset (also known as a PCH) sales, while ""other""   revenue refers to a smorgasbord of other complementary   technologies, including cellular modems.We can see that Intel is seeing a very large boost in cellular   modem sales because Intel's revenue from ""other"" went from $356   million in the fourth quarter of 2015 -- when Intel sold   precisely zero modems to Apple -- to $773 million in the fourth   quarter of 2016 -- when Intel is known to be selling modems to   Apple.Of course, it's likely that not all of that increase is due to   the ramp up in cellular modem shipments -- Intel did take the   time to highlight that it enjoyed record Wi-Fi chip shipments   last quarter -- but there's really nothing else that can explain   the substantial majority of that increase.What does this revenue increase tell us?The bad news is that we can't deduce too much about the   profitability of these modems solely from these results -- though   Intel did indicate later in the call that cellular modem   shipments during 2017 would serve as a headwind to the company's   gross profit margins. So we know that the modems are sold at   lower than corporate average margins.What we can deduce is this, however: Intel isn't providing   excessive ""contra-revenue"" payments to get these modems into the   iPhone because Intel is generating positive revenue -- and   significant revenue at that -- from its modems. (Although we   already knew this because Intel would almost have certainly   disclosed to investors in advance that a ramp of its modem   shipments would detract from operating profit.) If that were the   case, some investors may have wanted to see the financial   evidence before believing it.Looking aheadIf we assume that Intel is going to continue to supply Apple   with modems beyond the iPhone 7 -- and the odds of this look good   -- then there are some interesting financial   implications. First, Intel's share at Apple may be set to   grow in the coming product cycle. Right now, Intel is in some   portion of the iPhone 7 models, but is completely absent from the   iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s.Once Apple releases new models and waterfalls the iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus to serve as its mid-range offerings -- and if we   assume that Intel and Qualcomm get roughly equivalent order   allocations during the next iPhone cycle to what we're seeing   with the iPhone 7 series -- then Intel's share will necessarily   go up. I also wouldn't be surprised to see Intel inside of a   future iPhone SE, as well.It's reasonable to expect that Intel will see some nice   year-over-year growth in the ""other"" portion of CCG over the   course of 2017, with acceleration happening in the second half of   the year, due to the launch of the new iPhone models.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.However, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The company has already been showing offWindows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be working on a ""lite"" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.The first is that dream of ""Windows everywhere."" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.The second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBooks in sales.Microsoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Before EarningsWindows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.Microsoft refused to comment on theZDNetpost, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is going to avoid all references to Windows RT - that's poison - and the Windows 10 Cloud name could end up being a code name.It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder. Expect to get the final answer on Windows 10 Cloud from Microsoft prior to that April 17 Windows 10 Creators Build release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 ""Golden"" Ammo Stocks to Buy for Big 2017 Returns3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionThe postIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Intel Corporation's Personal-Computer Business Beats Expectations;1/31/2017;"On Jan. 26, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) announced its financial results for the fourth   quarter of 2016 and, by extension, the entirety of 2016.A rendering of an Intel seventh-generation Core processor.     Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();The company had previously guided to $15.7 billion in revenue   for the quarter and gross profit margin of 61%, representing   sequential declines from $15.8 billion and 63.3%,   respectively.Intel's actual financial results were much more impressive;   the company reported $16.4 billion in revenue for the quarter and   a gross profit margin percentage of 61.7%, up from $14.9 billion   and down from 64.3% in the prior year, respectively.For the full year, Intel raked in $59.4 billion at 60.9% gross   profit margin -- a little above the midpoint of its long-term   gross margin range of 55% to 65%, though down 170 basis points   year over year.This upside appears to have been driven, ironically enough, by   the company's Client Computing Group (CCG) business, which   derives the bulk of its revenues from sales of components into   personal computers, generally viewed as a declining market.Let's take a closer look at the company's revenue and profit   performance in this segment.Solid improvements in revenue and     profitabilityIntel reported that total CCG revenue hit $9.13 billion in the   most recent quarter, up from $8.76 billion in the same quarter a   year-ago -- a respectable 4% year-over-year boost.Operating income vastly outpaced revenue, though, with this   figure growing from $2.72 billion in the year-ago quarter to   $3.52 billion in the most recent quarter -- up almost 30% year   over year. Management attributed this to lower operating   expenses, a ""richer product mix,"" and improved product margins as   14-nanometer chip manufacturing yields improved. The same story   has been playing out all year in CCG.Now, it's worth noting that Intel reported that the ""platform""   portion of its CCG revenue, which consists of sales of processors   and chipsets, were roughly flat, at $8.36 billion in the prior   year compared with $8.4 billion in the most recent quarter. But   its ""other"" segment -- which includes complementary products,   such as wireless chips -- saw revenues more than double to $773   million, from $356 million a year-ago.It is likely that this large boost in ""other"" revenue within   CCG was due primarily to the ramp-up of the company's XMM 7360   cellular modem in theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices.Good full-year resultsFor the full year, Intel reported that CCG revenue was up 2%,   while expectations going into the year were for a decline, with   operating profit up a smidgen more than 30%. Platform revenue was   roughly flat, at $30.75 billion versus $30.68 billion, with   ""other"" revenue surging from $1.54 billion in 2015 to $2.16   billion in 2016.The iPhone win clearly contributed to a large part of the   ""other"" segment growth here, but the driver of the increased   platform revenue is a little bit subtler.Indeed, Intel reported that shipments of its notebook computer   processors declined by 1% year over year and that shipments of   its desktop computer processors dropped by 6%. Key to keeping   platform revenues flat was a 2% increase in notebook platform   average selling prices, as well as a 2% increase in desktop   platform average selling prices.What's happening, then, is that computer makers are selling   fewer computers than they were before, as evidenced by the   notebook and desktop platform unit shipment drops, but the   computers that they do sell, on average, contain more expensive   processors.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for   over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them!

5 Reasons I Don't Buy MeetMe's Growth Story;1/31/2017;"Last December, I highlightedMeetMe(NASDAQ: MEET) as apotentially undervaluedgrowth play in a frothy market. The social networking app maker   posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in   monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and   30% non-GAAP earnings growth.Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to   respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at   just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings.   Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying   MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low   valuations.MeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.makeArticleAd();1. A troubling history with sexual predatorsMeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with,   similar toMatch's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently   sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of   MeetMe being used by sexual predators.In 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the   unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation   data, and claimed that  the app ""enabled"" sexual predators   to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving   adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the   case for $200,000 the  following year, agreeing to clarify   and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the   amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state.But the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February,   a Buffalo man was  charged with multiple counts of child   pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles   raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to   18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably   because it would lose a large portion of its users.2. The potential loss of ad revenuesYou'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise   on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app.   That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from   programmatic ads delivered byTwitter's(NYSE:TWTR) MoPub.This means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic --   in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the   platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many   companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on   MeetMe.Therefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to   drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or   advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the   controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios   will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's   reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad   revenues?3. Being booted from the app storesIn its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits  that   its business will suffer if it is ""unable to maintain a good   relationship"" withAppleandAlphabet's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app   stores ""if we violate"" or the companies believe ""that we have   violated"" their terms and conditions.The bulls might believe that's just a typical ""risk factor""   warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that ""on more than   one occasion,"" Apple rejected its app ""because of user generated   content and other concerns."" This indicates that another   high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and   kill its business.4. Tinder is crushing MeetMeMeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in   2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe   waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart   from Google Trends:Image source: Google.That decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor   Skout last  October. That move boosted the company's MAU   count from about 5 million to  8.5 million, and greatly   inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.5. The lack of insider confidenceIf MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd   expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO   Geoffrey Cook just  sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire   position) at an average price of $5.02.Including Cook's sales, insiders sold  1.96 million   shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares.   It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the   stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates   that its upside potential could be limited.The key takeawayThe main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations   and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly   growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But   dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that   it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against   Tinder, which dominates the space with  over 50 million   active users.10 stocks we like better than MeetMeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Trade War Concerns Coming Home to Roost;1/31/2017;"Tuesday, January 31, 2017makeArticleAd();We'd gone more than two months on a Trump Rally that had favorably priced in things like corporate tax cuts and deregulation, opening a clear path toward market gains. Eventually we saw a bid up to the coveted Dow 20,000 - something that had been considered a pipe dream so soon by a plurality of analysts.This morning, however, based on a CNBC survey among economists, protectionist policies of the Trump administration are considered the biggest threat to the U.S. economy. A border adjustment tax is receiving a 45% negative rating from the analysts surveyed - especially regarding two of America's biggest trading partners, China and Mexico - as a trade war scenario begins to emerge.Especially now that we have seen aggressive actions from the nascent administration that, if transferred to candidate Trump's promises on trade, look to radicalize the status quo. This is something the markets had not priced in, but are beginning to do so. Dow 20,000 is now in the rearview mirror - down another 43 points from closing yesterday below the psychologically pleasing 20K round number.Q4 earnings results have also taken a down-turn ahead of the opening bell today: ExxonMobilXOM, Under ArmourUAAand PfizerPFEall reported disappointing results on the bottom line this morning. Under Armour in particular has been hard hit in the pre-market, down initially 28% (now around 24%) on the news, which also included a report that its CFO will be stepping down.After the bell today we'll see AppleAAPLreport earnings results. Estimates of $3.22 per share on $76.2 billion represent a mixed bag from the year-ago quarter, down 6 cents per share but narrowly above Q1 2016 sales totals. The stock is up more than 9% since the Trump Rally began, outperforming the S&P 500 overall.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why Expedia Inc Will Profit From This Global Market Trend (EXPE);1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs an analyst who spends every day looking at numbers, I have a tendency to try and quantify everything. We humans, as a species, tend to do this all the time.makeArticleAd();For the most part, it serves us well. But it can also sometimes be a trap, diminishing the value of what is simply unquantifiable.I learned this lesson a few years ago on a trip to the green highlands and snow-capped mountains of Peru.During the planning phase, I contemplated every detail of the trip, from number of hours spent on flights… nights spent in hotels… how many sites I could see within a certain amount of time. Everything had to be just perfect.But even during the early phases of the journey, I found myself counting…There were four grueling days of hiking. At about 20.5 miles in total length, it took four days to complete. Each night, we camped at about 13,000 feet. And at the summit of our hike, we would reach 14,928 feet.Strenuous hiking at such a high elevation for such an extended period of time meant that every breath, every step, was a laborious effort. But we pressed on, young and old, encouraged each other and offered a helping hand until we reached the end of our journey. And best of all, we knew that each painstaking step meant that we were just that closer to seeing one of the most truly remarkable sights in the world: the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu.It was only during those little moments when I was able to move past this tendency to quantify everything that I truly lost myself in the mystery and wonder the world has to offer.Hopefully, you've had the chance to have experiences like this at some point in your life, too. All too often, we in the developed world tend to take for granted the fact that most of us have the means to do these kinds of things.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018But there are hundreds of millions of people who don't - but they soon will.The World's Burgeoning Middle ClassGlobal demand for travel is surging. Hundreds of millions of people are entering the global middle class right now and in the years to come. One of the first things these people will look to do is travel.By 2030, two-thirds of the global middle class will be residents of the Asia-Pacific region. That's up from just under one-third in 2009. And China alone is expected to have a staggering one billion members of the middle class by then.China's budding middle class is already traveling in greater numbers than ever before. A United Nations tourism report showed that the number of Chinese citizens traveling overseas has surged from 10 million in 2000 to more than 83 million in 2013.This is a huge opportunity for the online travel business. Consumers in the Asia-Pacific region currently book only about 27% of their travels online, while Latin America lags even further at 21%. In China, only about 15% of consumers currently book their travel online. This is compared to rates over 50% in the United States and Europe.It's not hard to imagine that the rest of the world will quickly catch up to the United States and Europe in terms of booking their travel online. And that sets up a tremendous opportunity.That's where my colleague Jimmy Butts comes in with one of his most recent picks in his premium newsletter,Top Stock Advisor…How To Profit From This TrendIn last month's issue of his newsletter, Jimmy reported on the incredible growth of the online travel market. Citing much of the information I referenced above, he went on to recommend two publicly-traded online travel companies.I don't like to make a habit of giving away too many picks from our premium publications, since our subscribers pay good money for this information (to learn how to subscribe,go here). But I can reveal that one of them isExpedia Inc(EXPE), the world's largest online travel company.Surging industry growth is reflected in Expedia's gross bookings. In 2015, the company booked a staggering $60 billion worth of flights, hotels, rental cars and cruises. It's on track to crush those figures in 2016, already racking up gross bookings of more than $56 billion through the first nine months of this year, which is 23% more compared with the first nine months of 2015.Expedia has made major strides in the international market. In 2005, international revenue made up only 22% of its portfolio; last year that soared to approximately 45%. But that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential for growth. Despite being the largest player in online travel, the company still has only a 4% share of the global market.This speaks to the highly-fragmented nature of the market, but also for the potential to grow through acquisitions, which Expedia has been doing for some time now already. Between the growth in the global middle class and growth in the online travel market, Jimmy thinks Expedia should benefit greatly over the next 5-10 years.As such, it's a good long-term holding to consider adding to your portfolio.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 EarningsJimmy's other pick, however, may have even more potential. I won't give away the name here (to get it, you'll have to subscribe toTop Stock Advisor.) But it has a hold on 50% of the online travel market in China - which by all accounts should be the prime growth market in in the years ahead.While the real value of travel may not be quantifiable, investors who back this company now could be counting sizeable gains within a few years.

But the top-line, $61 billion in revenue, was about a half-billion above those estimates.For the year, the company earned $7.84 billion, $1.88 per share. This sounds impressive, but it's less than half of 2015's $16.15 billion in earnings, and that in turn was half of 2014's $32.52 billion. The initial response of traders was cautious, with Exxon stock opening only slightly below the previous day's close of $84.86 per share.The question for XOM stock investors remains, is this the bottom, and how quick might the turn be?Exxon Stock Is Hanging In ThereThe year 2016 was a year that XOM stock had to hang in and tough things out. The earnings release emphasized that cash flow and asset sales covered the dividend of 75 cents per share. The dividend costs the company about $3 billion per quarter, and the quarterly earnings continue to come up short of that mark.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe company has kept earnings positive by cutting back sharply on capital expenditures. It spent $4.83 billion during the fourth quarter, against $7.42 billion a year earlier. For the year, Exxon invested $19.30 billion, against $31.05 billion in 2015.This has yet to have a big impact on production, which was down just 3%, or 127,000 barrels per day, from 2015's figures during the fourth quarter, with new volume in Nigeria and Indonesia partly making up for the declining production of U.S. fields. The company lost $2.3 billion producing oil, which it calls ""upstream"" operations, and $1.2 billion refining and selling it, which it calls ""downstream"" operations. The profit came from chemicals, $872 million, and finance earnings of $209 million.XOM Stock: Swing and a MissInitial reporting on the release emphasized the earnings miss.CNBC said the numbers""badly"" missedestimates on earnings, and Marketwatch just used the word""miss.""The Nasdaq.com headline emphasized that earnings fell 40%from a year earlier.However, writers hedged their stories by noting the strength of Exxon stock and pointing out that the shares were already down nearly 6% for 2017, and after an initial fall of a few cents, XOM stock quickly found its footing in pre-market trading, getting above $85 per share. The yield remains fat at 3.5%, so the downside for Exxon stock will be muted.Better Times Ahead for XOM?It's anticipation of bigger things that keeps Exxon stock players coming back. InvestorPlace Feature Writer James Brumley holds out great hope for a deal, whichtook the Bass family prospects in the Permian Basin back into the fold.XOM stock investors expected an update on Texas productionat the company's earnings conference call.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 EarningsDespite the recent fall in the Exxon stock price, the 320-day moving averagehas been rising for over two monthswith speculators saying it needed to hold $84.55 to maintain the up-trend. That seemed likely.Analysts continue to hold their breath on XOM stock, with half now sitting in the ""hold"" camp, one having recently switched off ""strong buy"" and one having switched off ""strong sell.""The bottom line for Exxon stock is that, if Trump is as good for oil as advertised, the company should be seeing that in results as 2017 unfolds.

Alphabet Employees Protest Against Trump's Immigration Ban;1/31/2017;"Protests against Donald Trump's anti-immigration policy are gaining steam and the technology sector appears to be leading the way.  More than 2000Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle employees staged protests against Trump's immigration ban by walking out of eight offices worldwide including the company's headquarters in Mountain View on Monday. Photos and videos of the walkouts have been tweeted using hashtag #GooglersUnite.Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai have extended their full support to the opposition.Concurrent with the protest, Google created a $4 million fund to support immigrant rights groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the International Rescue Committee.The protest was particularly against Trump's executive order to ban nationals of seven Muslim majority countries - Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Yemen - from coming to the U.S. Pichai denounced the order and stated that the ban affects about 187 Google employees.We note that not quite long ago, Trump had called up technology leaders and urged them to create and retain jobs within the U.S. to which most of them had given their nods. However as the immigration ban order rolled out, the sector is sending clear indications that it will not create jobs at the cost of preventing entry to external talent.Alphabet Inc. Free Cash Flow (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Free Cash Flow (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteProtests Across the Technology IndustryTrump's immigration restrictions have faced the flak of tech leaders in the form of tweets, memos and statements. Chief executive officers of MicrosoftMSFT, AppleAAPL, NetflixNFLX, Uber, Airbnb and Tesla Motors have all indicated that they are against the decision.The technology sector recruits a big chunk outside talent and the survival of the sector could be at stake if immigration reduces or stops completely.The sector fears that Trump may overhaul the H1-B program that allows Silicon Valley to bring foreign engineers and technical experts to the U.S. for three to six years.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementAt present, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

3 Questions for Apple, Inc. CEO Tim Cook Today;1/31/2017;"After the market closes today,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) will report results for its first fiscal quarter   of 2017. Ending Dec. 31, the quarter includes the important   holiday period, raising the stakes for the company's performance.   Thanks to seasonality and the timing of Apple's latest iPhone   launch, the quarter is expected to include record-high   revenue.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();While Apple's earnings release will give investors a useful   window into the company's financial performance, the tech giant's   earnings call will likely provide investors with some useful   nuggets, too. Ahead the earnings call, which will take place   shortly after Apple releases its financial results for the   quarter, here are three topics Apple CEO Tim Cook will hopefully   address.1. How confident is management in its product pipeline?Recently, Apple's iPhone business has not only leveled off,   but it has also been in decline. In Apple's fourth fiscal quarter   of 2016, for instance, iPhone revenue and unit sales were down   13% and 5% year over year, respectively. While some investors may   be hoping the iPhone can return to growth in Apple's first   quarter, investors -- or Apple -- shouldn't count on the iPhone   to be a major growth driver for the company in the future.Since iPhone accounts for about 60% of Apple's total sales,   the segment's headwinds make the health of the tech giant's   product pipeline more important than ever. Of course, given the   company's tendency to keep things secret, investors shouldn't   expect to get any specific information on new products from Cook   during Apple's earnings call, but investors can still look for   the CEO to talk about his level of confidence in the company's   upcoming products.2. What could Apple's services revenue growth look like in   2017?As Apple's iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other products segments   turning to year-over-year revenue declines recently, the   company's services segment, which includes sales from iTunes,   Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and   other services, has continued to grow nicely. In Apple's most   recent quarter, services revenue increased 24% year over   year.During Apple's earnings call, investors should look to see if   Cook discusses how the company expects this segment to fair in   2017 and beyond. This question could come in many forms,   including:Does Apple expect Apple Music to evolve into a significant     driver for the company?Is growth for Apple Pay accelerating? Or has it leveled     off?Are there new services Apple could launch to continue     building out its services ecosystem?How significant of a role does Apple expect services to     play in the long-term?3. If there's a tax break for repatriation, does Apple plan   to take advantage of it?Considering President Donald Trump's plan to offer a one-off   tax holiday for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas funds   at a lower tax rate, investors are interested in whether Apple   plans to take part in such a tax break, and, if it does, to what   extent.Image source: Getty Images.Of Apple's enormous $238 billion cash hoard reported in the   company's fourth quarter, a whopping $216 billion is held outside   of the Unite States. If Apple has aggressive plans for taking   advantage of this tax break, the company could significantly   increase its dividend, boost its share repurchase program, pay   out a special dividend, or even do all three.Investors can listen online to Apple's live conference call,   which can be found on the company's investor relations website,   on Tuesday, Jan. 31, at 2:00 p.m. PT.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple (AAPL) Earnings on Tap: iPhone, AirPods, App Store on Display;1/31/2017;"Apple iPhone (Shutterstock photo)Apple (AAPL) is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. The Cupertino-based tech giant, which has beaten Wall Street earnings per share estimates in two straight quarters, is expected to break its streak of declining revenue at three. And the revenue increase will be driven by the barrage of new products Apple launched in the past three months.Notably, Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices. Beyond the new line of MacBooks and iPads, analysts may get a glimpse of the degree of demand Apple enjoyed for its wireless AirPods, of which CEO Tim Cook in December hinted that Apple couldn’t make them fast enough. Investors are also eager to learn how well Apple’s services business has performed.makeArticleAd();Apple earlier this month disclosed its App Storeexperienced a 40% year-over-year surgein revenue in 2016. Apple says on New Year's day alone, customers spent nearly $240 million on apps and in-app purchases, marking the App Store's largest single-day of sales ever. For that matter, the App Store in December logged its highest-grossing month in its history, generating some $3 billion in revenue. How much of that total trickled to the bottom line during the quarter remains to be seen.The company also said it posted a 74% surge in billings from subscription services like Netflix (NFLX), popular dating app Tinder and Time Warner's (TWX) HBO Now, reaching to $2.7 billion.Why is all of this important? Apple has increasingly emphasized the cash flow generated from its Services segment. The Services business, which includes the App Store, revenues from Apple Pay and Apple Music, rose 24% in the fourth quarter, posting revenue of $6.3 billion. This was preceded by a 19% rise in the third quarter.In other words, Apple realizes it can not live by iPhones alone. Can it maintain the uptrend? On Tuesday analysts will scrutinize just how much closer Apple is to that reality. But for now, the iPhone remains Apple’s cash cow. And, beyond the headline earnings and revenue numbers, that’s where the focus will be. Despite fears about longer upgrade cycles, increased competition and slow growth in emerging markets, analysts are generally positive about the recantation the iPhone 7 has received.In the three months that ended December, analysts expect Apple to report earnings per share of $3.23, down from $3.28 in the year-earlier on revenue of revenue of $77.4 billion. This compares to Apple's guidance range of $76 billion to $78 billion when it last reported earnings in October. Analysts expect Apple to have sold 78 million iPhones, which would be a 4% rise from the 75 million sold a year ago.Average selling prices, meanwhile, are projected to be $687 per unit, down $735 a year ago. However, thanks to prospect of higher shipments, iPhone revenues are expected to rise 3% to $53.1 billion. Meanwhile, data compiled by FactSet suggests Services revenue will reach $6.9 billion, up 13% year over year. To the extent Apple can beat on both the top and bottom lines, exceeds iPhone unit salesandprovide confident guidance, Apple stock should continue to climb.Apple shares, which have a consensus Buy rating and $135 price target, closed Monday at $121.68, down 0.22%. The shares have risen 5.06% year to date, compared with a 1.83% rise in the S&P 500 Index."
Amazon (AMZN) Film Division to Premiere Patriot on Feb 24;1/31/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Amazon.com Inc.'sAMZNfilm production division, Amazon Studios, has scheduled the premiere of its original one-hour series, Patriot, on Feb 24.For now, the series will be available for Prime members on Prime Video in the U.S., UK, Germany and Austria.

It has been executive produced by Steven Conrad, James Parriott, Glenn Ficarra, John Requa, Charles Gogolak and Gil Bellows.Our TakeThe increasing popularity of tablets, smartphones and web-connected TVs has enhanced online-video viewing and continues to attract consumers as well as leading technology companies, like AlphabetGOOGLand Apple Inc.AAPL.Therefore, Amazon is leaving no stone unturned to boost its digital media sales and attract new viewers, by adding varied series and movies to its content lineup and making Prime Video more attractive.With intense competition in online video content, majors such as Netflix, Inc.NFLX, Hulu and HBO, are seeing substantial success.

In the case of Apple, this number topped $618 billion as of late December 2016, coming in ahead of competitors Alphabet at $548 billion, Microsoft at $494.6 billion, Amazon at $366 billion and Facebook at $343.1 billion.Apple stock is positioned to move even higher in 2017. The company is aggressively buying back stock, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share. Its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus, are the best-selling phones in its history. Apple also holds roughly $200 billion in overseas cash, which might move home this year if corporate taxes on repatriation are lowered. To top it all off, the stock is trading at just about 10 times earnings.2. Gilead Sciences:GILDIf you're looking for a short-term stock that had a rough go of it in 2016, Gilead Sciences might be your pick. The biotechnology company's sales of its hepatitis C drug declined and the stock fell 29 percent in 2016.Gilead could turn out to be one of the best stocks for 2017, however. The company trades at the compelling valuation of 6.99 times estimated earnings over the next year. It's bought back 14 percent of its stock over the past three years, and with its $32 billion cash hoard, the company might continue to buy more or make strategic acquisitions. Gilead also uses its cash to pay out a 2.5 percent dividend to shareholders. The stock could very well hit $101 in 2017, according to analysts at JP Morgan.3. Alphabet:GOOGAlphabet, formerly known as Google, is one of the world's great businesses, according to Barron's. The company owns numerous products and services including Google Maps and Google Play, YouTube, Nest, Chrome, Android, and Gmail. Analysts project 2017 revenues for the company in excess of $103 billion, which would represent a growth rate of more than 18 percent.Given the current political climate, Alphabet might see a short-term boost in the form of repatriated cash. The company currently holds about $80 billion in cash overseas, which translates to around $115 per share. Additionally, it has a lot of room for cost cutting because it spends freely on noncore businesses. Some analysts are estimating $41 per share in earnings this year, which would be huge since the company currently trades at just 18 times earnings.4. Facebook:FBEven if you don't use Facebook at home or on your smartphone, it's hard to avoid its presence in store windows or on advertising asking you to ""like"" something. The key to Facebook's financial success is its monetization of its enormous customer base. It has 1.79 billion monthly active users — and that number continues to rise. Lately, Facebook's stock price has gone up and exceeded analyst earnings estimates by an average of 21.11 percent.Facebook is still investing in ways to grow its earnings even more, with mobile ads and video revenues currently doing the heavy lifting. The company is also expecting big things out of its virtual reality investments. With a long-term growth rate of 27.6 percent, the company is expected to continue its rise.5. Citigroup:CCitigroup could benefit from a number of factors in 2017, including rising interest rates. TheFederal Reserve raised interest ratesfor just the second time in a decade in 2016. The Fed indicated that it expects to hike rates an additional three times in 2017. In response, the two-year Treasury note hit its highest rate since 2009. When interest rates rise, banks can charge more money on loans and credit cards, potentially increasing their profitability.Citigroup's stock has lagged compared with its peers' so far in 2017, which gives it room to catch up. The stock trades at just about 11 times its expected earnings for next year — and it trades at the widest discount-to-book value of the major banks. This means the stock is discounted more than 25 percent compared with the price-earnings ratios of its peers, making it a possible value play.6. IBM:IBMIBM is another turnaround candidate for 2017. The company used to dominate the computer hardware and services business sector but has been surpassed in recent years by its competitors. However, its slow turn toward the more modern businesses of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobility and security is showing signs of bearing fruit.The company spent more than $5 billion in acquisitions in 2016 alone, and its new product lines now account for more than 40 percent of firm revenues. Its analytics division showed revenue growth of 16 percent, and its cloud business jumped by 42 percent — both hopeful signs for future growth. IBM's artificial intelligence business has generated positive buzz thanks to its Watson cognitive system, which is known for beating two human ""Jeopardy!"" contestants. The stock trades at a 12.19 price-earnings ratio based on expected 2017 earnings.7. Norwegian Cruise Line:NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line is poised to benefit from the rapidly growing cruise segment and could be one of the best stocks to buy now. With the core demographic of aging baby boomers on the rise, cruise lines are a growing market. The company doesn't pay dividends to shareholders but reinvests its cash flow into building more ships and expanding its routes. Norwegian has already won approval to sail to Cuba, and it has repositioned its calendar to deploy ships into the fast-growing Asian market for the first time in 15 years.Norwegian boasts the newest fleet among its major North American competitors, making it attractive to customers looking for the latest and greatest offerings. The company owns a diversified portfolio of maritime brands including Oceania and Regent Seven Seas. Analysts estimate the stock will grow earnings by more than 18 percent in 2017 — the stock trades at just 14 times 2017 estimates.8. Amazon:AMZNAmazon has grown from an online bookseller to the eighth-largest retailer in the world, and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. Amazon will become the largest apparel seller in the U.S. by 2021, when it will be selling $62 billion in apparel annually — more than TJ Maxx and Macy's combined — according to analysts at Cowen Group.Amazon is firing on multiple fronts: It's poised to capitalize on streaming media's popularity via its Amazon Prime subscription service. Additionally, its Web Services business is more advanced than competitors Microsoft and Alphabet's cloud offerings, thanks to it being first to market. Analysts at Evercore ISI Institutional Equities cite Amazon as the best internet stock for 2017. Excitement is also brewing over Amazon's latest foray into the grocery business, Amazon Go. In true disruptor fashion, Amazon's take on the grocery store is to use sensors rather than grocery clerks.9. Restoration Hardware:RHRestoration Hardware is a well-known, luxury home furnishings brand that suffered through 2016. Its earnings fell and triggered a stock sell-off in which shares lost more than half their value. However, the company has shown some signs of being a possible candidate for short-term traders. In its most recent quarter, revenue actually rose 3 percent and beat analysts' estimates by more than $20 million. Earnings also beat Wall Street expectations by 4 cents per share.In addition to rebounding sales and earnings, Restoration Hardware conducted an image makeover. Going forward, the company will be called simply ""RH."" Additionally, the company has launched a new, RH Modern line. In an attempt to capitalize on a more current type of revenue stream, RH is now offering annual memberships. As a result, analysts peg the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20.33 percent, with earnings for the upcoming year jumping 61.27 percent.10. Toll Brothers:TOLToll Brothers is a leading luxury home builder, a business that's been hit hard on many fronts. Although risks remain, the fear of rising interest rates dampening homebuying activity has sent Toll Brothers stock to a bargain price. The company now trades at less than 10 times its anticipated 2017 earnings, which are expected by some to rise 20 percent.Some concerns over the luxury condo market in New York City also hang over the stock, but company reps indicate that earnings will hold up. With the stock seemingly priced for a worst-case scenario, its valuation of about 1.2 times book value is compelling. If housing markets hold firm or interest rates don't rise dramatically, Toll Brothers stock could prove surprising to those anticipating the worst.11. Deutsche Telekom:DTEGYDeutsche Telekom is a German stock that many investors might recognize as the former parent of U.S. T-Mobile. The company still owns a 65 percent stake in the independently traded T-Mobile — and that stock has been skyrocketing. Deutsche's core European telecom business trades at a discount compared with its peers — it fell by 13 percent in 2016 — even though it's the leading wired and wireless operator in Germany. Sporting a nearly 4 percent yield, some analysts describe the stock as undervalued.A takeover play might happen in 2017: Comcast has had its eye on T-Mobile as a potential purchase. T-Mobile might also make another attempt to merge with Sprint, which could end up being a catalyst for Deutsche's stock. If everything falls into place, a share price of $20 isn't inconceivable.12. Sprouts Farmers Market:SFMSprouts Farmers Market flies under the radar of many investors because it's not really a headline-making stock. This lack of publicity might work to its advantage, however, as more investors become aware of its potential. Sprouts is drawing customers from the growing natural and organic food segment — and it prices its goods below that of its notable peer, Whole Foods Market. As a result, some analysts see the company generating mid-teens earnings and revenue growth in the foreseeable future.The company is growing out of its base in the American Southwest and moving east, growing 14 percent in square footage every year. Coupled with its favorable market segments, Sprouts is generating positive cash flow and returning cash to shareholders via a stock buyback program. At 20.5 times estimated 2017 earnings, the stock could be ready to move.13. Delta Air Lines:DALDelta Air Lines has greatly improved its financial performance but still trades at a typical airline multiple of about nine times estimated 2017 earnings. Since 2009, Delta has worked to cut its debt in half. As a result, it now has an investment grade rating from independent ratings service Moody's. To further entice shareholders, Delta pays a 1.7 percent dividend and has aggressively repurchased stock.Delta management feels the stock should be valued more like a diversified industrial company, which would dramatically raise its multiple, and, therefore, its share price. If you need another short-term catalyst, look at the company's free cash flow. Delta is a cash-flow machine — it generated $4.1 billion in cash flow in the last 12 months alone and put just 9.8 percent of that into dividend payments, according to Forbes.14. Novartis:NVTSAnother value play for 2017 could be Novartis, a Swiss diversified drug company and the world's biggest prescription drugmaker. The company's share price had a difficult 2016 but now trades at about 15 times next year's earnings. With a yield of about 3.75 percent, Novartis has an analyst consensus price target of $87, some $15 north of its current price.Part of what held Novartis back in 2016 was fear over the slow start of Entresto, its heart-failure drug, but some analysts think sales will soon accelerate and could go as high as $3 billion. Novartis also gets 25 percent of its sales from high-growth, emerging markets, which makes it less dependent on the more mature U.S. drug market. The company's recent purchase of Encore Vision should also shore up its vision sales and further enable it to diversify its holdings.15. General Motors:GMGeneral Motors has been an integral part of the global auto industry for more than 100 years and has recently faced headwinds. Some market participants feel that global auto sales have peaked, and concerns over themovement to electric vehicleshave held back GM stock. Whatever the reasons are, General Motors currently trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 4.3. Even industry competitors — like Ford, which trades at a ratio of 6.6, and Toyota, which trades at 9.7 times — trade at higher multiples, and GM's average price-earnings ratio over the past five years is 12.2.GM could move higher as the market appreciates its emerging electric and hybrid portfolio. Some analysts feel GM has the bankroll and technology to undersell rivals such as Tesla and perhaps even compete on quality at some point. GM stock began rallying at the end of 2016, which leads some analysts to predict it could double in price over the next one or two years.Data is accurate as of Jan. 25, 2017.

3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 Earnings;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven ifApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) weren't the biggest company in the world (as measured by market cap), its quarterly earnings reports would still arguably be the most-watched reports for any given earnings seasons. Not only are a wide swath of many other companies linked to Apple's success, but AAPL stock itself is something of a barometer for the broad market.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleYet, the last few quarterly earnings announcements have also raised questions, not the least of which is whether or not iPhone-mania has run its course. The growth pace has been undeniably tapering off.That's going to be the hot button on Tuesday, after the close, when the Apple earnings report for its fiscal first quarter is due.Apple Earnings PreviewAs of the most recent look, Apple isexpected to post earnings of $3.22 per shareon revenue of $77.42 billion for the quarter ending in December. The company itself had guided for Q1 revenue of between $77 and $78 billion. That bottom line would be a tad lower than the $3.28 per share of AAPL stock reported for the same quarter a year earlier, though the top line would be up just a bit from the prior year's first fiscal quarter tally of $75.87 billion.Apple needs a strong showing on Tuesday. Although it has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basis in each of the prior three quarters. Ditto for revenue.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAAPL stock investors have been patient thus far, giving CEO Tim Cook time to adjust to a maturing market. A shortfall and/or another quarter of shrinking numbers, however, may push those traders' patience over the edge.3 Things to Watch for AAPLNot that Apple doesn't have a myriad of things going on at any given time, but for the most part, investors tend to focus on what they perceive as the biggest three. The three items that will be doing most of the driving for AAPL stock after Tuesday's report are (in no particular order)…iPhone 7 salesIt's the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Strong sales of the company's flagship device can cure all other ills, but if sales of the company's most recent iteration of the iPhone fall short, little else matters.Expectations are widely varied on this front too. Cowen & Co.thinks Apple sold 58.5 million units of the iPhone 7 last quarter, while Drexel Hamilton believes Applesold 76 million iPhones- not just the iPhone 7 - during its fiscal Q1. The overall consensus, though, isan average of 77.3 million units. Presumably most of those are the 7 and 7 Plus models.Apps and Digital ContentWhile Apple used to be a hardware company that also happened to facilitate the purchase of smartphone apps, music and video media, digital content is increasingly becomingan important part of the revenue mixas saturation becomes a real issue.The company doesn't offer much in the way of expectations for how its revenue breaks down, but we do know that in the previous quarter, Apple enjoyed revenue of $6.3 billion for its ""Services"" division, which is mostly made up of its video, audio and apps arms. That was a 24% year-over-year improvement. That makes it thesecond-biggest category of product for Apple, though it's still well behind the biggest - the iPhone.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?AAPL is even mulling the creation ofits own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Donald Trump AgendaIt remains to be seen to what extent, if any, it will be discussed within the Apple earnings report and conference call. Maybe it won't come up at all, but there's no denying AAPL is one of the more vulnerable companies to President Donald Trump's policy plans.Not only might a strict foreign worker and immigration policy limit Apple's access to technical talent, but much-discussed tariffs on Chinese-made imports could start a trade war that leaves Apple right in the middle of it. Not only does Apple sell products to Chinese consumers, it relies on China to make many of the iPhone's key components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockWith a trailing P/E of 14.5, Apple shares are priced fairly … maybe even undervalued. That's apt to be a large part of the reason the pros are collectively rating AAPL a bit better than a ""Buy"" right now (leaning toward a ""Strong buy."") That optimism, though, is a bit suspicious in light of the lackluster results we've seen for the prior three quarters. Apple is going to have to outperform most expectations if the stock's to build any further on the 34% gain it has mustered since May of last year.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeThe post3 Things Apple Inc.

Why Isn't Qualcomm's Pain Intel's Gain?;1/30/2017;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recently plunged to a multi-month low after the   chipmaker was hit by an FTCantitrust lawsuitin the U.S. andadditional lawsuitsfrom its longtime customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Apple, which exclusively used Qualcomm's   baseband modems in its iPhones between 2011 and 2016, claims that   Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebate payments (compensation for   that deal) after it cooperated with Korean FTC regulators, which   were probing Qualcomm.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();This strained relationship between the two tech giants sounds   like great news forIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which started supplying Apple with modems for   the iPhone 7 after its exclusive deal with Qualcomm ended. The   reason is simple -- Apple could potentially buy all of its modems   from Intel if it severs its relationship with Qualcomm.But Intel shares barely budged after Apple sued Qualcomm, and   only recently rallied following its fourth quarter earnings beat.   Let's take a closer look at why investors don't seem convinced   that Qualcomm's pain can generate significant gains for   Intel.Understanding Intel's mobile strategyIntel doesn't report its modem sales separately. They're   included in its massive Client Computing Group, which includes PC   and mobile chips. The group was created in 2015 to divert   attention from the ongoing losses at its mobile division, which   previously reported its results separately. Those losses were   caused by its generous subsidization of OEMs, with co-marketing   agreements, steep discounts, and financial aid for using its   mobile Atom chipsets.By the timeIntel killed offmost of its mobile Atom chips last year, the unit had spent   billions of dollars to capture just 1% of the market. Intel's   fatal mistakes are easy to see in retrospect -- it sold off its   ARM-based Xscale unit in 2006 to focus on x86 chips in 2006, then   rejected Apple's offer to produce application processors for the   first iPhone.Since much of the Android market uses Qualcomm SoCs, which   bundle baseband modems together with ARM-based processors, Intel   realized that the Atom couldn't gain much ground in the mobile   market. Instead, it had to develop modems for OEMs like Apple,   which developed their own ARM-based processors without integrated   modems.Image source: Apple.Why Intel investors aren't excitedThe problem with Intel is that it was likely negotiating terms   with Apple from a position of weakness, due to its need to stay   relevant in the mobile market. Since Intel has a long record of   taking losses to gain market share in the mobile market, it's   reasonable to assume that Intel sold its modems to Apple at very   favorable prices for the hardware maker.Last year, Cowen & Co. analysts estimated that the deal   could  generate $1.5 billion in revenues for Intel -- which   would only equal 2.5% of its projected revenues this year. Even   if Apple dropped Qualcomm and doubled its orders from Intel, that   growth wouldn't significantly offset Intel's sluggish growth in   PC and data center chips. Moreover, those modems would likely   only generate low-margin revenues, which wouldn't significantly   boost its bottom line growth.To make matters worse, Apple throttled the speed of    Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 to match the slower speed   of the Intel modems. This indicates that Apple didn't choose   Intel chips because they could match Qualcomm's -- it likely only   did so to reduce Qualcomm's negotiating power. This means that   other OEMs that use stand-alone Qualcomm modems won't likely   switch over to Intel modems anytime soon. This misstep mirrors   Intel's failure in mobile application processors -- several OEMs   initially gave the Atom a chance, but it was doomed by its   inability to match the power efficiency of ARM-based designs.What Intel investors should expectIntel investors shouldn't assume that Apple's battle with   Qualcomm indicates that the two longtime partners will part ways   anytime soon. Apple andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been suing each other for years, yet the   Korean tech giant is still one of its top suppliers. Therefore,   Apple is likely trying to get Qualcomm to lower its chip prices   and licensing fees instead of completely parting ways with the   chipmaker.Even if Apple abandoned Qualcomm, investors shouldn't assume   that Intel will inherit the entire modem business. Apple often   splits component orders from multiple manufacturers, and it has   enough resources to develop its own modems -- which would cut   both Intel and Qualcomm out of the loop.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Much Can Apple's Services Drive Profit Growth?;1/30/2017;"Image source: Apple.Much has been made ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) services revenue over the last year or so. After   it was clear Apple would struggle to continue growing iPhone   sales following the outstanding success of the iPhone 6, CEO Tim   Cook commented that a ""growing portion of our revenue is directly   driven by our existing install base."" That is, sales of apps,   content, iCloud, Apple Care, and other Apple Services will   account for an outsized portion of Apple's revenue growth going   forward.makeArticleAd();To be clear, Apple is still very much a hardware company.   Apple's services revenue accounted for just 11% of Apple's total   sales in fiscal 2016. The iPhone, by comparison, made up 63% of   revenue. But services revenue grew 22% last year, faster than any   other segment.With stalling hardware sales growth, investors may be   wondering if growing services revenue is enough to move the   needle on Apple's bottom line.All about the marginsDespite its relatively small size, Apple's services business   generates higher margins than its hardware sales. That's simply   the nature of software, which sees wider margins as products   reach scale. And very few companies have the scale of Apple; the   company has over 1 billion devices in use.Apple's App Store sales have a gross margin of about 90%,   according to estimates from Macquarie Securities analyst Ben   Schachter. Overall, he estimates the rest of Apple's services   have a gross margin of 65%. That means Apple's services revenue   has a gross margin about twice as large as its hardware   sales.Importantly, the App Store -- Apple's highest-margin product   -- is one of the fastest-growing pieces of Apple's services. Last   year, App Store revenueclimbed over 33%. Schachter expects it to climb 28% on average over the next five   years while non-App Store services grow just 10% annually. That   means Apple's services margin will continue to expand.How it all impacts Apple's gross profitEven if hardware sales remain flat, that won't prevent Apple   from expanding its install base. As Cook mentioned in the   company's first-quarter earnings call last year, ""Because of the   enduring value of the device, their replacing is likely higher to   be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it often.""   In other words, even if Apple isn't selling more devices directly   to consumers, the user base can grow through third-party resales   or gifting.A growing user base combined with growing service sales per   unit ought to continue driving revenue growth for the segment for   several more years.A dollar in sales growth from services will carry twice the   gross profit, on average, as a dollar in sales growth of Apple's   hardware. So, even though services is a relatively small business   right now, it outpunches its weight class, providing   approximately 21% of gross profits in 2016. That number is set to   expand as more of Apple's sales growth comes from services.As an illustration of the impact of Apple's service revenue   growth, a 20% increase in services revenue in fiscal 2017 would   result in about a 4% increase in the company's total gross profit   and a 70 basis point expansion in gross margin if all else   remains equal. Considering the size of Apple, that's pretty   significant growth. Schachter estimates Apple's gross margin will   expand as much as 400 basis points over the next five years.Gross margin expansion combined with modest revenue growth and   share buybacks should continue to boost Apple's earnings per   share at a fairly steady pace. Analysts expect 13.8% EPS growth   over the next five years, but there could be even more upside   depending on how much margins expand. With shares trading at a   price-to-earnings ratio of just 14.4, shares may still be   undervalued if Apple can maintain hardware sales and continue   growing services revenue as expected.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is the Bar Higher for the Q4 Earnings Season?;1/30/2017;"Even as Earnings growth appears to have improved notably relative to the last couple of years, positive surprises appear hard to come to by. This becomes evident from looking at the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates in the ongoing Q4 earnings season. You can see that in the comparison chart below that compares the proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS and revenue estimates with what this same group of companies reported in the preceding quarter, as well as the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages.With results from 171 S&P 500 index members already out or 34.1% of the index's total membership, positive surprises are tracking below historical periods, particularly with respect to EPS surprises. If we see this trend continue in the coming days as the rest of Q4 reports come in, then it would mean that estimates likely hadn't dropped enough ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, the bar may have been bit higher this time around relative to other recent quarters.makeArticleAd();With respect to the Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 171 S&P 500 members that have reported as of January 30th. Total earnings for these 171 index members are up +6% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.3% beating EPS estimates and 54.4% beating revenue estimates. We discussed earlier how the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates has been tracking below historical periods. But we don't have that issue on the growth front, with both earnings and revenue growth tracking above other historical periods for the same group of 171 index members.The chart below shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rate for these 171 companies compare with other recent periods.The Finance sector is a big contributor to the aggregate growth picture at this stage. For the Finance sector, we now have Q4 results from 57.9% of the sector's total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 67.5% beating EPS estimates and 45% beating revenue estimates. Excluding the Finance sector from the results thus far, total earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 companies that have reported would be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +3% higher revenues. This is still better growth than we have seen from the same group of ex-Finance S&P 500 members, as the comparison chart below shows.Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 171 index members that have reported results with estimates from the still-to-come 329 companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 earnings growth drops to +1% on +4.2% higher revenues.For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.Apple(AAPL), which alone brings in roughly a quarter of the sector's total earnings, is expected to report -7.8% lower earnings on +0.4% higher revenues as it comes out with its quarterly results after the close on Tuesday January 31st. Excluding the Apple drag, total Q4 earnings for the rest of the Tech sector would be up +11.4% on +5.5% higher revenues.Facebook(FB), which reports after the market's close on Wednesday February 1st, doesn't carry as much weight in the sector as the iPhone maker. But Facebook's Q4 earnings are expected to be up +91% from the same period last year on +44.5% higher revenues.Amazon(AMZN) isn't technically a Technology stock (it's a retailer), but it is also expected to show strong growth in its quarterly report that comes out after the close on Thursday February 2nd.Looking beyond Q4, the growth pace is expected to ramp up notably in the current and following quarters, as the chart below shows.As you can see, total 2017 Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +8.7% from the same period last year. The chart below shows Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last few weeks.It is not unusual for 2017 Q1 estimates to be coming down at this stage of the 2016 Q4 reporting cycle, but a lot will depend on the pace and magnitude of these negative revisions in the coming days. At this stage, Q1 estimates aren't falling by as much as has historically been the case. This should add to confidence in market expectations for the following quarters when growth is expected to really ramp up.Note: Note: Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

But Apple's top line for the current   quarter, and the company's guidance for revenue in its second   fiscal quarter of 2017, will likely be the main drivers behind   any moves in the stock price after the results go live.For its first quarter, Apple guided for revenue of $76 billion   to $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.   Investors will be looking for Apple to meet or exceed its   guidance range, particularly since Apple has reported   year-over-year revenue declines in the last three quarters.   Revenue in this range would mark an all-time high for the   company.For Apple's second-quarter revenue guidance, the number for   Apple to beat will be its fiscal second-quarter revenue in 2016   of $50.6 billion. Anything less than this figure would mean the   tech giant expects to return to year-over-year decline.Can this tech giant keep up its momentum?For Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday,   Feb. 1, investors will also likely be honing in on the company's   reported revenue, though expectations for Facebook's growth are   far more optimistic than what investors expect from Apple these   days. While it's unrealistic to expect Facebook to report the   same 56% year-over-year revenue growth it reported in Q3 given   the company's tough year-ago comparison of 44% year-over-year   revenue growth, investors will likely look for any deceleration   in revenue growth to be modest. I'll be looking for   fourth-quarter revenue growth of about 45%.Image source: Amazon.Beyond Facebook's revenue growth, another area that could move   the stock is the company's reported user metrics. While any   surprises on user metrics are unlikely considering the company's   consistent upward march in monthly active users and user   engagement, a sudden pullback in user growth or engagement could   spook some investors. Investors should look for the social   network's monthly active users to increase about three to four   percent sequentially and its user engagement, or daily active   users as a percentage of monthly active users, to be 66% or   better -- figures that would maintain recent user performance   trends.Can holiday sales live up to big expectations?Going into Amazon's Feb. 2 fourth-quarter report, management   didn't provide a very narrow guidance range for expected revenue   growth. Amazon said it expected revenue to increase anywhere   between 17% to 27% year over year. This wide range for potential   net sales growth for the quarter will likely have many investors   watching the important holiday quarter's revenue.Analysts are betting Amazon's sales for the quarter will fall   at the high end of management's guidance, according to analyst   estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. On average, analysts are   expecting net sales of $44.7 billion, up 25% year over year.If any of these companies under- or over-perform these   expectations by a meaningful margin, these high-profile stocks   could make big moves. But investors should put any moves into the   context of the companies' broader, big-picture performance and   their long-term potential; the market often leans toward   shortsightedness and can overreact to news. Still, any   significant deviation reported from these key metrics would   likely require some further analysis.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great Recession;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheS&P 500has more than tripled since it hit its low point of the Great Recession on March 9, 2009. There were plenty of stocks to buy back then that offered incredible value. For investors that weren't old enough or didn't have the resources to invest back then, it may seem like you've missed the boat. After all, the old investing adage is to buy low and sell high.makeArticleAd();Source:PixabayAlmost every stock worth owning has a much higher share price now than it did on the day the S&P 500 bottomed in 2009, but just because share prices were lower back in 2009 doesn't necessarily mean that buyers were getting a better deal.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAs the stock market has risen, so have corporate earnings. Even though investors are now paying more for each share of stock, they are also getting more earnings bang for their buck. Here's a look at three stocks that are a better value today than they were on March 9, 2009.Stocks to Buy: Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS)Source:Erik DrostGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) was right in the eye of the Great Recession storm. The company even received a $10 billion bailout from the government during the meltdown.In the years since the crisis, new regulations and capital requirements severely hindered bank earnings. For GS stock, the heaviest weight has been the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule is a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that prevents banks from performing certain types of speculative trading.Despite the regulatory headwinds, GS has found a way to ramp up its earnings in recent years. Goldman's net income is up more than 180% since 2009, making GS stock an even better value today than it was back then. Goldman's current price-to-earnings ratio is only 14.2, 19% lower than it was on March 9, 2009.Looking ahead,  Donald Trump has pledged to eliminate many of the regulations that have been holding back the big banks. Goldman stock is in an even better position and it is a better value today than it was in the years following the Great Recession.Stocks to Buy: Visa Inc (V)Source:K rlis Dambr ns via FlickrThe market forVisa Inc(NYSE:V) is dramatically changing. While mobile competition fromPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others may certainly disrupt the traditional payment business, Visa should be just fine. A recentBI Intelligencereport concluded that merchant service providers (MSPs) are much more threatened by mobile payment competition than the credit card companies themselves.The proof is in the pudding. Even with the emergence of platforms like Apple Pay, Visa's profits have exploded more than 400% since 2009. BMO Capital analystPaulo Ribeiroexpects Visa's double-digit earnings growth to continue in the long-term. He believes V stock will continue to benefit from the slow death of cash and check payments.7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeEven though V stock has been a top performer in the market since the Great Recession, that incredible earnings growth means Visa's P/E ratio is down 60% from where it was when the market bottomed in 2009. In other words, V stock is a much better value today than it was back then.Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRK.B)Source:Pete Souza via Wikimedia (Modified)If you're looking for stocks to buy in the market today that would make 2009 investors envious, it doesn't get much better thanBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). The holding company of the most iconic and successful value investor of all time is currently trading at a better value than it was during the Great Recession.Warren Buffett's BRK.B stock now has a P/E of 17, which is down roughly 21% since March 9, 2009. Buffett and Berkshire have done very well since the Great Recession. But thanks to BRK.B's 823% income growth, investors now get a better value for Berkshire shares than they did at the market bottom.If anyone can find value in the stock market after it climbs 235% in eight years, it's the Oracle of Omaha. Instead of losing sleep over stocks to buy with the market at an all-time high, why not just invest in Buffett? Unlike high school, there's no penalty for cheating off of the smart kid's paper.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great Recessionappeared first onInvestorPlace."
6 Reasons Why Investors Should Take A Bite Into Apple;1/30/2017;"Apple, Inc. (AAPL) is expected to revert towards the growth curve during the December quarter of 2016 after a drop in the previous three quarters which led to its first ever full-year decline of sales in a decade. However, as the technology giant prepares to announce its quarterly earnings, the invisible cloud of over-expectation is bound to envelop its stock.Here’s a closer look at the iPhone maker and why investors should consider taking a bite into Apple.1. Strong FundamentalsmakeArticleAd();Although Apple’s FY2016 revenue witnessed some decline, raising discussions over its growth and innovation story, its fundamentals remain intact. Apple maintains a healthy operating margin and in-control debt structure with its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling a whopping $237.58 billion at the end of FY2016. With a projected revenue between $76 billion and $78 billion during Q1 FY2017, Apple should make a smooth bounce back, both sequentially as well as year-on-year.2. RepatriationWhile Apple is cash rich, 90% of it is held by its foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. to avoid the heavy taxation on repatriation. Now, with Donald Trump as U.S. President, there is the possibility that a one-time tax of 10% on repatriation may be levied to encourage companies to bring back trillions of dollars of money to the American soil.More than a decade back, a similar one-time tax holiday on repatriation was provided under the Homeland Investment Act of 2004. Apaperanalyzing companies during that period points out that “repatriations were associated with significantly higher levels of shareholder payouts, mainly through share repurchases” reflecting good governance and financial health of the U.S. multi-national corporations.If such a tax rebate is provided again, investors could benefit directly in the form of share buybacks and dividend payouts. If that isn’t the case, such repatriation may be directed towards increasing domestic investment, employment and R&D which would boost growth and hence benefit investors indirectly.3. ServicesWhile the iPhone continues to be the biggest revenue generator among all of Apple’s products, its services segment has seen an impressive growth in recent quarters. Apple’s services include revenue from Internet services (such as Apple Music, iTunes, and the App Store), iCloud, AppleCare, ApplePay, licensing, and other services. Services is emerging as an important segment of Apple’s revenue stream and is likely to grow stronger as its ecosystem of more than one billion devices expands further.4. Profit ShareAs the global smartphone market is moving towards stabilized long term growth, low-priced smartphones are becoming popular, especially in emerging markets. Thistrendhas notably weighed on Apple’s shipments which are sold much above the average selling price for smartphones.However, despite all odds, Apple still captured 91% share of all smartphone operating profit worldwide during Q3 2016 as per areport. Further, as 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of iPhone’s debut, there is great excitement building around its next iPhone model.“The iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come,”saidTim Cook, Apple’s CEO.5. Research & DevelopmentApple is known for keeping its projects under wraps, however, its increased spending on research and development, from $4.5 billion in 2013 to $10 billion in 2016, displays its commitment to innovate and evolve new technology that enhances and expands its existing product range.Apple is now focusing on advanced technological areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, and automation. In aletterto NHTSA dated November, 2016, Apple wrote, “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Further, Apple recentlyjoinedAmazon, Facebook, Google/DeepMind, IBM, and Microsoft to become a founding member of thePartnership on AI.6. DividendApple’squarterly dividendhas risen gradually since 2012. The company has paid $2.49 billion, $10.56 billion, $11.12 billion, $11.56 billion and $12.15 billion as dividends and equivalents during 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Although its current quarterly dividend is small at $0.57 per share, it acts as a sweetener considering that the company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis.Final WordAs the largest company in terms of market capitalization and world’smost valuablebrand, investors and analysts alike follow Apple closely, reacting to news concerning the technology giant. While some decline in the market share is bound to occur with rising competition in the smartphone space (especially against low-cost devices), Apple’s brand appeal and customer loyalty remain intact.Apple is investing in technologies of the future that would open newer revenue streams and is committed to bring innovative products in the market. A healthy balance sheet, decent growth numbers, regular dividend and less volatile stock movement make Apple a healthy pick for an investor’s portfolio. Its shares are up by 28% over the last one year and 5.27% year-to-date, which mean that investors have already factored in decent numbers during its upcoming earnings report on January 31, 2017.The author has no position in any stocks mentioned.Investors should consider the above information not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration."
Apple Inc. Gets Extra Help From the Dual Camera iPhone 7 Plus (AAPL);1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) first introduced its new, big and bigger smartphones - the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - the company opted to offer a few minor features for buyers of the largest model. The 6 Plus had longer battery life, and an image stabilized camera. That basic strategy continued with the 6s Plus in 2015. But last year with the iPhone 7 Plus, AAPL included a more significant carrot in the signature Dual Camera feature.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThe move of making a key feature exclusive to its larger phones appears to have paid off with a big increase in iPhone 7 Plus sales compared to regular iPhone 7 sales.Having more of the costlier iPhone 7 Plus models in the mix means AAPL can generate more revenue, even if overall unit sales are soft.Differentiating Between Big and BiggerHistorically, the larger-sized iPhone hasn't sold nearly as well as the ""standard"" 4.7-inch model.When AAPL first introduced the two model strategy in 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus had an immediate bump in demand from Apple fans who were hungry for a phablet. It was also very popular in Asian markets, where phablets, which can take the place of both smartphone and tablet, are often preferred. However, overall the bigger and more expensive iPhone 6 Plus only accounted foraround 20% of overall iPhone salesglobally.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIn 2015, AAPL added a little more appeal to the bigger iPhone, adding increased RAM to the optically image stabilized camera for the iPhone 6 Plus. However, that saw just a small uptick in sales of the bigger model.Last year, Apple rolled the dice: It decided to release a dual camera smartphone, a premium upgrade that it heavily promoted as a must-have feature. With this advanced camera system, users could take DSLR-like portraits and optically zoom in on subjects. AAPL made this key feature an iPhone 7 Plus exclusive, at the same time boosting the price of its larger iPhone. Previously, it had charged $649 and $749 respectively for the two sizes. In 2016, the company still started the iPhone 7 at $649, but to get the dual camera smartphone feature required shelling out at least $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.iPhone 7 Sales See Big Increase in iPhone 7 Plus AdoptionTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus strategy appears to have paid off. Citing numbers from Cowen & Co. UBS, Cowen and Creative Strategies Inc., theWSJsays that in AAPL's first quarter (ending in December), theiPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for 40% of total iPhone 7 sales, globally.Breaking the numbers down regionally, it's estimated that 52% of Chinese iPhone buyers opted for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, while in the U.S. it accounted for 47% of total iPhone 7 sales.Why Increased iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 7 Sales MatterThe difference between the two iPhone models is material to AAPL's bottom line.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)It's likely that the iPhone 7 Plus costs Apple more to manufacture than previous Plus versions - it does have more RAM, a larger battery and that dual camera system - but at least some of the additional cost is offset by the boost from $749 to $769.The profit margin for Apple on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus probably remains roughly the same. However, with a base price that's $120 higher, having more Plus models in the mix means that even if overall iPhone 7 sales are soft, the average selling price of a new iPhone goes up. As a result, iPhone revenue could get a boost, despite sales that may not meet expectations.And, as theWSJarticle points out, there's another positive point for AAPL in the iPhone 7 Plus numbers. The fact that pricing the iPhone 7 Plus so high still resulted in big gains for the premium smartphone bodes well for later this year when the company will release the10th anniversary iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 sales numbers indicate that AAPL has additional room to price the iPhone 8 as an ultra-premium, special edition model if it chooses.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

3 Earnings Reports You Need to Watch This Week;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe markets started last week off hot, but ended with a couple slight down days thanks to the one-two punch of not-so-hot corporate earnings and worse-than-expected GDP growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockStill, despite the softness, theS&P 500has enjoyed a more or less steady upward trend over the past year or so, tallying around 20% gains over the past 12 months. And there are plenty of individual stocks that could break the downtrend.For instance,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) andUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA) are all reporting their latest quarterly numbers this week - and all investors should be paying attention.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatLet's take a look at what's in store for these picks.Earnings to Watch:Apple (AAPL)Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrApple, which has more or less risen in tandem with the S&P 500 over the past year, will report earnings on Tuesday after the market close.The tech giant is looking to notch its third straight earnings beat-although a beat would still translate to an earnings decline. Wall Street is expecting $3.22 per share compared to last year's $3.28 per share, and that fall is despite expectations for a slight uptick in revenue.Apple has suffered several straight quarters of falling sales, but analysts expect a strong holiday season driven by the iPhone 7 to return the company to organic growth. Even if that growth is meager and earnings shrink slightly, I expect investors to be pleased.Remember, Apple is no longer the growth darling it once was. But 20% gains over the last year plus a solid dividend make a pretty strong case for the stock. I think investors will be reminded of the new Apple's appeal when earnings are released tomorrow.Earnings to Watch:Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrAdvanced Micro Devices is another company that doesn't have too much growth in its near-term forecast despite sales growth. Oftentimes, companies fail to grow sales, but still manage to grow earnings thanks to cost savings or accounting tricks.But in the case of AMD, the loss per share is expected to be a penny worse than it was a year ago due to higher costs and despite double-digit sales growth.The pain isn't expected to end after this quarter either; the full-year earnings forecast is also in the red. But I do like AMD's long-term prospects, as it's introduced new products and inked new partnerships and deals, including one withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayIf AMD happens to get battered after its earnings report Tuesday, I wouldn't hesitate to buy some shares on the cheap.Earnings to Watch:Under Armour (UAA)Source: ShutterstockUnder Armour is the only stock on this list that has earnings growth on-tap for the current quarter. And while the 4% growth Wall Street expects isn't that mind-blowing, it's a fraction of the growth that's expected down the road.Full-year earnings are expected to enjoy 13% year-over-year growth, while the five-year average is expected to top 20%. Meanwhile, sales growth is also expected to come in north of 20% and stay there in quarters to come.So far, UAA stock has been battling some headwinds: Shares are currently right at their 50-day moving average and are under the 200-day. A good earnings report could be the catalyst needed to turn that long-term average to a floor instead of a ceiling.Under Armour stock also reports on Tuesday.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

What to Expect When Cirrus Logic Inc. Reports Earnings This Wednesday;1/30/2017;"Image Source: Cirrus LogicWhen audio codec supplierCirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) releases its fiscal 2017 third quarter results on   Feb. 1, investors can expect another period of rapid growth from   the company. Cirrus Logic has benefited fromApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) decision to remove the headphone jack from the   latest generation of iPhones, leading to strong sales of its   wireless headset solutions. This should drive a strong quarterly   performance at Cirrus, but the company's over-dependence on Apple   for 78% of its revenue could be a deal-breaker as far as the   broad investor outlook is concerned.makeArticleAd();Apple will drive strong growth for Cirrus in the third     quarter . . .Cirrus expects to post third quarter revenue of $475 million   to $515 million with a gross margin of 48%. The midpoint of this   guidance puts its year-over-year growth at an impressive 42%,   which is not surprising given the content gains that Cirrus has   witnessed in the iPhone 7.A teardown of the latest smartphone by Chipworks revealed that   the device uses three audio amplifiers from Cirrus, as compared   to two in the iPhone 6S. Now, the actual device is not the only   place where Cirrus is going to make money. iFixit's X-ray of the   Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter, used to connect legacy headphones to   the iPhone 7, reveals the presence of audio codecs from Cirrus as   well.What's more, Cirrus has also supplied digital-to-analog   converter chips for the Lightning EarPods, according to a   teardown of the device by the Vietnamese site Tinhte. All of this   indicates that Cirrus has received a serious bump in its chip   content at Apple. In fact, Pacific Crest Securities forecasts   additional content gains of $2.50 for Cirrus Logic with the   iPhone 7, including the Lightning EarPods and the second stereo   speaker.Encouraged by the booming business, Cirrus seems to have   directed most of its manufacturing capacity toward making chips   for the iPhone and related accessories. This is why revenue from   its largest customer shot up to 78% of total sales in the July to   September quarter, when iPhone production was being ramped up, as   compared to 63% in the year-ago period.iPhone orders from suppliers for the December quarter   reportedly stood at 89 million units. Now, the iPhone 7 and 7   Plus won't account for 100% of Apple's device sales. To provide   some perspective, sales of these two models reportedly made up   72% of total iPhone sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter,   according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.Assuming that 72% of the 89 million iPhone unit orders Apple   placed in the fourth quarter were for the two new devices, that   would account for approximately 64 million units. Multiplying   this estimated unit count by additional content gains of $2.50   for each device, Cirrus revenue would increase by $160 million   from the prior-year period when it reported total revenue of $348   million.This alone puts Cirrus revenue at about $508 million for the   fiscal third quarter, which falls at the higher end of its   guidance range. But apart from the dollar content gains,   Cirrus will also benefit from the production of an additional   nine million iPhone units as compared to the Dec. 2015 quarter,   when estimated volume stood at 80 million. Therefore, Cirrus is   poised to outperform even the higher end of its guidance   range.. . . but hurt its longer term outlookHowever, Cirrus Logic's outlook could prove to be a problem as   iPhone production in the first calendar quarter of 2017 is   expected to decline to about 42 million units, as indicated by aUBSreport. Earlier, Apple was expected to produce 43 million iPhones   during the period, but it has reportedly downsized production in   order to avoid an inventory glut.Assuming the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus maintain a 72% share of   overall production, these two devices will account for   approximately 30 million units in the current quarter. With the   $2.50 per unit of additional content, the new devices will add   $75 million to Cirrus' top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.To factor in the lower production volume, iPhone builds in the   year-ago quarter stood at an estimated 55 million units. This   puts the anticipated year-over-year decline in volume at 13   million units. Assuming that the production cut pertains to the   older iPhone 6S, Cirrus' revenue could drop by as much as $45   million since it was making $3.50 on each unit of the prior   generation device.Therefore, the revenue gains from the iPhone 7 will be reduced   to just $30 million after accounting for the decline in overall   production. This indicates that Cirrus could post sales of   approximately $262 million in the fiscal fourth quarter as its   revenue in the prior-year period was $232 million. Barring major   gains in other business areas, Wall Street analyst estimates   of between $312 million and $350 million in fiscal fourth   quarter revenue will be tough to beat.This tough outlook could lead to a potential sell-off since   investors will consider booking profits as Cirrus Logic shares   have already doubled in the past year.

Plenty of Grist for the Market Mill This Week;1/30/2017;"Monday, January 30, 2017makeArticleAd();Plenty of grist for the mill of the markets this week, including Personal Income & Spending today, news from the Bank of Japan's policy meeting tomorrow, news from the latest Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday, and, of course, the heart of Q4 earnings season. For a comprehensive account of these and many more events this week, check out Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank's latest Global Market Ahead:4 Good Reasons to Focus on the USAPersonal Income & Spending showed a gap of 2 percentage points: income grew 0.3% in December (analysts had expected 0.4%) while spending ran hotter at 0.5%. Income in November was revised from unchanged to +0.1%. Because we're talking about fractions of percentage points, none of this is extremely ""newsy"" at the moment, although in aggregate over time we may see some patterns emerging, and of course we'd prefer to see incomes rise as much as spending, if possible.No big names are reporting earnings until ExxonMobilXOMTuesday morning and AppleAAPLafter the bell tomorrow, although we will hear from a couple Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) companies like BofI HoldingBOFIand Heritage OaksHEOP. Other big firms like FacebookFBand AmazonAMZNwill report later in the week.It will be interesting to see how the market interprets - if it decides to interpret - events developing out of the White House over the weekend, including an executive order from President Trump to ban Muslim citizens from the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The Trump Rally had been priced for perfection, after all, and abrupt actions such as these often have a way of seeing the markets hit the brakes a bit.Of course, the market may instead simply focus on the here and now: the proposed tax cuts and deregulation should still provide a windfall for publicly traded companies, if not in the immediate term then sometime down the road. But the divisiveness that appears to be promoted by President Trump may add a new wrinkle into the proceedings. Market futures are down in the pre-market: S&P 500 -7.5, Dow -58 and Nasdaq -16.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Can Apple (AAPL) be a Suitable Value Pick at the Moment?;1/30/2017;"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?makeArticleAd();One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's putApple Inc.AAPLstock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Apple has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.75. This level compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.11.If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Apple's current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. Hence, this does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its own historical trend.Meanwhile, the stock's PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer & Technology sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.08. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Apple has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 13.70, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead forApple stockin the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Apple has a P/S ratio of about 3.05. This is a bit higher than the Computer & Technology sector's average, which comes in at 2.96 right now. In fact, over the last year, Apple's figure has been quite close to the sector's average, as we can see in the chart below:However, the current level lies near to the median of the stock's own historical trend (which stands at 2.93). This again does not provide us with any conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its own trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Apple currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Apple a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Apple is just 1.20, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 5.06. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, AAPL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Apple might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'D' and a Momentum score of 'F'. This gives AAPL a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'D'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scoreshere >>)Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards slightly. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and eight downward revisions in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 0.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined nearly 2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteThis somewhat dull trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineApple forms a part of the Zacks Computer-Mini industry. The industry is highly competitive and thus Apple faces significant competition in most of its operating markets from respective segment leaders like Hewlett-Packard, Google, Samsung, etc. Moreover, the demand for high-end devices has been soft recently, owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially with currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe.In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Computer-Mini industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Apple is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 14% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn bullish in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today's most promising long-term stocks?

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Intel;1/30/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 30, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) andIntel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This QuarterAnalysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) for one has strongly resisted government demands as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report). Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report); networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Will It Continue?Corporate earnings have started growing again, with growth in the ongoing Q4 earnings season on track to reach its highest level in 8 quarters. Growth is still modest - the Q4 earnings growth is currently on track to reach +5.2% and the final growth tally for the quarter will at best be a couple of percentage points higher. But this is still a notable improvement over what we were experiencing in the recent past.Please recall that earnings growth turned positive only in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters.Positive surprises, particularly on the earnings front, are tracking below other historical periods at this stage. We will see if this trend continues this week as we enter the heart of the earnings season, with more 400 companies coming out with quarterly results, including 106 S&P 500 members.Q4 Scorecard(as of January 27, 2017)We have crossed the one-third mark in the Q4 reporting cycle, with results from 170 S&P 500 members, or 33.9% of the index's total membership, already out. Total earnings for these 170 index members are up +6.0% on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.1% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The Q4 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 170 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises are tracking on the low side at this stage, particularly on the earnings front. The 64.1% proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS estimates compares to 81.2% in the preceding quarter, 76.3% as the 4-quarter average and 72.2% as the 12-quarter average. Positive revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of companies in Q3, but are roughly in-line with historical periods.Standout SectorsSectors with strong growth and better than expected results include the Finance, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Positive surprises for all of these sectors are tracking above the index level.Finance: With results from 57.7% of the sector's market cap in the S&P 500 index already out, total earnings for the sector are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with +66.7% beating EPS estimates and +46.2% beating top-line estimates.This is a better growth performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent periods. Please note that positive surprises are as hard to come by in the Finance sector as they are elsewhere.Strong Finance sector growth is a big driver of the aggregate growth performance for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 growth pace still compares favorably with other recent periods, but a lot less so.Technology: For the Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 59.6% of the sector's total market cap. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 82.8% beating revenue estimates.We will see what this week'sApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) andFacebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) reports bring, but the sector's Q4 earnings and revenue growth is about in-line with what we saw from this same group of Tech companies in the preceding quarter (2016 Q3), though it is notably tracking above the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages. With respect to positive surprises, Tech companies appear to be beating EPS estimates at a lower proportion than has historically been the case, though the proportion of positive earnings surprises remains above the index level. Revenue surprises, on the other hand, are tracking notably above historical periods.Key Reports for the Week of January 30thTuesday - 1/31/2017: Monday has a relatively light reporting docket, but Tuesday is very busy with more than 90 companies reporting results, including 33 S&P 500 members (of which 22 are in the morning). The focus will be on Apple, which reports after the market's close.Exxon(NYSE:XOM-Free Report) will be a key report in the morning.Apple is expected to report $3.22 in earnings on $76.2 billion in revenues, which compare to $3.28 on $75.9 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock is up +9.7% since November 8th vs. +7% for the S&P 500 index and +6.1% for the Zacks Technology sector. December quarter estimates have been stable in recent days, though they have come down for the March quarter.Wednesday - 2/01/2017: Facebook is the most high profile of the 27 index members reporting results today (it will report after the market's close). The focus will be on the social media giant's ad revenues and daily active users, but the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate is $1.13 on $8.4 billion in revenues. This compares to EPS of $0.59 on $5.8 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have modestly inched up in recent days. The stock has performed in-line with the Zacks Tech sector since November 8th, up +6.3% vs. +6.1%.Thursday - 2/02/2017: On a busy reporting day with 35 index members coming out with Q4 results (23 in the morning & 12 after the market's close), the most notable report is fromAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) in the evening.Amazon is expected to report $1.41 in earnings (up +41.5% year over year) on $44.8 billion in revenues (up +25.4% in revenues). Estimates have come down ahead of the earnings report, but Amazon has never really been an EPS story; it is all top-line growth, particularly gains in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. Amazon has staked a well-regarded claim to leadership in the fast-growing cloud business. The stock has been a strong performer over the past year, up +31.4% vs. +12.4% gain for the Zacks Retail sector.Note:Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

What's In Store for Apple ETFs This Earnings?;1/30/2017;"Technology giant AppleAAPLis set to release first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on January 31 after market close. Since Apple accounts for over 19% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector in the S&P 500 index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of results (read:5 ETF Investment Ideas for 2017).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Investors should note that Apple has been on an uptrend over the past three months, locking in gains of about 11%. In fact, the stock is currently within the striking distance of its 52-week high of $122.44. The upside might weaken as our proven model shows that the company has a lower probability of beating estimates this quarter. Additionally, the positive earnings estimate revision trend, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat, is absent for the stock.Inside Our MethodologyThe stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past seven days or 30 days. Though AAPL's earnings surprise history is strong with a positive earnings surprise of 0.11% on average in the past four quarters, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and anEarnings ESPof -0.93% indicating lower chances of beating estimates this quarter (read:Bartosiak: Trading Apple's (AAPL) Earnings with Options).Betting on stocks that have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) usually leads to profits in an investor's portfolio. Our research shows that the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70% for the stocks with this combination. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP FilterFurther, the stock has an ugly Industry Rank in the bottom 14% with an unimpressive Growth and Momentum Style Score of D and F, respectively, though a Value Style Score of B looks good. According to the analysts compiled by Zacks, Apple has an average target price of $132.10 with about 77% of the analysts having a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of its earnings. This indicates an 8.3% upside to the current price of AAPL.What's Hot This Earnings Season?Apple had recorded its first annual revenue and profit decline in 15 years last fiscal year due to the saturation of the smartphone market. In addition, iPhone sales declined in the trailing three quarters. Analysts are expecting this trend to reverse with growth in both revenue and iPhone sales when it reports quarterly results (read:Will Q4 Earnings Strengthen Tech ETFs Further?).In fact, Apple is expected to have sold78 million iPhonesin first-quarter fiscal 2017, up from 75 million in the year-ago quarter, with revenues rising to $77.9 billion.As such, sales of the iPhone remained the major driver in the upcoming earnings report that will push up the stock price.ETFs on RadarGiven the above discussion, it is clear that sales is the most important metric this reporting cycle and that an earnings beat might be in store. As a result, investors' could definitely focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan.While there are several ETFs in the space having Apple in their top 10 holdings, we have highlighted four funds that have Apple as their top firm. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or 'Buy' rating with a Medium risk outlook (see:all the Technology ETFs here):iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETFIYW- The fund is up about 8% over the past three months and Apple makes up for 16.1% of the assets.Select Sector SPDR Technology ETFXLK- The fund added more than 7% in the same time frame and Apple accounts for 13.7% share.Vanguard Information Technology ETFVGT- It surged about 7.6%.

Finally, online retailing giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) joins the fray after the close on Thursday.Facebook Inc (FB)FB stock saw a wellspring of call option activity on Friday at a time when many traders were seeking protection ahead of the weekend. Total volume on the stock rose to 755,000 contracts, with calls snapping up an impressive 71% of the day's take.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Call buying was the order of the day, as traders appear to be anticipating a post-earnings rally from Facebook this Wednesday.Following Friday's close, the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio slipped from 0.82 at the beginning of the session to 0.75 as calls were added at a faster rate than puts among options most affected by Facebook's quarterly report - implying rising expectations for a bullish post-earnings move. Implieds are still pricing in a move of about 5.3% for FB stock, with the upper bound lying at roughly $139.50 and the lower bound resting at $125.50.For the record, Facebook earnings are expected to rise nearly 66% to $1.31 per share, with sales soaring 45.4% to $8.49 billion. According toEarningsWhispers.com, the whisper number for Facebook's fourth-quarter comes in at $1.37 per share.Apple Inc (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is also on tap to release its quarterly report this week. Analysts are expecting a year-over-year decline of about 2% for Apple earnings, down to $3.22 per share from $3.28 per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to creep 2% higher to $77.38 billion.Even speculative analysts remain reserved on Apple, asEarningsWhispers.comreports a whisper number of only $3.23 per share. That said, iPhone unit sales and guidance amid the current geopolitical climate could be the major drivers for any post-earnings reaction for AAPL stock.As such, options traders appear to be playing it close to the vest on AAPL. Friday's activity revealed a bit of trepidation, with calls accounting for a below-average 58% of the 637,000 contracts traded on Apple stock. The 3 Feb. options series also shows a bit of concern for AAPL's earnings reaction, with the put/call OI ratio coming in at 0.74, slightly above Apple's historic pre-earnings range nearer 0.70. Furthermore, peak 3 Feb. call OI rests at the in-the-money $120 strike, hinting at low expectations for AAPL stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Last, but certainly not least, Amazon.com will release its fourth-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday, and it looks like evenI underestimated AMZN stock's potential. Several retailers have already reported this quarter, blaming lower-than-expected sales figures on slowing foot traffic, mainly due to the rising dominance of online shopping - a market in which Amazon commands38% of the market share.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsStill, AMNZ options traders appeared reluctant to jump on the bullish bandwagon on Friday. Total volume rose to 247,000 contracts, with calls only eking out 58% of the day's take.That said, peak call OI for the 3 Feb series totals 1,300 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $900 strike, with another 1,200 contracts at the $870 strike. So, while volume remains a touch conservative, AMZN options traders still appear to have high expectations for a post-earnings rally.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc.

(AAPL)Apple is in the midst of a controversial move that will limit the number of apps available to consumers in Iran.The company has reportedlybeen pulling Iranian appsfrom the App Store. The App Store was first opened in the Middle Eastern country a few months ago in September 2016.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayAt first, there were numerous restrictions governing the Store, but Apple was slowly removing these. However, a credible tech news site calledTechrasasaid an popular Iranian e-commerce service Digikala hadits app removed from the App Store.The app had more than a million users. One fact worth noting is that there is no official App Store for the territory of Iran, but many companies manage to sell their apps to consumers in Iran by registering their app as being outside the country.The country has about 40 million smartphones in use, which amounts to roughly half of the 82 million population using devices.AAPL shares have risen 5.3% year-to-date.BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)BlackBerry is looking for one last hurrah in the smartphone industry with its Mercury device.The company has managed to survive going under by slowly transitioning from a hardware maker to a software provider. While the Mercuryisn't even technically manufactured by BlackBerry,the company still had a hand in the creation of device.The gadget recentlymade an appearanceinLast Man Standing, anABCsitcom starring Tim Allen.

BlackBerry's latest smartphone will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month.Allen is a fan of the company's phones, but it is unclear if the decision to use it on the show was his idea or a decision made by one of the producers.BBRY shares have slipped 5.4% over the past six months.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) enters this week's fourth-quarter earnings report in a peculiar position: Despite the fact that FB stock is trading near all-time highs, Facebook absolutely has something to prove.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's because FB has spent the past three months recovering from a rough Q3 report that sent the stock to one of its biggest dips since coming public in 2012. While the company reported a strong earnings beat, Facebook CFO warned about a slowdown in revenue growth for Q4, and said ad load might ""come down meaningfully"" in the second half of this year.The news sparked a selloff from which Facebook wouldn't really recover until the start of 2017. But recover it has - FB stock is up roughly 15% in the past month to trade near all-time highs around $113.So, what's in store for Facebook this time around?If you believe Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald, FB could be sitting on the powder keg that sends Facebook through the price ceiling.Fitzgerald believes Instagram and mobile ad revenues will drive the business forward, and expects Q4 revenues to grow 46% year-over-year to $8.54 billion - slightly ahead of Wall Street's broader estimates for $8.5 billion. He also projects GAAP profits of $1.05, which are a penny higher than the consensus mark.""We remain particularly optimistic around Instagram, bottom-funnel ad units like DPAs, and Live video,"" says Fitzgerald, whose $175 price target represents 33% upside from here. ""While expense growth is a potential concern, FB has a history of under-promising and overdelivering in this area.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIndeed, mobile is king for Facebook, which crossed the 1 billion mark for ""mobile only"" active users in Q3. In fact, 84% of the company's $6.82 billion in ad revenues came from mobile - up from 78% in the year-ago period. At about $5.7 billion, mobile ad sales came in more than 30% higher thantotalFacebook ad sales in Q3 2015.Still, if Facebook matches Wall Street's projections for 45.6% sales growth, that would be down both sequentially from Q3's 59% revenue expansion, and last Q4's 52% increase in sales. Which means investors will be looking for other areas of growth.They could get it in Facebook Live, the company's somewhat controversial live streaming service that has unwittingly exposed users to real-time torture and suicide videos. Still, CEO believes images and video are the future of Facebook - and the expansion and advertising of Live's services reflect that plenty.Facebook will need to show Wall Street something exciting, though, or FB could be in for its second straight quarterly tumble.Facebook shares reached all-time highs just above $133 in late October. They then dropped but rebounded to the $132 area, but were rejected following the Q3 earnings report. FB then was sent packing to the $114 level, which it fought several times before rebounding into the current rally.Now, Facebook stock finds itself challenging the $132-$133 area once more, but this time with an overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading in the low 70s.And from a fundamental perspective, Facebook's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 isn't nearly on par with the likes of pricey Big Tech stocks such asNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), but it's still a little lofty.At the very least, it'll be on investors' minds - especially if Facebook lays an egg Wednesday.More Earnings in FocusApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Jan. 31:When Apple reports fiscal Q1 earnings this Tuesday, Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to finally snap its short streak of consecutive revenue declines with a small 2% uptick in sales. Earnings, however, are expected to shrink slightly, by about 2% to $3.22 per share. Naturally, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be in focus - Q1 covers the holiday season, which typically accounts for the year's biggest chunk of the iPhone revenue pie.However, Macquarie Capital's Ben Schachter thinks Services - which includes the App Store and AppleCare -might be the star of this show:""The oft underestimated and misunderstood Services segment has the potential to drive ~100 bps [=1%] of overall gross margin expansion per year for Apple. However, if one believes that iPhone units can grow with iPhone 8 and then be roughly stable going forward, we believe Services and Apps will become the growth engine for Apple.""Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Feb. 2:Amazon, on the other hand, is expected to keep up its torrid growth numbers when it reports Q4 earnings on Thursday. Profits are expected to improve by 35% to $1.35 per share, while revenues should surge 25% to $44.67 billion. Numerous brick-and-mortar retailers reported difficult holiday seasons, hinting at more gains for the ubiquitous e-tailer.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsAlso promising is a note from Cowen analyst John Blackledge, who says Prime has ""maintained healthy growth."" He pointed toward a Cowen survey suggesting that Amazon Prime's customer base has grown 22% year-over-year to 50 million.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Reclaim Its Throne;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has its day of reckoning fast approaching. Tim Cook has turned out to be a game manager for AAPL stock. That's not a slight against him, but a game manager comes in when your first-string QB is out for a quarter or two. The problem is that Apple needs a visionary. There's no replacing Steve Jobs, and being a game manager in a sector that moves like lightning is not what the company needs.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrAAPL stock generates almost 70% of revenue from the iPhone, and that product is seeing increasing competition.The good news is that Apple has well over $200 billion in cash and investments. It can literally do anything it wants. The problem is that most of that cash is stuck overseas - although that may change under Trump - and what Cook might do with that cash is a mystery.Without a vision, Apple would probably have to make acquisitions in rapidly growing companies. However, there is one other area that AAPL stock can venture into, one that I've been saying it must get into: original content.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018News has surfaced that AAPL is finally looking seriously at creating original TV and film content. For years, Apple has begged off of this direction. It seemed content to play around with music streaming, and licensing content from other providers for iTunes.TheWSJreported:""The technology giant has been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs. It also has approached experienced marketing executives at studios and networks to discuss hiring them to promote its content, said people with knowledge of the discussions. In addition to TV, Apple indicated to these people that it is considering offering original movies, though those plans are more preliminary. Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017.""The apple is ripe for AAPL to get involved, and in a very big way. We've seen thatNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has shifted its model toward original programming and is producing really great stuff. So isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). YouTube Red, though, is kind of floundering right now.One thing people want is not only more content, but good content. Because Apple is so flush with cash, it can literally do anything in this arena. There is a ton of talent out there, and so many models to play with for AAPL stock.Obviously, Apple would want to create high quality TV and film, and could do so across all genres. It wouldn't even have to be an issue of streaming content alone. If Apple wanted, it could produce feature films, and buy out any of the existing movie theatre chains and rebrand it as an Apple Theatre experience, and drop in all manner of synergies like this.The concept of the ""long tail"" is still very much in play, so creating independent work for a price, or returning to a version of the old studio system might also yield rewards. Yet there are other models, such as mining new talent from film schools and user-generated genius that's all over the place.The emerging technology of VR is another place to stretch. The ability to curate fully engaging experiences via VR, and developing technology that allows players to wear bodysuits permitting them to actually experience touch in these games is the next frontier.Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?And Apple has the money for it. It could become a multi-platform creator of content, and be able to engage people from all over the world.Is this is a blockbuster revenue generator for Apple stock? It's way too early to tell. However, having a vision that extends the concept of ""content"" to things like VR and more ""experiential"" content, could mean becoming the first mover in a whole new generation of entertainment. That is priceless.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter. As of this writing, has no position in any stock mentioned.

LM Ericsson Sets Sail With a New Captain;1/30/2017;"Telecom-equipment makerTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(NASDAQ: ERIC) reported fourth-quarter results on Thursday   morning.

Financial results reported in Swedish crowns, converted to   average exchange rates of $0.11 USD per SEK in Q4 of 2016 and   $0.12 USD per SEK in the 2015 period.What happened with Ericsson this quarter?This was a tumultuous quarter for the Swedish telecom   infrastructure veteran.Borje Ekholm took the CEO office shortly after the end of     the fourth quarter. Interim CEO Jan Frykhammar stepped down,     but will remain on Ericsson's board of directors. Frykhammar's     team of advisors, including interim CFO Carl Mellander and     executive vice president Magnus Mandersson, will stay in place     to give Ekholm guidance and continuity. That's the end of the     aftermath of former CEO Hans Vestberg's seven-year reign.A large chunk of the sales decline came from a tough     comparison against the year-ago period. In that quarter,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) signed a patent licensing agreement with     Ericsson that settled all litigation between the companies --     and temporarily added nearly $500 million to Ericsson's top     line.On top of the Apple effect, all three of Ericsson's     reportable segments delivered lower sales and smaller operating     profits on a year-over-year basis. However, network hardware     sales increase 33% sequentially and drove global service     revenues 15% higher, thanks to strong order volumes in several     key markets.Image source: Ericsson.Ericsson's management did not provide firm guidance targets   for the coming quarter or fiscal year. Instead, they said that   markets would stay ""tough"" in 2017, putting pressure on sales   expectations. Gross margins are expected to improve in the second   half of 2017, ending a negative streak that started in the spring   of 2016.What management had to sayIn aconference callwith Wall Street analysts, Ekholm provided a reminder of what   Ericsson is all about. Investors might see this note as a call to   arms, getting back to the nuts and bolts of running a   multinational technology business. Ekholm said:We are in a technology industry. We need to be technology     leaders and stay at the forefront of the technology     development. Ericsson has a unique set of assets with our     products but we also have services and solutions, and that     package creates a unique position for us to compete in the     market. That's something we need to leverage, but it's also     something we continuously need to invest in and develop.Looking aheadWith degrees in electrical engineering and economics and 10   years of service on Ericsson's board of directors, Ekholm seems   exceptionally qualified for his new job. Vestberg is moving   on to lead Sweden's Olympic committee, including efforts to host   the Winter Games in 2026.Ekholm is widely expected to restructure Ericsson around the   next generation of mobile technology, known as 5G, alongside   support for cloud computing and the Internet of Things. It's less   obvious where he will start slashing Ericsson's efforts and   expenses in order to achieve that sharper focus. Ekholm   reportedly started making the rounds among Ericsson's top   customers in North America, Asia, and Europe as soon as he was   selected, giving him a three-month head start.Starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, Ericsson   will report results in three new segments: networks, media, and   IT and cloud.10 stocks we like better than Telefonaktiebolaget LM     EricssonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cirrus Logic (CRUS) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?;1/30/2017;"Cirrus Logic Inc.CRUSis set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 1. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 30.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company posted better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  The year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were also favorable.Notably, as per revenue segments, Portable audio product revenues accounted for approximately 89% of the total revenue last quarter. Also, Cirrus Logic generates a significant portion of its revenues from Apple Inc.AAPL. This means that there is always a risk of losing an Apple design contract, which will significantly hurt the company's financials.We remain cautious about the company as the current global economic downturn might have an impact on its performance in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. and STMicroelectronics, which remains a headwind.Nonetheless, continued investments in the audio segment are expected to have a positive impact in the long run. Additionally, synergies from acquisitions and expansion in the LED market continue to drive growth.Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCirrus Logic, Inc.

3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week;1/29/2017;"Stocks rose by a full percentage point last week, buoyed by a   strong initial crop of earnings reports. With that gain, theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) and theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  indexes are both up by about 2% so far in   2017 after rising by double-digits last year.^DJIdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Earnings seasons ramps up over the week ahead as hundreds of   companies post results for the final quarter of 2016. A few of   the most anticipated reports will come fromUnder Armour(NYSE: UAA) (NYSE: UA) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Apple goes for growthApple shares are back at all-time highs heading into Tuesday's   report, which is expected to show that the consumer electronics   titanreturned to sales growthfollowing three consecutive quarters of declines.iPhone SE. Image source: Apple.Apple's iPhone business accounts for almost two-thirds of   sales, and so investors will be keen to know how the franchise   did over the critical holiday quarter. At its last quarterly   check-in, iPhone unit sales fell by 5% and average selling prices   declined as well. Those trends should improve to overall growth   this quarter due to healthy demand for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7   Plus.Other data points worth watching will be gross profit margin,   which CEO Tim Cook and his executive team forecast to decrease   slightly to 38% of sales. Meanwhile, management has highlighted   Apple's growing recurring revenue stream lately, including the   24% boost in its services segment last quarter. Yet the company's   outlook for the coming quarter is likely to grab the most   attention from investors, as it will imply either a return to   shrinking sales or accelerating growth ahead.Facebook's advertising volumeInvestorsweren't thrilledwith social media giant Facebook's last quarterly report. Its   operating results showed rock-solid growth, though, with revenue   spiking 56% due to an almost-60% jump in advertising sales. Its   massive base of daily active users also rose 17% to 1.18 billion   as average revenue per user crossed the $4 mark worldwide.Yet the stock declined as Wall Street fretted about an   upcoming slowdown. ""Expect to see ad revenue growth rates come   down meaningfully,"" executives warned in early November. That's   no surprise, given that advertising has jumped at a 50% pace over   the past few years.The company doesn't have much more room to increase the volume   of ads that it drops into users' timelines, though, and so   further gains will likely come from things like increased   engagement, which don't pack the same punch as scaled-up   delivery. That's why this week's focus will likely be on how   management sees its advertising trends changing as the segment   matures.Under Armour needs a winThere's a disconnect between Under Armour's business and its   stock price heading into Tuesday's report. Its awesome expansion   streak makes it one of the fastest-growing companies in the   S&P 500, and yet it was among the worst-performing stocks in   the index last year.The sports-apparel specialist could resolve that tension by   posting accelerating sales gains along with firmer profitability   this week. However, CEO Kevin Plank and his executive team aren't   predicting a rebound in either area.Image source: Getty Images.In fact, sales growth is likely to stay at just above 20% this   quarter and for the foreseeable future, marking a slowdown from   the 30% pace it enjoyed as recently as the first quarter of 2016.   A surprise slowdown in the U.S. market is offsetting gains   internationally to keep Under Armour's growth pace about even   with executives' goals.What's really unnerved investors is the fact that   profitability has declined to itslowest level on recordas the company drives deeper into athletic shoe sales and spends   aggressively to defend market share in the U.S. Those shifts   convinced management to lower their earnings outlook through 2018   while preserving their long-term bullishness on the industry.   This week's report might produce a large stock price swing if it   alters those broad expectations in either direction.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How Skyworks Solutions Inc Is Growing Beyond Apple;1/29/2017;"Image source: Skyworks Solutions.Skyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) investors couldn't have asked for a better start   to its fiscal 2017. A first quarterearnings beatand a stronger outlook for the ongoing quarter sent its stock   soaring to new 52-week highs, as it rose over 13% in a single   day.makeArticleAd();For the fiscal second quarter, Skyworks believes that its   revenue will grow 8% year-over-year to $840 million, exceeding   the consensus forecast of $818 million, while earnings of $1.40   per share should significantly outpace analyst estimates of $1.24   per share.Skyworks also delivered some solid long-term takeaways in its   latest quarter. The company is now boasting of design wins at   high-volume smartphone companies in China, as it is growing its   revenue outside ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Still, Apple reportedly contributed 40% of   Skyworks' top line in fiscal 2016.However, the company has been gradually working toward winning   more business from other clients, and it has found some   success.Growing beyond AppleSkyworks' business outside of Apple increased 8% in the last   fiscal year, as Vivek Arya of Merrill Lynch pointed out on the   latest conference call. Though this might not seem really big   right now, the fact that overall revenue fell 1.3% year-over-year   in the first quarter makes the growth beyond Apple a crucial   factor for long-term success.In fiscal 2015, Apple wasreportedly44% of Skyworks' business. Thus, it can be assumed that of   Skyworks' total revenue of $927 million in the first quarter of   2016, Apple contributed about $408 million of that. By   comparison, the smartphone giant should have contributed $366   million to Skyworks' revenue (40% of $914 million) in the most   recently reported quarter. This indicates that revenue from Apple   fell about 10% year-over-year.That indicates Skyworks' growth from other clients powered its   revenue and earnings beat last quarter. This is why Skyworks   needs to aggressively pursue client diversification if it wants   to mitigate the slowdown in business with Apple.Diversifying in the right areasSkyworks Solutions is building an army of clients in China.   One of the most prominent names is Huawei. The company has been   supplying its SkyBlue technology to the Chinese smartphone maker   for its flagship Mate 9 smartphone. In fact, according to   Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin, Huawei is now the company's second   biggest client.This is a big deal for Skyworks since Huawei is now a   formidable name in the smartphone industry. According to the   latest data available from IDC, Huawei's smartphone market share   stood at 9.3%, trailingSamsung's 21% share and Apple's 12.5% share in the third quarter of   2016. More importantly, the Chinese smartphone giant has been   selling more of its high and mid-range phones, which account for   57% of its total shipments.With a higher share of Huawei's sales being driven by premium   and mid-range devices, it has been able to increase the average   selling price of its phones. When the company had released its   2015 results, its average selling price of smartphones was up 17%   to $204 per unit. Though the company has not released 2016   numbers yet, Huawei is capable of increasing its selling prices   once again as it has been introducing its flagship phones in   global markets.The higher average selling price, along with higher volumes,   is good news for Skyworks since it will be able to enhance its   dollar content in Huawei devices, which are in turn enjoying   higher selling prices. Market research firm TrendForce   points out that smartphone production will increase 4.5% this   year to 1.4 billion units. Chinese smartphone companies will   account for 634 million units of this production, with Oppo,   Vivo, and Huawei being the biggest names. As Skyworks counts all   three of them as clients, it will witness a rise in chip sales   this year as the top Chinese smartphone companies are expected to   sell 39% more phones in 2017 as compared to 2016.Therefore, higher component demand by Chinese companies to   make more smartphones will push up Skyworks' average selling   prices, since it should be able to charge a premium in the wake   of tight supply. Skyworks can also make up for the volumes that   it is losing due to Apple's slowing iPhone sales, as it can now   sell more components to Chinese smartphone makers.Moving beyond mobileSkyworks' opportunities beyond mobile. Image Source:     Skyworks Solutions.The great thing about Skyworks is that it is pursuing   opportunities beyond mobile as well. The Internet of Things, or   IoT, is one such opportunity where the company is aggressively   enhancing its presence by launching new offerings.Skyworks released new front-end connectivity modules for   machine-to-machine connectivity and IoT operations a few weeks   ago. With its latest IoT product, Skyworks should be able to   accelerate the deployment of IoT applications by encouraging   migration from 2G networks due to its low cost and compact   packaging.This product development move by Skyworks is a smart one,   since the number of cellular devices communicating with each   other will rise from 300 million at present to around two billion   by 2020, according to GSMA. As the number of machine-to-machine   connections increases, Skyworks' connectivity modules that enable   the IoT will gain more traction and lead to higher shipment   volumes.However, the company does not single out its revenue or   shipments from the IoT segment, or any segment for that matter.   But the sheer growth in the size of this market, coupled with the   company's product development efforts, should prove to be a   tailwind in the long run.The Foolish takeawaySkyworks revenue is expected to increase 8.7% in the current   fiscal year, followed by stronger growth of 10.5% next year. It   appears to be pulling the right strings to diversify its revenue   away from heavily concentrated clients such as Apple, which seems   to have hit its ownroadblocks. As a result, Skyworks is well-positioned for long-term success   as it focuses on markets that have significant room for growth   versus areas approaching saturation.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Stock Has a Lot to Prove on Tuesday;1/29/2017;"Image source: The Motley Fool.One of the biggest earnings reports this week will beApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The world's most valuable consumer tech company   will be reporting its fiscal first quarter results after the   market close on Tuesday, and it wouldn't be a surprise if the   numbers move bothApple stockand the market in general.makeArticleAd();Apple stock hit a fresh 52-week high on Thursday, and with the   shares trading 36% off their springtime lows, it's easy to see   how proving mortal can trigger a sell-off. The silver lining here   is that just a sliver of its gains have come in the past three   months. Apple shares have risen a mere 3% since its last   quarterly report.Wall Street pros aren't holding out for much. They see $77.38   billion in revenue for the holiday quarter, just 2% more than   what Apple scored during the prior year's holiday quarter.   Analysts are also forecasting a profit of $3.22 a share, just   below the $3.28 Apple delivered a year earlier.Grate expectationsIf a 2% uptick in revenue and a 2% dip in earnings per share   seem uninspiring, keep in mind that three months ago we saw   revenue and earnings slide 9% and 15%, respectively, during   Apple's fiscal fourth quarter. A huge decline in China and a   modest slide in the Americas couldn't be overcome by smaller   gains in Europe and Japan. Apple's 24% surge in services revenue   was the lone bright spot, and no match for selling fewer iPhones,   iPads, and Macs.Bulls will argue that Tuesday's report will feature the first   full quarter of availability for the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch   Series 2 after their September debuts, but it was also when the   iPhone 6s came out a year earlier. The prior year was also the   first holiday season of Apple Watch availability.Unfortunately for Apple, Wall Street's gotten better at   forecasting its financial performances. Apple used to routinely   blast through analyst profit targets with ease when the iPad was   new and the iPhone was all the rage during the early years of the   mobile revolution. They're getting closer to the truth these   days. Apple hasn't topped Wall Street profit estimates by more   than 3% over the past year, and that's with the benefit of   aggressive share buybacks propping up profitability on a   per-share basis. Apple's outstanding share count has declined in   each of the past four years.Analysts who have chimed in with updates in the days leading   up to Tuesday's report have been mixed. Mark Moskowitz at   Barclays downgraded Apple from ""overweight"" to ""equal weight,""   concerned about the upside for all of 2017. He lowered his price   target from $119 to $117, below where the stock is at now.Credit Suisseanalyst Kulbinder Garcha checked in a day later with a more   upbeat take, but his ""outperform"" rating and $150 price goal is   based more on the potential of the hyped-up iPhone 8 that should   be released later this year than anything that we will see in   Tuesday's report.One can argue that the scene is set for Apple to shine.   Analysts are looking beyond the fiscal first quarter, and the   stock hasn't kept up with the market since its last quarterly   report. After three quarters of year-over-year revenue declines,   even a token increase could give investors a chance to exhale.   The continuing growth of services revenue could ultimately get   net margins moving in the right direction again. We won't have to   wait long to see what Mr. Market thinks.

Will Lawsuits Force Apple, Inc. To Prevent Texting And Driving?;1/29/2017;"Distracted driving is a big and growing problem. In 2014,   3,179 Americans were killed in traffic accidents involving   drivers diverting their attention to activities like eating,   talking on their phone, or texting. It's the third most deadly   factor in modern car accidents, behind only drunk driving and   speeding.You'll be delighted to hear that iPhone makerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has patented a way to reduce this menace. But the   patented solution is not yet implemented on any of Apple's   devices.What gives? Let's have a look.makeArticleAd();What's new?Last week, a survivor of a distracted-driving incident filed a   class action lawsuit against Apple. The suit is not seeking a big   payout from Cupertino. Instead, it calls for an injunction   against sales of Apple devices in California until the company   implements its patented prevention method against texting and   driving on devices both new and already sold.""If texting and driving is a vessel of trouble, Apple is the   captain of the ship,"" the court filing states. ""The company   enjoys 40 percent of the smartphone market share -- far more than   the nearest competitor. And its profits are enormous. Fortune   Magazine reports that in the third quarter of 2016, Apple   generated 91% of the smartphone market's profits, equating to a   cool $8.5 billion in net profit -- or about $95 million in profit   per day.""So the suit argues that Apple plays a significant part in the   distracted driving problem, and has both a responsibility and the   financial wherewithal to do something about it. Indeed, there is   a tool on the table. The filing cites an Applepatentfor disabling a mobile device when its motion sensors and other   systems detect patterns consistent with driving a car. Filed in   2008, when the ancientiPhone 3Gwas brand new, and approved by the Patent Office in 2014, Apple   has had an eye on this issue since the very beginning of its   smartphone exploits.But again, nearly three years after that patent got an   official approval, the technology remains unused.This lawsuit is not the first legal challenge to cite Apple's   anti-distraction patent. It's just the first one that primarily   wants to force Apple's hand into doing something with this   allegedly life-saving technology. Others have been more concerned   with cash payments for damage done by iPhone-wielding   drivers.Image source: US Patent and Trademark Office.Why isn't Apple using this patent yet?Many fully granted patents never see the light of day in a   real-world implementation. This particular one could be among   those for a variety of good reasons. For example:Apple could be working on a better solution than the one     described in the '143 patent, but the new and improved solution     isn't ready for a date with the Patent Office yet.The company might have found flaws in its original     technology, which was developed and filed at a time when     smartphones were a poorly understood novelty. Real-world     experience and deeper research could have changed Apple's     design requirements in a hurry.Other companies may have unveiled better solutions for the     dangers of distracted driving, perhaps as part of efforts to     come up with fully automated driving platforms. Nearly every     major auto maker is on board with theautonomous drivingtrend now, alongside plenty of technology experts. I'd be     surprised to learn that Apple's efforts from way back in 2008     provided a better solution than what all of Detroit and Silicon     Valley could whip up nearly a decade later.That's just scratching the surface of about a zillion reasons   not to take a patented technology to market. I'm sure that Apple   will come up with many more if the lawsuit ever hits a   courtroom.Image source: Apple.What's next?No, I don't think that Apple will ever actually implement this   particular deterrent to texting and driving. Lawsuits won't   change that. Halting iPhone sales in California would be a   powerful incentive, but Apple's top-shelf legal eagles can surely   head that threat off at the pass. However, the fact that   consumers are standing up to ask Apple for help with this   conundrum could accelerate Apple's arrival at a more complete   solution.The company must balance the benefits of a life-saving safety   feature against the risk that users might find the new   restrictions too overbearing. If your phone came with opt-in   restrictions on how you can use it in the driver's seat of a car,   would you enable them? If not, you'd be part of the problem.   Therefore, this is the kind of feature that needs to be forced on   the user with no obvious way to turn it off. Otherwise, the   change is not likely to make a difference.Apple obviously doesn't want to push any of its loyal users   over to Android and other platforms, where they can continue   their risky behavior unfettered. Ideally, the smartphone industry   would come together and push out protection against texting and   driving. No fuss, no muss, and thousands of lives potentially   saved. Top-down regulations would also do the trick, but that   solution would also elicit pained groans of heavy-handed rules   from every company in the mobile industry.There may not be a real solution to the distracted driving   problem until self-driving cars go mainstream. Until then,   lawsuits and concerned users can only hope to turn Apple's   smartphone designs in a safer direction.Don't hold your breath.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions Inc. vs. Infinera;1/28/2017;"Investing in the tech sector can be tricky. Competition     tends to be fierce, which makes it difficult to stay one step     ahead. Two companies that have a strong history of maintaining     their edge areSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS)  andInfinera(NASDAQ: INFN) . Both of these businesses have been taking     market share in their industries for years, which is     impressive. But which of these two tech companies is the better     investment today? Let's review the bull thesis for each company     so we can make an informed decision.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The case for Skyworks SolutionsSkyworks designs and builds chips that allow devices to   connect to each other. The company's semiconductors are found in   a wide range of products such as routers, tablets, cars, and   smartphones.While this industry is quite competitive, Skyworks' unique   ability to create custom and complex solutions for its customers   has given it a big edge over rivals. In fact, Skyworks chips can   currently be found in nearly all of the top-selling smartphones   in the world, including those made bySamsung, Xiaomi, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .The massive boom in smartphone sales over the last few   years has been a godsend for Skyworks. The company's revenue,   margins, and profits have all soared, which has taken long-term   investors on a lucrative ride.SWKSdata byYChartsWith the Internet of Things ramping up and 5G technology set   to deploy, Skyworks looks well positioned to continue delivering   for investors from here. However, Skyworks does have   an Achilles heel that investors should be aware of.   Apple is responsible for more than 40% of Skyworks' total   revenue, which is a blessing and a curse. When iPhone sales are   booming, Skyworks' results soar. However, when the Mac maker   decides to reduce its channel inventory, Skyworks reallyfeels the pain.While Skyworks has been signing deals in recent years to help   reduce its customer concentration, Apple is such a huge component   of Skyworks revenue that these two companies will remain attached   at the hip -- for better or worse -- for the foreseeable   future.The case for InfineraInfinera is a fast growing player in the   optical networking equipment market. The company's products   make internet providers lives easier by allowing them to easily   (and cheaply) move vast quantities of data around the globe.Like Skyworks, Infinera has also benefited from a number of   tech trends. The rise of cloud computing and streaming high-def   video is making it difficult for providers to keep up with   demand. That's forcing them to invest huge sums of money to   expand their networks, which has been a boon to Infinera's   business.Image source: Getty Images.That's a wonderful backdrop, but Infinera hasstruggledover the last few quarters to translate that bandwidth   demand growth into financial success. While there are several   factors to blame, one of the biggest problems is   competition.Ciena-- a much larger rival -- has caught up to Infinera's   technological edge and has been eating the company's lunch as of   late. While Infinera's management is aware of the problem and is   investing heavily to recapture its edge, it might be a long-haul   until the company returns to top-line growth.Of course, those worries have now beenpriced into the company's stock, so investors could be in a position to win big if the company   can grow faster than market watchers expect.The better buyWhile I'm hopeful that Infinera can right its ship, there are   never any guarantees of success. For that reason, I think that   the better choice for investors today is Skyworks. Not only does   Skyworks promise high growth rates ahead, but it is already so   profitable that it pays out a fast-growing dividend and still   has enough cash left over tobuy back boatloads of stock. As long as the company can continue to make progress at fixing   its customer concentration issues, then its future is looking   quite bright.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Chronological History of How Qualcomm Became the Most Powerful Apple Supplier Ever;1/28/2017;"Image source: Apple.If you read throughApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) blockbuster lawsuit againstQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , there's quite a bit of animosity toward how   Qualcomm conducted its business with Apple over the years. This   was not a pleasant relationship -- at least according to   Apple.makeArticleAd();Instead, this relationship was skewed significantly in favor   of Qualcomm, and there wasn't a whole lot that Apple could do   since the iPhone fundamentally relies on cellular connectivity.   This is easily the only time that Apple has not had the upper   hand with a supplier relationship. Look no further than Apple's   ownnegotiating tacticswith now-defunct GT Advanced to see how hard Apple could squeeze   its suppliers. Yet Qualcomm was able to become the most powerful   Apple supplier ever.This story has at least a decade of history that you need to   know to fully appreciate why Apple felt desperate enough to sue.   ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it,"" said   CEO Tim Cook in 2014, so we know Apple isn't trigger-happy when   it comes to suing. The Mac maker simply had enough. Note that   what follows is largely Apple's side, as laid out in the   complaint. Qualcomm will of course offer a different   perspective.That being said, let's start from the beginning.2007: Apple introduces the original iPhoneMuch of Qualcomm's patent portfolio is considered essential to   cellular standards that enable modern mobile devices to connect   to cellular networks, which is the foundation of its licensing   business. Standards-essential patents (SEPs) must be licensed to   anyone, including competitors, at fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates.Apple initially sourced baseband modems from Infineon, which   was subsequently acquired byIntel, for the first four years. Even before Apple ever bought its   first Qualcomm baseband, it had to pay licensing fees indirectly   through its contract manufacturers. Apple attempted to negotiate   a direct license with Qualcomm, but was unable to, according to   its complaint:Apple has been indirectly paying Qualcomm licensing fees     since 2007, when it released the iPhone....In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone using Intel (then     Infineon) baseband processor chipsets. Qualcomm required     licensing fees for using these chipsets. Rather than grant     Apple a direct license on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has instead     entered into confidential licenses with specific Apple contract     manufacturers (""CMs""), the third-party manufacturers who make     and assemble Apple products. The CMs pay the exorbitant     royalties Qualcomm demands and pass the costs along to Apple in     full.As a way to get relief on excessive royalties, Apple entered   into a ""Marketing Incentive Agreement"" with Qualcomm in 2007 that   prohibited it from marketing WiMAX devices, an emerging 4G   standard that would compete with LTE -- and which Qualcomm lacks   meaningful patents for. Obviously, if Apple can't market a   device, it won't make said device. While this was before Apple   became a major player in the smartphone market, this agreement   certainly contributed to WiMAX's death.It was around 2007 that Qualcomm allegedly stopped licensing   its SEPs to rivals, and began charging separately for licenses.   This violated thepatent exhaustion doctrineof patent law.Around 2007, Qualcomm's practice of licensing its     FRAND-encumbered cellular SEPs to competitors changed. In 2006,     Qualcomm's 10-K stated that it entered into ""License     Agreements"" with competing chipset manufacturers, and received     royalties thereunder. In Qualcomm's 2007 10-K, the term     ""License Agreements"" was replaced by ""Agreements."" Qualcomm's     2008 10-K provided that in ""every case, these agreements do not     allow such integrated circuit suppliers to pass through rights     under Qualcomm's patents to such suppliers' customers, and such     customers' sales of CDMA-based wireless subscriber device into     which such suppliers' integrated circuits are incorporated are     subject to the payment of royalties to us in accordance     with the customers' separate licensing arrangements with     us.""...Since at least 2007, Qualcomm has engaged in systematic,     continuous conduct to exclude competition in the relevant     chipset markets.2008: Turmoil in the baseband marketIn January,Analog Devicesexited the baseband market by selling its baseband business to   MediaTek for $350 million in cash. MediaTek was one of the few   remaining baseband companies.In October, Freescale announced that it was discontinuing   all mobile chips, including basebands, RF transceivers, and   more.2009: Joint ventures, negotiations, and regulatory   actionsEricssonandSTMicroelectronicsformed a joint venture, ST-Ericsson, in order to target the   mobile market, including basebands, among other chips.Knowing that it wanted to eventually release an iPhone that   could connect to CDMA networks, Apple started to lay the   foundation of procuring baseband chipsets from Qualcomm in the   near future. Incredibly, Apple was unable to get Qualcomm to   commit to its supply requirements, a standard ask of prospective   suppliers. On the contrary, Qualcomm specifically retained the   right to withhold chips as leverage.The 2009 Strategic Terms Agreement (""STA"") addresses the     process by which Qualcomm supplies chipsets and associated     software to Apple. It also restricts Apple's ability to sue     Qualcomm for patent infringement concerning Qualcomm chipsets.     While Apple generally negotiates firm supply commitments with     its component vendors, Qualcomm refused to provide Apple such a     commitment, instead arbitrarily capping its liability for     failure to supply, and reserving for itself the ability to     terminate its obligation to supply chipsets to Apple's CMs.     Qualcomm's unilateral right to terminate supply of chipsets to     Apple's CMs was retained in the Amended and Restated Strategic     Terms Agreement (""ASTA""), effective February 28, 2013.During this year, Qualcomm also found itself subject to   regulatory investigations in both Japan and South Korea over its   shenanigans.The Japan Fair Trade Commission (""JFTC"") has been     investigating Qualcomm since 2006. In September 2009, the JFTC     concluded that Qualcomm violated the Japanese Antimonopoly Act     by forcing licensees to cross-license their patents on a     royalty-free basis and agree to a non-assert provision, and     ordered the company to cease these practices....In July 2009, the KFTC levied the largest fine it had ever     imposed on a company -- $207 million -- on Qualcomm for abusing     its dominant share of the CDMA chipset market.Note that this 2009 Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine is   separate from another one that the KFTC just imposed a few weeks   ago.2011: Apple launches the iPhone on Verizon, and Qualcomm's   exclusivity beginsThis was a big one. In many ways, this was the year that Apple   fullygot into bed with Qualcomm, largely becauseVerizon's 3G network uses CDMA instead of GSM. As the largest U.S.   carrier, it was an important strategic move for Apple ahead of   the scheduled end ofAT&Texclusivity. Fully aware of this, Qualcomm flexed its licensing   muscles:Apple became even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due to     Apple's desire to release an iPhone that could connect to CDMA     networks, such as Verizon's....Since 2011, when Apple introduced the first CDMA version of     its products, Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium     for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other respects     identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality     enabled. Qualcomm prices its CDMA chipsets without regard to     competitive alternatives.Qualcomm's exclusivity in supplyingallbaseband chipsets began in 2011. Seeking relief from excessive   royalties, Qualcomm gave Apple rebates that were contingent upon,   among other things, exclusivity. We're talking about billions of   dollars:Specifically, since 2011, Qualcomm has conditioned billions     of dollars in rebates on exclusivity or de facto exclusivity     from Apple.This exclusivity ended just a few months ago, with Intel   coming on board as a second supplier. The timing of this lawsuit   is surely not a coincidence.NVIDIAannounced in May that it is acquiring Icera's baseband and RF   assets for $367 million, with the hopes of both addressing the   baseband market as well as integrating cellular connectivity into   its new Tegra line of mobile chips.2012: Bye, TIAfter deciding to exit the baseband market four years prior,Texas Instrumentscontinued its plannedexit of the mobile chip market. TI discontinued its OMAP applications processors, and kept   ratcheting down its baseband business. TI had still been   making baseband for a few prominent customers, but now planned to   wind them down completely by year's end.2013: Another agreement, another exit, and another regulatory   investigationApple kicked off 2013 with a new Business Cooperation and   Patent Agreement (BCPA) that took effect on the first day of the   year. This was simply an agreement intended in part to provide   royalty relief. This BCPA also had the provision that Apple could   not instigate or induce any regulatory investigations, although   Apple was allowed to cooperate if approached.In general, the BCPA, effective January 1, 2013, provided certain incentives to Apple in exchange for     specifically defined business     cooperation, and provided Qualcomm certain rights to Apple     s patents. The BCPA expired     on December 31, 2016, and is attached hereto as     Exhibit A....From 2013 through mid-2016, Apple received quarterly rebates     from Qualcomm, including the rebates required under the BCPA,     called BCP Payments.In other words, Apple didn't even wait a full month following   the BCPA's expiration to file suit.Ericsson and STMicroelectronics decided to dissolve the   ST-Ericsson joint venture, with Ericsson taking over baseband   modem products. It would exit soon.Broadcomagreed in September to acquire the 4G LTE assets from   Japan-based Renesas for $164 million.China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)   began its anti-monopoly investigation in November.2014: Even more regulatory investigationsBroadcom announced in June that it wouldformally exitthe baseband market, and would attempt to sell its baseband   assets. The company expected to save $700 million in annual   operating expenses as a result. CEO Scott McGregor would later   say that Broadcom was losing $2 millionper dayby trying to compete in the baseband market. Of the initial 2,500   estimated layoffs, McGregor said 500 employees were able to find   other positions at Broadcom, but 2,000 workers were let go.No wonder companies kept exiting the baseband modem market.     Image source: Intel Investor Meeting 2014.Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European   Commission opened their own investigations, commencing in   September and October, respectively.Apple attempted yet again to negotiate a direct license,   knowing that several agreements would expire in less than two   years. It was unsuccessful.Discussions dating back to at least     November 2014 between Apple and Qualcomm about a     direct license for certain patents were conducted with     the knowledge that certain of the agreements governing the     parties' commercial relationship, such as the TA and BCPA,     were set to expire at the end of 2016.Roughly a year and a half after ST-Ericsson's dissolution,   Ericsson also bailed on basebands, cutting 1,000 jobs in the   process.2015: Qualcomm makes peace with China, attempts to with   AppleIn February, Qualcomm settled with China's NDRC and negotiated   a rectification plan. The company paid the $975 million fine in   full and agreed to modify its business practices in the Middle   Kingdom. Qualcomm began charging royalty rates of 5% for 3G CDMA   and WCDMA devices, including multimode devices that use both 3G   and 4G. 4G devices that do not use CDMA fetch 3.5%. In both   cases, that percentage is levied on a royalty base of 65% of the   device's net selling price. Qualcomm offered these terms to   Apple, but Apple rejected them, not believing that the offer was   consistent with FRAND.Four years after acquiring Icera's baseband assets, NVIDIA   announced in May that it would wind down its Icera baseband   operations, conceding defeat to Qualcomm.Marvellannounced a ""significant restructuring"" of its mobile platform,   alsobailing on mobile chipslike basebands and applications processors. Annualized operating   expense savings were estimated at $170 million to $220 million;   Marvell laid off 17% of its employees.The European Commission sent Qualcomm two formal   Statements of Objection in December based on its preliminary   conclusions that ""the company may have illegally paid a major   customer for exclusively using its chipsets and sold chipsets   below cost with the aim of forcing a competitor out of the   market."" Well, now we know who that major customer is, although   Apple wasn't named at the time.2016: The end of exclusivityApple approached Qualcomm once again in February looking for a   direct license. During discussions, Qualcomm disagreed on which   patents may or may not be in fact essential, and the company   removed a public list of its patents from its website.On February 5, 2016, Apple reiterated its interest in     exploring a direct license to certain patents in Qualcomm's     patent portfolio....Apple rejected Qualcomm's attempt to shirk its burden to     prove the merits of its claims. Qualcomm thereafter removed     from its website its public list of U.S. patents disclosed to     [European Telecommunications Standards Institute] and precluded     archive searching of that list. Consistent with Qualcomm's     other hide-the-ball behavior, this action makes it harder for a     licensee to determine which patents Qualcomm has declared to be     essential to cellular standards.Qualcomm's exclusivity as Apple's baseband supplier ended in   the spring.The KFTC requested information from Apple, and Apple testified   to the KFTC in August. Less than a month later, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding the quarterly Q2 rebate payment   outlined by the BCPA that Apple had earned as of June 30 but   wasn't due to be paid until September. Qualcomm hasn't paid the   subsequent two quarterly payments, either. The $1 billion that   Apple is seeking comprises three quarterly payments.2017: Back to the futureThat more or less brings us up to speed with how Qualcomm   extracted exclusivity from Apple, which was a key factor in   pushing out rivals. Apple is by far the largest purchaser of   stand-alone modems, and missing out on that business was utterly   fatal for rivals' baseband ambitions. In Apple's words:This conduct has foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from     dealing with Apple, a key purchaser of chipsets, leading to the     marginalization and exit of many of those competitors, and to     the acquisition and maintenance by Qualcomm of monopoly power.     But-for Qualcomm's conduct as alleged herein, rival chipset     manufacturers would have become stronger competitors to     Qualcomm.No other Apple supplier in history has been able to wield such   power over the Cupertino company. The key differentiator was   Qualcomm's massive patent portfolio, combined with its   willingness to disregard industry norms as well as its own FRAND   licensing commitments. Perhaps more importantly for Apple going   forward, there will probably never be another supplier with this   much power ever again.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;1/28/2017;"There's a lot to get to this week in solar, so let's dive   right in.The fast and furious progress of solar energyIn 2011, then Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy   Steven Chu launched the SunShot initiative with a goal of cutting   the cost of installing a utility-scale solar system for $1 per   watt by 2020. At the time, I called the 74% reduction in the cost   of solar in a decade ""an audacious goal.""Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Less than six years later and three years ahead of schedule,   I'm here to say that I underestimated the solar industry.   Projects are being built for less than $1 per watt today, and   cost reductions continue to amaze even the most bullish   observers. Everything from solar panels to inverters to   permitting costs have come down in the last six years with the   SunShot program helping with the reductions. And $1 per-watt   solar will lead to a whole new surge in demand, which is very   bullish for solar companies around the world.Apple and NV Energy find common groundBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) subsidiary NV Energy has taken its   share of lumps from the renewable energy industry over the last   few years. Solar advocates helped drive a ballot measure in   November that will give customers more choice than buying energy   from the monopoly. And casino companies, which are its largest   customers, are starting tocut their ties to the utilityand buy energy elsewhere.NV Energy may be learning that it can't take such an   adversarial approach to renewable energy and customers' desires   to buy renewables after agreeing to help Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)   build a 200 MW solar power plant by early 2019. The utility will   buy energy from the solar plant and sell the energy to Apple for   a data center in Reno, continuing Apple's growth in solar   adoption.Corporate customers will likely be big drivers of renewable   energy in 2017, demanding clean energy to power their businesses   around the country. Maybe utilities are finally learning that   it's better to go along with the renewable-energy revolution than   fight it and lose their customers to someone else.Don't freak out about the ITC... yetThe solar industry is abuzz with speculation about the solar   investment tax credit (ITC), which helps fund every solar project   in the country today. The subsidy was extended at the end of 2015   and is currently set to startstepping down from 30% in 2019to a permanent 10% from commercial projects, and 0% for   residential projects, starting in 2022.It's no secret that most of the new Trump Administration is   less in favor of renewable energy than the past administration,   so there's concern the ITC could be in trouble. But comments from   Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin in support of wind   subsidies, and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson in   relation to climate change, have eased some of those   tensions.Keep in mind that the ITC stepdown is current law and would   require an act of Congress, including 60 votes in the Senate, to   be repealed. I think that's unlikely to happen, especially when   you consider the 200,000+ jobs in solar and extreme popularity of   the energy source. The ITC seems safe, despite the likelihood   that it's unpopular inside the White House. Unless something   changes, solar investors can breathe a sigh of relief.News and notesHere are the other notable items of the week that investors   shouldn't lose sight of.Eos Energy Storage andSiemens(NASDAQOTH: SIEGY)announced a partnershipto integrate, install, and service utility-scale energy-storage   solutions. It's hard to state how big it is that a giant in   electricity-distribution equipment is taking a role in energy   storage, which will help solar provide more value to the grid. We   don't know exactly what will happen with the partnership in terms   of costs or demand for utility-scale storage, but the fact that   it's on the radar of giants of the industry is big for renewable   energy.Pattern Energy Group(NASDAQ: PEGI) announced the closing of $350 million in senior   notes due 2024 with a 5.875% interest rate. The financing will   help the company pay down short-term debt and acquire more   renewable-energy projects. If this is a sign that yieldco   financing is opening up, it would be good for the entire   industry.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) signed a contract earlier this week with the   Sacramento Municipal Utility District to sell energy from a 60 MW   solar farm over the course of 20 years starting in mid-2017.   There haven't been a lot of big contract signings in the U.S.   over the past year, so any movement in the space is notable, even   if 60 MW is only about 1% of Canadian Solar's annual   manufacturing capacity.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft's Surface Lineup Is Now a $4.3 Billion Business;1/27/2017;"Surface lineup. Image source: Microsoft.WhenMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) first launched itsSurface lineup in 2012, I had my doubts as to whether or not the company could   successfully jump into hardware. The company has had its fair   share of missteps for the Surface, but it's safe to say at this   point that Microsoft has exceeded most early expectations for its   first-party devices. Microsoft has adapted quickly to flops like   Surface RT, which resulted in a $900 million writedown back in   2013, and pushed forward with expanding the portfolio, most   recently with Surface Studio.makeArticleAd();Surface revenue during the fourth quarter came in at $1.3   billion, representing a sequential increase of over 40% for the   busy holiday shopping season. That's enough to bring full-year   2016 Surface revenue to an impressive $4.3 billion.Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author. Calendar years     shown.It also probably helps that CEO Satya Nadella is a stronger   leader than his predecessor, even though the Surface strategy was   conceived under Steve Ballmer. The push with Surface hardware   created a rift between Ballmer and Bill Gates, and may have also   contributed to Ballmer's ouster.Out with the old, in with the newDuring the earnings call, Nadella noted that Surface has   enjoyed three consecutive quarters of 25%-plus growth. Sales mix   is transitioning toward the newer products like Surface Pro 4 and   Surface Book, and Surface 3 sales are expected to continue   winding down.The customer reception for Surface Studio in particular has   been strong, which is especially impressive for two reasons:   Surface Studio was not widely available during the fourth   quarter, and it's extremely expensive, starting at $3,000.   Inventories for the new all-in-one should start improving this   quarter as production ramps up.Taking a bite out of AppleMore broadly, Surface is but part of a bigger push among the   Windows PC crowd to take a bite out ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) turf: the premium PC market. Surface is doing   well, but it was never expected to comprise a large chunk of the   Windows ecosystem; that's what original equipment manufacturers   (OEMs) are for.CFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft's ""OEM non-pro performance   should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the premium   device category."" In other words, high-end consumer-oriented PCs   made by Microsoft's partners are gaining traction in the market,   at a time when Apple lost PC market share for thefirst three quartersof 2016 (Apple reports fourth-quarter results next week). OEM   non-pro revenue grew 5% last quarter, outpacing the broader PC   market.Surface is profitable, tooIt's also worth pointing out that Surface is now profitable on   a gross margin basis (up 6% last quarter in dollar terms), so   those revenue gains are starting to enjoy some operating   leverage.Unfortunately, currency headwinds are adversely impacting   profitability, as Surface gross margin was up 17% on a constant   currency basis in dollar terms. There's a big discrepancy between   the currency impacts on revenue (2 percentage points) compared to   gross margin (11 percentage points), which is due to the fact   that Surface devices are manufactured in Asia and the Surface   cost structure is more vulnerable to currency fluctuations.Still, you have to give Nadella credit for being able to take   a struggling segment conceived under Ballmer and turn it into a   profitable $4.3 billion business within just a couple of   years.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmidst the bombast, braggadocio and fact-free claims of the 2016 presidential campaign, perhaps the most effective was the subtext contained in President Trump's incessantly cited mantra, ""Make America Great Again.""makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe implication of this successful sonnet of sloganism is that America is not great, at least not in its current iteration. And while certainly an effectual rhetorical rallying point for the most disaffected voters, the claim fails to hold up to scrutiny when one takes a more lucid view of the corporate and investing landscape.Indeed, there are scores of companies, and scores of stocks to own, that already make America great. These are the companies that make the products and services that Americans organize their lives around. Creators of communication devices, social media networks and information retrieval services are just a few of the brilliant achievements of entrepreneurial Americans that have made the country great through the genius of their ideas.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018They're also among the top companies, and the top stocks, that make our nation great for investors.

The company's iconic ""7 Series"" passenger jets - the 747, 737, 777 and 787 - have allowed not just Americans, but travelers worldwide to speed off to their destinations safely, and in style. If you want evidence of American corporate greatness, just look to the sky near any major metropolitan airport. You're sure to spot the greatness of Boeing in flight.Stocks to Buy:Amazon.com (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockOnline seller of everythingAmazon.com(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been making America great for nearly 23 years. The brainchild of CEO Jeff Bezos began life as a hub where avid readers could get the latest novels, and discover both new and old works that would appeal to their tastes.That formula worked not only for literature, but for everything from music, film, video games, electronics, clothing, toys, toothpaste … and just about anything else one can require or desire.Amazon.com's relatively recent foray into the cloud computing business has been an unequivocal success, with the company raking in some $3.2 billion in cloud computing revenue in the third quarter of 2016.3 Fast-Food Stocks That Are Sweating Bullets Thanks to McDonald'sThat figure was up 55% from the same quarter the year prior. Amazon's web services business proves that not only does the company make America great by delivering the products we want right to our door, it also makes possible many of the e-commerce sites the American - and global - economy relies on to function smoothly.Stocks to Buy:Apple (AAPL)Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrPersonal technology giantApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is not only one of the most profitable companies in history, it's alsothe most admired.

Yet Facebook also was cited by President Trump as a key to his victory, as he told CBS'60 Minutesthat thepower of his following on the social media gianthelped him win key races where he was outspent by his opponent.The 3 Best Sector ETFs to Buy for a Profitable 2017So, Facebook not only already makes America great, it also made President Trump's campaign a winner.Stocks to Buy:Goldman Sachs (GS)Source:Erik DrostIf you were asked to compile a list of the ""Big Banks"" that have financed America's growth, as well as her ascension to greatness, it's hard not to start withGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS).The premier investment bank has been at the center of the financial world since the reparative, post-Civil War years, when it helped finance America's rebirth beginning in 1869.Since then the company has had a storied history of providing the capital, as well as the financial framework, that's nurtured the rise of the greatest capitalist experiment in history.In another example ofTrumpianirony, the president criticized the banks - and specifically Goldman Sachs - for transgressions that caused the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. Yet who did Trump turn to for key positions in his campaign and in his cabinet? You guessed it,numerous Goldman Sachs alumni.The moral of the story here is that when you want your own administration to be great, you turn to those who have done great things at one of the greatest American financial institutions.Stocks to Buy:Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockPerhaps the only thing not great aboutAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), better known as Google, is its ghastly choice of new moniker. Yet despite its ill-fitting name, Alphabet's core product - the Google search engine - has already made information-seeking America great.Founded by then-Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were at Stanford University, the tech entrepreneurs leveraged the PC and internet explosion and created the go-to source for information on just about anything imaginable.Its corporate mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, has long been accomplished. And though Google has only been in existence for less than 20 years, like Facebook, it also has become an essential part of the American and the international experience.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsJust try to go more than a few days without using Google. It's nearly impossible, especially if you are someone who loves knowing things.Stocks to Buy:Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockAnyone who has grown up in America since the 1940s, or who has reared children or grandchildren over the past five decades, knows all-too-well the draw that is theWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS).Purveyors of iconic American characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White and so many others, the company has built a media and entertainment empire by knowing what Americans (and the world) want to see.Disney's relatively recent acquisition of the Star Wars franchise is proof of the company's commitment to remaining the leader in providing entertainment with the broadest appeal.Founded on the genius of Walt Disney the man, the Disney Company was set up to be a dream factory capable of igniting children's imaginations all over the world. It's safe to say that it has done just that, and that it will remain great long after President Trump has completed his tenure in the Oval Office.Stocks to Buy:American Express (AXP)Source:Marcus Quigmire Via FlickrWhen ""American"" is part of your name, it's easy to make the short hop of logic needed to proclaimAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) a company that's already making America great. Indeed, the credit card issuer, andDow Jonescomponent, offers what is arguably the best customer service in the financial services industry.Moreover, it's an aspirational brand that pulls at the capitalist heart strings of nearly every American set on achieving financial prowess. For those who've experienced it, how can you forget being approved for your first American Express card? That grant signifies an arrival of sorts into an honored clubhouse of the financially fit.Here, too, irony and the Trump administration once again collide. If President Trump and the Republican Congress can get personal tax reform passed, American Express shares may be the biggest beneficiary. The reason why is because higher income and higher net worth consumers tend to use American Express more than rival credit cards.3 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy for Income and GrowthAs such, a reduction in marginal tax rates for the nation's top earners would likely translate into increased spending via AmEx - which would funnel down directly to AXP shares.Stocks to Buy:Caterpillar (CAT)Source:Anthony via FlickrThe makers of earth-shaping equipment have literally transformed the American landscape into man's image, a feat that on its own qualifiesCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) for a spot on the 10 stocks that already make America great.The unmistakable CAT brand is responsible for helping more builders erect more homes, shopping centers, office buildings, roads, bridges and dams than any government infrastructure project could ever do.In fact, any effort to make America's infrastructure great again would likely start with a whole lot of equipment from Caterpillar, as its heavy machinery is an integral part of massive build outs here at home, and worldwide.The CAT brand also is seen as a sort of badge of honor in the developing world, as developing nations seek to build their infrastructure in the image of the American landscape. To the rest of the world, America is already great … and they often use Caterpillar equipment to help their own nations look like us.Stocks to Buy:Tesla Motors (TSLA)Source: ShutterstockAmerica is a car culture country, and many of her most iconic brands -General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) - represent the best of American industrial prowess.While these storied brands could themselves be on any list of stocks that already make America great, one new car company embodies all of the entrepreneurial and innovative genius that's at the heart of what makes America special. That company isTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).The brainchild of the ceaselessly creative Elon Musk, Tesla has proven that luxury, performance and the lack of an internal combustion engine can be a splendid marriage; one never lacking in operator excitement. In fact, the experience of driving the posh, powerful and eminently smooth Model S through traffic is akin to what it must be like piloting a modern fighter jet through a formation of P-51 Mustangs.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryAnd while the World War II fighter helped make America great by vanquishing her enemies in aerial combat, Tesla's Model S, Model X and Model 3 are clearing a new path for automotive technology - technology that could be the American and global standard in decades to come.As of this writing, Jim Woods was long AMZN, FB, GS and TSLA stock.The post10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Greatappeared first onInvestorPlace."
The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This Quarter;1/27/2017;"Analysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. MicrosoftMSFTfor one has strongly resisted government demands as have AppleAAPLand AmazonAMZN. Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like IntelINTC, NVIDIANVDA, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro DevicesAMD; networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Has Quite a Wall to Climb;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenever high-flying stocks get their wings clipped, they are never the same on the markets.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) ended its recovery of the summer of 2016 when it warned on Nov. 2, 2016, that fourth-quarter estimates would miss estimates. Bears are all over the stock: short float stands at 43.5%. And when the company reports results in February, bulls still hope the company's wearables devices sold like hot cakes.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitExpectations Lowered for FIT StockIn its third-quarter report, the company cut the current quarter's estimatessharply:""The company expects revenue between $725 million and $750 million, representing growth of 2%-5%, with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.14 to $0.18, and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 33%.""At a full-year earnings per share of between 55 cents and 59 cents, FIT trades at a forward P/E of up to 13.5 times (Based on Thursday's closing price of $7.41). Investors clearly have low expectations for the company. Trailing quarterly sales grew by 23.1%. Shorts are winning the bearish bet because they understand a company with good products is not necessarily a good stock.Competition Heating UpDespite a record low valuation, low expectations for the quarter and potential growth in Europe and Asia, FIT stock has one big problem: competition. During the holiday season, consumers had the choice of buying many cheaper alternatives at a fraction of a FIT device. In Asia,Xiaomisells similar wearables for a fraction of FIT's price.On the high end, FIT competes with theGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) Vivosmart HR, which costs the same as Fitbit's Charge 2 (both cost around $149.95) andApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch 1 and 2.If FIT's stock collapses post-earnings, it will be among a long list of fallen fad stocks. This includesGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), whose action camera is losing popularity andEtsy Inc(NASDAQ:ETSY), whose handmade products compete withAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) homemadestore.Fitbit's next phase of growth depends on expanding internationally. Executing on this requires good management. When management said it mishandled the Flex 2 supply chain, few investors should have any confidence on management.On Jan. 12, news broke out that Fitbit may havewantedto acquireJawbonelate last year. This is another example that suggests investors should worry about FIT's management capability.Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) in the Fresh Food WarsThe company needs to preserve its cash, instead of spending it on supply chain managementBottom Line on FitbitFitbit knows that competition will worsen over time. Its (rumored) attempts to buy Jawbone would have eliminated that threat, positioning the company as a stronger foe against Apple, Garmin and the cheap wearable device makers.The stock is still a ""show me"" investment though, especially if holiday sales are underwhelming.As of this writing, Chris Lau had no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Today, we'll look at that and otherApple Rumorsfor Friday.makeArticleAd();iPhone 8 Concept:Designer Iskander Utebayev has created an interesting concept of what Apple's next iPhone may look like, reportsBGR. The designer created a sleek looking concept for the iPhone 8 that has a curved display. It's a slim device that has a sleek look to it. One interesting idea that can be seen in the concept is the change for the camera. The concept puts the camera for the iPhone 8 inside of the AAPL logo. It's an interesting idea, but not likely one the tech company will adopt.iPad Anniversary:Today is the 7-year anniversary for the iPad,MacRumorsnotes. Apple founder Steve Jobs introduced the iPad to audiences at a media event in 2010. He called it AAPL's ""most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price."" The original iPad had a 9.7-inch display with a resolution of 1024 x 768. It came in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models. The tablet was powered by the tech company's A4 processor.Apple Watch Music:Owners of the Apple Watch have the ability to take music with them on the go without their iPhone, reports9to5Mac. The smartwatch has the ability to store up to 2GB of music. It all has to be in a single playlist first. It also requires an iPhone to get the music on there in the first place. The smartwatch can also be paired with wireless headphones so users can listen to the music through them. All and all, its a bit of a complicated process, but it might be worth it for those that don't want to take their iPhone with them during their morning run.Check out more recentApple RumorsorSubscribe to Apple Rumors:RSSThe postFriday Apple Rumors: Designer Creates Interesting iPhone 8 Conceptappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the official Galaxy Note 7 battery review out of the way, everyone has been waiting forSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to release the new Galaxy S8. Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. NowVentureBeatsays it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungSamsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.First, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. Thatevent took place last week.Galaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery ConcernsAs part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.As a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The Guardian, citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to alate March release date. Yesterday,VentureBeat'sEvan Blassclaimed to have specifics, saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.Galaxy S8 DetailsTheVentureBeatreport also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.As has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved ""Edge"" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlikeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.By connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, theadvanced AI personal assistantSamsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)Interestingly,VentureBeatsays the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be €100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.The Importance of the Galaxy S8 LaunchIt can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.Both rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.In the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare haddropped 13.5%compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPatent wars are harmful to corporations and other growing things.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigital via FlickrApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has now gone to patent war withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), knocking 13% off the modem chip maker's market cap in less than a week.The warhas now extended to China, where two Apple suits are seeking $145 million in damages (about 1 billion Yuan) over how Qualcomm licenses patents there.This being early in the war, the response of Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf is""bring it on.""But, he hasn't seen the legal bills, yet. Shareholders, however, seem to have a clue about what they might be, and apparently feel they will be huge.Apple has yet to be hurt by any of this. AAPL stock price is up about 1.7% since the court papers were filed. But, the march to its record high of $132.54 per share, achieved in May 2015, may now be disrupted.3 Grossly Overpriced Tech Stocks That Could CollapseWhat the War Is AboutQualcomm controls standards essential patents (SEPs), including those for the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system used by carriers such asVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ). This means that every CDMA phone chip maker, and CDMA base station maker, is paying license fees to Qualcomm for using those patents. Apple began doing so in 2011when it opened the iPhone to Verizon's network.Qualcomm used its CDMA patents to become the sole supplier of modem chips for the iPhone. It liked this position and refused to join industry-wide agreements covering Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) access to its patents, giving QCOM the power to constrict Apple's supply of modem chips.Apple eventually foundanother supplier for the chips,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), while still paying license fees to Qualcomm.Qualcomm, meanwhile,won an expensive fight with China over its patent rights, and is fighting with South Korea after gettingSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to back down and use Qualcomm gear in its phones.The short version is that Qualcomm uses its patents to control the global phone market and Apple doesn't like that.The Risk to AppleWhile the market has discounted the risks in these fights to Qualcomm, it has not considered the potential impact on Apple. Credit the $642 billion market cap of Apple, against Qualcomm's $76 billion.There is also a whisper number on Apple earnings, due out January 31, of$77.04 billion in revenue and profit of $3.23 per share. Combine that with over $200 billion in cash and the market may be anticipating a raise in the Apple dividend, currently 57 cents per share. AAPL stock price is still floating on Christmas.But, the risks in a patent war are real. Intel had to turn itself inside-out to make those iPhone modem chips. Another generation of phones and networks is coming, and Qualcomm will have patents to fight with there, too.Apple has already suffered, the company claimed in court, losing a $1 billion rebate it says Qualcomm owed it after AAPL helpeda South Korean investigationinto Qualcomm's business practices, one that resulted in South Korea imposing$864 million in fines.So far, Qualcomm has won in China and it has won against Samsung, and Apple's legal arguments don't scare it. If Korea can get Qualcomm to pay the fine, Samsung may feel emboldened, but SSNLF isin disarrayand may not be in a position to fight Qualcomm any time soon. Apple has taken up its sword.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steals AI Expert Back From Apple Inc. (AAPL)Given Apple's market size, the cost of lawyers to fight Qualcomm business practices may appear to be a rounding error, but this is going to be a nasty and costly fight. Apple's autonomy in its supply decisions is at stake, as is Qualcomm's control over the market.The market has yet to discount Apple stock over the costs of this war, but I suspect that will happen soon.

Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants In;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's an awkward topic for rogue, extreme-right wing elements in our country. Heck,I'mnot even sure how I really feel about it. But there's a point where it's no longer useful to continuously ignore the giant pink elephant in the room. So here goes it - Asia will take over the world. There's not a darn thing anyone can do to stop the train. AndFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) will have it no other way.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn fact, Facebook is probably one of the few companies that recognize this demographic reality. Subsequently, FB stock is a very real challenger to the near-hegemonic dominance ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).Honestly, the social media network is well on its way to becoming whatApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) once was before copycat competitors entered the fray: a completely unique experience and solution with no natural predators.Interestingly, much of society is turning their back towards the demographic goldmine that Facebook stock is sitting on. The NFL celebrates ""Hispanic Heritage Month,"" and Mexico Cityhosteda regular-season game last year. After activists blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, the film industry made dramatic changes. According to NBC News, the ""'African-American Film Critics Association declared 2016 the best year forblacks in cinema'ever'.""While these are profound steps towards diversity and inclusion, there's a glaring omission. According to researchers at theUniversity of Southern California, ""'at least half or more of all cinematic, television, or streaming stories"" didn't portray a single Asian or Asian-American on screen.'""This ""yellow-out"" may be swept under the rug now, but mark my words, FB stock will change everything.Asian Markets Too Bigly for FB Stock to IgnoreAs InvestorPlace contributor Craig Adeyanju notes, the Facebook stock price is all about the numbers, and the numbers look amazing! Adeyanju writes that with ""Facebook on course to reach 2 billion users this year without China, the opportunities become bigger once China allows FB in its country again. Keep in mind that China currently has thelargest numberof internet users globally.""7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018He is so right - the number of China'sinternet usersexceed that of the U.S. by a more than 150% margin. Those are bigly consumers that FB stock desperately wants to tap into. But they're notthatdesperate. China is often overused as a justification for buying Facebook stock or any number of investments. However, just scale up the picture a bit and you'll see why Mark Zuckerberg is so excited.Themajorityof Earth's human population is Asian, period. Even if you were to open a ""heritage month"" for every race, color and creed in America, you would at most affect less than 5% of the world. Adding in the entire Latin American population would help, but the leverage would be less than Africa, and slightly more than Europe.An investment in Facebook stock is simply a recognition of a changing world. Unfortunately, few have this ability. For example,Princeton Universitydetailed evidence ofdiscrimination in academiadesigned to ""cull"" Asian student populations. In contrast, from the perspective of FB stock, these demographic trends are to be embraced, celebrated and ultimately, profited.Untapped Riches Still Available for Facebook StockI mentioned before that China is an overused argument. But when you drill deeper into the statistics, there's still a lot of gold for FB stock to mine. The perennial Asian powerhouse's internet penetration is just slightly above half the population. In contrast, the U.S. internet penetration is nearly 89%. That's the raw, low-hanging fruit from which Facebook stock can benefit.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep Delivering in 2017But even in a place like Japan, where the internet penetration is more than 91%, there's still a viable opportunity for FB. As of the midway point of last year, there were26 million JapaneseFacebook subscribers. That's less than a 21% penetration rate for the company. Japan is actually an unheralded market: it has an incredibly educated, tech savvy population.In many ways, that's a better prospect for FB stock rather than activating developing or frontier markets because of the existing infrastructure.Click to EnlargeBut the really exciting potential is that when developing countries reach the next stage, FB can spark a global revolution. Asia's total Facebook penetration rate is less than 14% - just marginally better than Africa. That means that the company's future is in Asian hands.The North American market is near realistic capacity at 62%, while Latin America is not that far behind at 52%. Given the enormous economic growth in Asia, that's not a bad gig for FB stock.While the rest of the world is focused on the transition of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Facebook has been looking at a trend decades in the making. Indeed, the movement is inevitable and will have far-reaching consequences well outside our lifetimes. They only thing any company can do is to prepare for it, and FB has a substantial lead.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017The postAsia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants Inappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Videogame Stock Roundup: Microsoft Reports Q2 Earnings, Nintendo Launches Pokemon Go in South Korea;1/27/2017;"Among the top stories this week, Microsoft Corp.MSFTreported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In a separate development, after almost a six-month delay, South Korean gamers can now enjoy Pokémon Go as NintendoNTDOYlaunched the game officially in the country.Meanwhile, Facebook IncFBzeroed in on Hugo Barra, an ex-Xiaomi executive to spearhead its VR initiatives.Recap of the Developments1. Microsoft's second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 83 cents and revenues $26.07 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though gaming is a very small part of the company's business, Xbox is an important aspect of the overall video game industry. Microsoft's gaming revenues fell 3% (1% in constant currency). Xbox Live monthly active users were up 17% to 55 million. The company witnessed more than 26 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets.The company's shares have surged 26% compared with the ZacksComputer-Softwareindustry's gain of 24.31% in the last one year.At present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.2. After a six-month delay, Nintendo has now officiallylaunchedits blockbuster hit game, Pokémon Go in South Korea, on both Alphabet'sGOOGLPlay Store and Apple Inc.'sAAPLiOS store. Per media reports, Nintendo's Pokémon Go works with Google Maps, which has ""limited access"" in South Korea. Niantic had earlier sought permission from the South Korean government for access to Korean maps, which was flatly refused. Google had not agreed to South Korean government's demand to ""blur"" sensitive locations like government buildings on Maps.Reportedly, the denial stemmed from the fact that South Korea remains concerned about its national security. It doesn't share warm ties with its neighbor, North Korea. The simmering border tension between the two nations has led the South Korean government to disallow storage of detailed maps of the country on any other servers except those in South Korea, add media reports.It remains unknown how Niantic, the firm which developed Pokémon Go, bypassed the Maps issue, add media reports. Niantic chose to remain silent on this issue during the press conference it held in Seoul on Jan 23, 2017.Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The success of Pokémon Go helped the company's share price. Over the past one year, its shares are up 55.86% compared with ZacksToys/Games/ Hobby/Productsindustry's gain of 18.42%.3. Meanwhile, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg in a post announced that ex-Xiaomi vice president, Hugo Barra will spearhead all the company's VR initiatives as well as the Oculus unit. Zuckerberg further added ""Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team.""Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel its ambitious AR/VR efforts. Zuckerberg has time and again mentioned that VR is the next big business opportunity. Facebook has been pumping ample resources to boost its VR efforts. A few days back, Zuckerberg said that Facebook was going to spend over $3 billion over the next 10 years.However, Oculus has beenslappedwith a $2 billion lawsuit filed by video game company, ZeniMax. Zuckerberg appeared in a Dallas courtroom to testify against the allegations. Apparently, Zuckerberg has denied all allegations and stressed that ""The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone else's is just wrong.""At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #2.  In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 39.92%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 19.39%.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:CompanyLast 5 DaysLast 6 MonthsATVI1.34%-5.03%EA1.68%6.32%GLUU6.98%-3.77%MSFT2.50%13.23%NTES6.00%23.20%TTWO4.15%33.77%ZNGA-2.65%-10.76%Over the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile IncGLUUwas up 6.98% whereas Zynga IncZNGAwas down 2.65%.Over the last six-month period, Take Two InteractiveTTWOsurged the most (33.77%).

How Intel Corporation Can Strengthen Its Relationship With Apple Inc.;1/27/2017;"With theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant   portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets   -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has   ever enjoyed.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found   inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that   don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rivalQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA   networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA.Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets   from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to   allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety   of Apple's cellular modem needs.Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to   what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against   Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that ""Qualcomm has charged   Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are   in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without   CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly   power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and   chipset supply terms,"" the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read.I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and   today there is an observation I would like to share regarding   Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones.Apple's component costs could come down if Intel     succeeds in implementing CDMABased on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges   Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled   compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual   practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel   routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain   features enabled, compared with variants without those features   enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work.Image source: Qualcomm.What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because   Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its   CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a ""monopolistic premium.""The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that   Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the   opportunity for Intel.If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also   supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA   networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open   the door to a couple of possibilities:Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It     could be a true ""second source"" for all the iPhones that Apple     ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to     Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment).Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from     Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of     total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel     and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could     help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular     modem.Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider   would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems.   This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and,   ultimately, net profit.To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says   that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that   Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20   for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7,   Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips;   the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel.If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence   of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across   potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year.   That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no   clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes   that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are   significant.Intel needs to executeThe key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building   increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then   that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell   more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper   modems.The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume --   whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the   very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale   of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate.In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip   business probably isn't going to sting Qualcommthatmuch. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this   cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on theright track.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Should You Sell Qualcomm After Apple's $1 Billion Lawsuit?;1/26/2017;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was   sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The lawsuit is related to the FTC's   separatelawsuit against Qualcomm, which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of   critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out   of the market. Let's take a closer look at this tangled   mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their   shares.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Why is Apple suing Qualcomm?Back in 2008,Sprintdeployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn't   heavily dependent on Qualcomm's patent portfolio.Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but   Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard --   which it could generate more licensing fees from.At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax   networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions,   Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple ""rebates"" for sticking with its   baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those   rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things --exclusivelyusing Qualcomm's chips (from 2011 to 2016), and notinstigatingany litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair   licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially   ""bribed"" Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to   competing chipsets.Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust   probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair   licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975   million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could   face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and   Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with   authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments -- which   it's now suing to recover.The outcome is anyone's guess...The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty   one, since it's dependent on many shifting variables. First, the   FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K.   Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that   was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump   Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is   dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement;   but if it isn't, the rebates could be invalidated as ""bribes"" --   which may hurt both companies.Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple   needs to prove that it didn't violate the two main conditions of   its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean   FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn't deny aiding the KFTC   at all -- it recently told CNN that it was merely   ""responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies"" instead of   ""instigating"" litigation against Qualcomm.Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing   practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device's   entire value, instead of just the chips in the device -- a   practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also   charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don't use any of   its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless   technologies -- although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm's   licensed patents don't actually cover those core technologies.   This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using   Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past),   and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of   rebates.Understanding the risks to QualcommIf Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other   regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing   model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business'   margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business   generates the lion's share of its profits.It could also jeopardize Qualcomm'splanned acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automotive   chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If   Qualcomm doesn't close that deal this year, its top line will   remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone   market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing   business.But should you sell Qualcomm?Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that   the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock   down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times   earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays   a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout   ratio of 53%.As a Qualcomm shareholder, I'm certainly disappointed with   recent developments. But I don't plan to sell my shares unless   the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to   dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I'll still   consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with   solid growth prospects inadjacent marketslike connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm's Earnings Call Dominated By Apple Lawsuit;1/26/2017;"CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Image source: Qualcomm.Mobile chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) reported fiscal first-quarter results last night.   While the results as well as guidance mostly topped analyst   expectations,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) recent lawsuit against the company expectedly   dominated the subsequent earnings call (""Apple"" was mentioned 74   times). For good reason, too, since Apple is widely considered   Qualcomm's largest customer, combined with the fact that the   lawsuit threatens Qualcomm's licensing model.makeArticleAd();Beyond a few brief statements, this is the first time that   Qualcomm has commented publicly and in granular detail regarding   the suit. Here's what management had to say.Prepared remarksCEO Steve Mollenkopf first noted that the two companies have   historically had a strong relationship, and Qualcomm intends to   ""remain a good supplier"" despite the legal complaint. The company   would naturally have preferred to settle its dispute with Apple   in private negotiations instead of litigation, but it remains   confident that it can defend itself in court. Mollenkopf summed   it up: ""Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in   the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of   intellectual property. They want to pay less for the fair value   that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our   technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits   from using that technology.""President Derek Aberle continued:Touching briefly on Apple's complaints filed in San Diego     and China, it claims that Qualcomm should be required to     license its cellular standard essential patents, or SEPs, to     modem suppliers. That even when licensing those patents at the     device level, Qualcomm should only be able to charge royalties     on the price of the cellular modem chip inside the device.These positions, however, are inconsistent with     long-standing industry practice, the [intellectual property     rights] policies of the relevant standard-setting bodies, the     realities of licensing large portfolios of patents, and basic     notions of efficiency, fairness in economics.Aberle points out that device-level licensing is utilized   throughout the industry by many major patent holders beyond   Qualcomm. (Apple is seeking chip-level licensing.) Qualcomm says   its patents also contribute to many other features in modern   smartphones beyond cellular connectivity, further justifying   device-level royalties. Shifting to chip-level royalties would   then introduce different layers of licensing for all the various   chips that Qualcomm enables or sells itself, so it licenses the   entire portfolio for the sake of efficiency.Apple says that there is no limit to the royalty rates, which   is why it seeks per-unit royalty relief in the form of ""rebate""   payments. Aberle says this is untrue:In addition, it is well known that Qualcomm has per-unit     running royalty caps as part of its licensing program. This     effectively results in licensees not paying running royalties     as a percentage of the device price above a certain net selling     price of any given device. Apple's claim that royalties are     uncapped is simply incorrect.Aberle also reiterated that Qualcomm believes Apple is   instigating these regulatory attacks as well as providing   inaccurate information:Apple claims that Qualcomm retaliated because Apple     cooperated with government investigations. To be clear, we did     no such thing. We simply objected to Apple making false and     misleading statements and withholding information to motivate     attacks against Qualcomm. We welcome the opportunity to have     Apple's claims heard in court, where we will be entitled to     full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of     the merits. We will prove that Apple's irresponsible claims of     extortion are false.There should be no immediate impact to sales from the lawsuit,   either. Apple still needs modems, and Qualcomm will still supply   them. CFO George Davis said, ""We are not forecasting any impact   to revenues related to the dispute with Apple, as we are   continuing to meet their supply needs in good faith and expect   Apple will continue to meet its obligations.""Questions and answersAs usual, the analyst Q&A often provides more color.   Qualcomm affirmed that Apple does not have a direct license, but   rather an indirect license through its contract manufacturers.   Qualcomm isn't worried about collecting, said Aberle:Apple does not have a direct license with Qualcomm today.     And so the royalties on Apple products that get paid to     Qualcomm are reported and paid by their contract manufacturers.     So although we do have a dispute now with Apple and they are     challenging some of the offers and some of our licensing terms,     the contracts that we have in place with their suppliers remain     valid and enforceable. And we would expect that our licensees     will continue to comply with the terms of their agreements. And     we would also hope and expect that Apple would not interfere     with the terms of those agreements. But of course, we can't     fully control those actions.When asked about the exclusivity and monopoly power   allegations, general counsel Don Rosenberg (who incidentally used   to work for Apple a decade ago), downplayed the idea that   Qualcomm wields monopoly power:With regard to your question about so-called exclusivity     deal, first of all, we -- I think you called this monopoly     power or had monopoly power. We don't believe we have monopoly     power in the chip market or any other market. And nor do we     have an exclusivity arrangement. We have never prevented Apple     or anybody else from buying from competitive chipmakers. And in     the Apple case, it's pretty clear since, as you know, they have     been buying fromIntelfairly recently. So it's a mischaracterization to call it an     exclusive dealing arrangement.This is a little murky, since Applehadbeen exclusively buying basebands from Qualcomm for five years,   and only started buying from Intel after the alleged exclusivity   ended.Overall, Qualcomm thinks Apple is simply trying to finagle   lower payments -- lower being beneath fair value as established   by its hundreds of other licensing deals with many companies over   the years. That risks somewhat oversimplifying Apple's complaint,   because Apple is also accusing Qualcomm of various forms of   anticompetitive behavior.

BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) DTEK70: Game-Changer or Non-Event?;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rumor mill is spinning again withBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY). Code-named ""Mercury,"" the next BlackBerry device, DTEK70, will reportedly get a Feb. 25 launch date. And BBRY stock holders probably do not care at this point.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrBlackBerry is rebranding itself as a software company, but its stock is up a mere 4.3% in the last year. By comparison,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is up nearly 25% in the last year whileNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), which exited the Windows Phone market and focused on networking, fell 33%.Still, the DTEK70 release is important for BBRY.BlackBerry and TCL PartnershipBlackBerry outsourced its entire hardware development and manufacturing withTCL. Early signs are positive that ""Mercury"" will win customers, especially in the business space. BlackBerry said that it is 100% indevelopingsoftware solutions. TCL's ""Mercury"" build offers a secure Android operating system and has a physical keyboard. The company earns IP and royalty revenue for each device TCL sells.On its conference call in December, BlackBerrydescribedthe TCL deal:This licensing model allows BlackBerry to generate ongoing high margin royalty revenue from a device software based on the number of units sold. We have a pipeline of additional opportunities that are focusing on, including a late discussion in India that are ongoing.""Decent Price to PerformanceBlackBerry priced the budget DTEK50 in the right range but did not win the mainstream market. DTEK60 demonstrated the company's ability to make a solid, high-performance phone at mainstream prices. DTEK70 is even more practical for business users.Rumoredto run on aQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 635 or Snapdragon 821, the device will have just 4.5 inches of screen real estate.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryThis is the magic number for DTEK70: The device may sell for around just $350. At that price and size, business users who crave for higher productivity will snap up this phone when it is launched.Profit MarginBlackBerry CEO John Chen will not allow the company to sell devices at a loss. Assume profit margins in the range of 25%-50% for TCL. When the costs of software development are included, the profit margin for BBRY may run above 50%-60%.Launch DateOn its blog, BlackBerry said it will give more details about the smartphone at the Mobile World Congress show. The event runs from Feb. 27 to March 3.Interest in ""Mercury""+ ""BlackBerry"" jumped:Click to EnlargeSource:tickertags.comGame Changer or More of the Same?Past BlackBerry Android devices did not give the company much revenue growth. In the third quarter, the $172 million in software services revenue accounted for 57% of the company's revenue.The TCL licensing deal, though, is a game-changer for the software company. DTEK70's development costs are all shouldered by its partner. BlackBerry gets a cut in the sales through the software licensing. High profit margins from software sales will translate to more profits for the company.The one big catch is that BBRY and TCL must advertise and promote this upcoming device. BlackBerry made $12 million in operating income in the third quarter.Profit Model for DTEK 70Assuming TCL pays a 10% royalty on the profits of the $350 device, or $20 per device, BlackBerry could earn the following:Units Sold per quarterProfit100,000  $   2,000,000250,000$ 5,000,000 500,000  $ 10,000,000Selling 500,000 units a quarter would match the company's third-quarter operating income.3 Reasons to Buy Ford Motor Company (F) Stock on This DipBottom Line on BBRY StockThe smartphone market is still wide-open for small players like BlackBerry. Previously released Android devices demonstrated the company could deliver on supplying a highly secure, bug-free operating system. The inexpensive DTEK70 targets the business user.With the rumored price and phone specifications, BlackBerry may have an unexpected winner.As of this writing, Chris Lau was long BBRY.

Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you bought and held stock inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) at the height of the dot-com run, it's been an unpleasant 16 years. However, after a long wait, MSFT stock finally reached a new all-time high last month. Despite the tech world changing drastically in the ensuing years, Microsoft's PC dominance lives on, minting money for the company.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrThe company's various new efforts over the years have mostly been flops. There's a reason Microsoft stock has performed poorly; efforts such as Windows phones simply haven't panned out. However, it seems Microsoft has finally turned the corner.It is making real headway in several promising areas, including its cloud offering. And investors have cheered, sending Microsoft's stock up sharply since 2013. Can the good times continue, or will buyers up at these levels be in for another long decade?MSFT Stock ConsHuge Stock Run-Up: Since 2013, MSFT stock has more than doubled. At first glance, that seems fine, the market has performed strongly in recent years after all. However, Microsoft is so large, that it becomes hard to achieve further such doublings. With a market cap just under $500 billion today, even one more double takes Microsoft to a trillion dollar market cap. It's worth asking what the company has going from a growth perspective that could justify such a lofty figure.Sure, the company has some growth initiatives under way. The cloud offering is going well. And the LinkedIn acquisition may start to bear more fruit. But after watching the stock run from under 30 in recent years to over 60 today, you have to ask how much more upside really makes sense, particularly since the company has had near non-existent revenue growth lately.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsHigh Valuation:First things first, MSFT stock isn't really trading at a 30 price-earnings ratio. I know that's what financial websites report. However, that's based on GAAP figures that include one-off losses related to restructuring. On an adjusted basis, Microsoft is trading in the mid-20s, and at 21 times forward earnings. However, even that doesn't paint a flattering picture for the company. Microsoft traded at 12 times earnings or less over much of the past decade. Is Microsoft worth paying twice as much for now?Sure, the PC market has stabilized, but it isn't likely to ever be a meaningful growth driver again. And the newer initiatives such as cloud seem likely to take years to reach strong profitability. At 21 times forward earnings, MSFT stock is pricing in some serious growth prospects that may well not materialize.Questionable Deal-Making:Microsoft has a reputation for making some head-scratching M&A moves. The less said of the aQuantive purchase and the Nokia buy, the better. Those two alone resulted in almost $14 billion of write-offs. And the recent LinkedIn deal raises questions. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn, and offered a massive premium to where shares where trading previously. At the price Microsoft paid, it offered around 30x free cash flow for LinkedIn. On an earnings basis, LinkedIn was still losing money.Sure, Microsoft can cut some costs there, particularly for stock-based compensation, but it's still a massive price tag. And with Microsoft having such a huge war chest on its balance sheet, the temptation will surely be there for the company to make other huge value-destructive deals.MSFT Stock ProsPC Market Stabilizing:For quite a few years now, the traditional PC market appeared to be in serious decline. Sales peaked in 2011, with364 million unitssold that year globally. Since then, sales have plunged. By 2015, sales dropped 24% from that peak year, falling to just 275 million units. And 2016 showed another solid decline, with sales reaching just 260 million units. However, the worst may now have passed. 2020 projections are for 250 million units sold, only a fractional decline from current levels.And themost recent datasupports this further moderation: sales slipped just 1.5% versus the same period last year. And in several areas globally, including Canada and Japan, PC sales are actually increasing again. One possible reason, the rate of forward technological progress has slowed for both tablets and smartphones, reducing pressure on consumers to switch to smaller screens. A stable market would be great news for MSFT stock.Partnership With Qualcomm:Microsoft has partnered withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for their Internet of Things efforts. Qualcomm has entered conflict withIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) at first over the IoT market. In the longer-run, Qualcomm may use its chips to even forcefully attack Intel's long-held dominance in the PC market. In any case, Microsoft benefits nicely from partnering up with Qualcomm.The IoT offerings born from this venture will help spread Windows 10 outside of just the traditional PC market. And given the shellacking that QCOM stock took earlier this week followingApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit against the firm, Qualcomm has reason to deepen ties with friendly partners. As an industry outcast, Qualcomm needs whatever help it can get, and if Microsoft can use that to expand Windows as a broader OS, all the better.Solid Dividend Option:Microsoft has quietly turned into a nice yield choice for more conservative investors. The company has tripled its dividend since 2008. In total, it's posted 16%, 18% and 16% dividend growth rates over the past three, five and ten years. While the payout ratio currently looks a little high, that's based on abnormally soft recent earnings. Make no mistake, there is plenty of room left here for more dividend increases. The company has an astounding $137 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Even after subtracting out debt, the company has a net cash position of $62 billion, leaving plenty of firepower for increased dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions.VerdictMSFT stock is a decent selection if you're purely concerned with its yield and safety. The company's main PC business is looking healthier than it has in quite awhile. The balance sheet is tremendous. The dividend is significant at today's level, and is bound to keep rising quickly.Here's Why Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock Is the Best Play in OilHowever, there's little to recommend Microsoft on valuation. The stock is expensive, even when you look closely. Microsoft has plenty of growth initiatives in the works, but actual operating results recently have only been so-so. When buying stocks at all-time highs, you want to see a business with more operating momentum.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held INTC and QCOM stock. He had no position in Microsoft.

"Can Apple's (AAPL) ""Find my Airpod"" Feature Really Help?";1/26/2017;"On TuesdayApple Inc. (AAPL)announced its iOS 10.3 update with a special feature, apparently called ""Find my Airpods"", that will help to track misplaced Airpods.Powered by a new W1 chip, the Airpods are in line with Apple's vision of wireless future. Apparently, its best feature seems to be the use of sensors to detect if the plugs have been inserted in both the ears. However, since its launch, Airpod has been a hot topic of discussion on FacebookFBand TwitterTWTRgiven the chances of it being misplaced easily due to its size.Per media reports, Apple's announcement can be seen as an answer to users' request to make a feature that will help them find these small AirPods. Due to its small size, the Airpod cannot accommodate a built-in GPS system. Therefore, the latest feature is tailored to locate misplaced Airpods that are within the Bluetooth range of an iPhone or iPad.Then again, the problem remains that the exact location of the Airpod cannot be determined with the feature and only the last connected location will show up on the connected iOS device, add further media reports. Additionally, the feature is capable of activating a sound from the Airpod to indicate its location. However, these features are useless once the Airpod's battery is exhausted.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteApple's fortunes have been tied to its most important offering, the iPhone, which alone contributed about 60% of its total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.However, since the last two quarters, the demand for this device has been soft owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially due to currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe (about 60% of Apple revenues come from International markets).The Airpod had been one of the key attractions of the iPhone 7 series. Reportedly, since the launch of Airpods in December, Apple has been on the top of the headphone market that boasts names likes SonySNE, Bose, JBL and others. Although Apple has refrained from posting its official sales figures, the market reports indicate positive impact of Airpod sales on first quarter results.In the past one year, Apple's shares are up 19.98%, compared with the ZacksComputer Miniindustry's increase of 21.41%, as of Jan 24.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;1/26/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 26, 2017-Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day andValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onApple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) andNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.makeArticleAd();And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T,CiscoorAlphabetare customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApplewith radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.Bear of the Day:I don't enjoy kicking this once-beloved company when it's down, butValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)has it coming (again) as earnings estimates slip.In the past week, another investment bank revised lower their EPS projection for this year, knocking the the Zacks Consensus down to $5.17 from $5.30.And in the past 90 days, the profit outlook has fallen from $7.70. This puts annual growth at -5.6% after a 2016 that could end up at over -30% ""growth.""This is why VRX shares are in the cellar of the Zacks Rank again.But it doesn't mean you should run out and sell yours only $1 from multi-year lows. The company is still projected to deliver nearly $9.2 billion in sales this year with hundreds of products and steady earners like Jublia and Wellbutrin.The unknown risks are what happens with any legal investigations or the company's massive debt load. The current debt-to-equity ratio is over 7X for this $4.7 billion company and the debt-to-capital ratio may be over 87X.Analysts Weigh In On the Debt IssueOn January 11, Canaccord Genuity analyst Neil Maruoka was encouraged by Valeant's recent moves to address the leverage...""Valeant has taken its first significant steps towards de-levering its balance sheet, announcing the divestiture of Dendreon and several dermatology brands (including CereVe) for combined cash consideration of ~$2.1 billion.""The analyst noted that the downside of this move is that the company may be forced to sell more quality drug franchises like CereVe, thus hurting sales and operating cash flow. ""Following these divestitures, we estimate that Valeant will have total debt of $28.3 billion remaining, representing a leverage ratio of 6.9x forward EBITDA (down from 7.1x previously).""On January 20, Deutsche Bank reiterated their Hold rating on VRX shares and dropped their price target from $24 to $20. Analyst Gregg Gilbert talked about the company's challenges...""We expect VRX to provide its 2017 outlook sometime between now and when it reports 4Q results (date not yet set). Recall that management provided 'hand signals' on its 3Q call in November that revenue and EBITDA would be down in 2017 vs. 2016. In anticipation of this event, we have updated our model to reflect recent developments and management commentary. The key elements of our changes relate to recently-announced divestitures, loss of exclusivity (LOE) for several products in 2016/17, and FX headwinds.""Additional content:Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in     IndiaOn Wednesday,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report)executives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.Like many tech corporations-think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) - Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on byTimes of India. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.According toCNNMoney, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country. However, Apple's products are not cheap, and most of India's 1.3 billion people have an average annual income of $1,500.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) virtual reality division Oculus has had a rough six months, but it looks as though the company is ready to to push VR in 2017 and turn things around. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announce thatHugo Barra will be joining FB to lead VR efforts, including Oculus. If the name sounds familiar it should. Barra is very well known in the technology industry.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookSo who is Hugo Barra? He was in the news just last week when it was revealed he was leaving Chinese consumer technology giantXiaomi.He was hired in 2013 to lead that company's efforts to polish its image in western markets and help push its products into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he was returning to his Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.What Does Hugo Barra Bring to FB?Prior to Xiaomi, he served asAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google vice president of Android product management.In his announcement of Barra's hire, Zuckerberg wrote:""I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team. Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting.I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people. Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform.""FB's Oculus ChallengesWhen Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, the prospects for its new virtual reality division seemed limitless. But for the last six months, the division has been struggling.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017Founder Palmer Luckey was bringing inbad press over his political views, complaints over the highprices for its Oculus Rift headsetand the new Touch Controllers continued, andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) unexpectedly began to gain traction with both consumers and game developers with its much more affordable Playstation VR. In December, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down. Now, FB and Luckey aretied up in a lawsuitclaiming the Oculus founder stole trade secrets and violated copyrights in order to develop his Oculus Rift VR headset.On top of all this, the hype over virtual reality is beginning to fade. After being a major part of past Consumer Electronics shows, there was a feeling thatVR wasn't particularly compelling at CES 2017.In short, it's understandable why FB wants to kickstart Oculus. An industry veteran like Hugo Barra -someone who is experienced in leading a critical division in a technology giant and skilled at promotion - may well be the answer.Kickstarting OculusWhen Barra takes over at Oculus, there are a few immediate challenges to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyers will be able to manage most of that.The bigger issue in terms of getting consumers to buy into the Oculus rift is pricing. The Oculus Rift already has mindshare as the VR headset people think of. But where the Oculus Rift was once pretty much the only game in town, every major consumer technology company - exceptApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) - is offering virtual reality gear, and it's almost always cheaper.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)That wouldn't be such a big deal if you were looking at $100 versus $75. But an Oculus Rift plus Touch Controllers goes for $798. Then you need a reasonably powerful PC (many computer owners would have to upgrade), which is at least another $1,000. In comparison, a complete Sony Playstation VR system (including the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstation VR headset is compatible with the original PS4 - which many gamers already own, so that brings their investment to just $500.Largely as a result of those cost differences, it'sestimated Sony will have sold over 745,000 Playstation VR systems in 2016, while projections are for the Oculus Rift to hit just 355,000.The hire of Hugo Barra sets the stage for FB to aggressively promote the technical superiority of its Oculus virtual reality technology over that used by competitors like Sony. It's also a good move in promoting developer relations in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compelling VR content. And if he can find some wiggle room to get Oculus Rift pricing down a bit, Barra stands a good chance of turning things around for Facebook's virtual reality division in 2017.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards this Time?;1/26/2017;"Apple, Inc.AAPLis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 31. Last quarter, it posted a 0.60% positive earnings surprise. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.11%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderInvestors will be looking forward to sales numbers for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. iPhone continues to the primary revenue contributor for Apple. Slowdown in the demand for iPhone has emerged as a big concern for Apple. Over the past one year, sales have dipped given overall weakness in the smartphone market, observe analysts. Per analysts, waning demand from markets like China and U.S., which are Apple's biggest markets, has been widely reflected on iPhone sales numbers.Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone growth in China. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone unit sales came in at about 45.5 million, down 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also declined 13% from the year-ago quarter to $28.2 billion (60% of total revenue).Plus analysts also observe that the hype surrounding iPhone 8 will also dent sales. iPhone 8 is set to be launched later this year, marking the tenth anniversary of the revolutionary iPhone. It reportedly has amazing features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor and wireless charging. What is more exciting is that Apple is rumored to launch three iPhones (instead of two) including a new 5.8 inch model. All this is likely to put consumers on hold for some more time. iPhone 8 is already dubbed as a ""super cycle"".However, given the troubles in iPhone, Apple has been focused on other drivers like Services, Music and App store to boost revenues. A few days back, Apple announced that its App Store generated sales of more than $20 billion for developers in 2016, up 40% from 2015.  Apple keeps 30% of all App Store sales. Apple stated that its top grossing markets were the U.S., China, Japan. China witnessed growth of over 90% year over year.Apple also announced that Apple Music has crossed 20 million paid users. Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices.Plus, it continues to increase focus on emerging markets to boost iPhone sales. In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Also, a robust cash position and shareholder friendly policies are long-term positives.For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $76 billion to $78 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 38.5%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.9 billion to $7 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.Apple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. QuoteEarnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Apple will beat earnings estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

"Western Digital (WDC) Beats Q2 Earnings; '17 View Positive";1/26/2017;"Western Digital Corp.WDCreported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share, which increased 33.7% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings were much better than management's revised guided range of $2.10-$2.15 per share.makeArticleAd();Moreover, including stock-based compensation, earnings were $1.98 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33 cents. Further, revenues of almost $4.89 billion surged 47.4% year over year and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.75 billion.Western Digital witnessed strong demand for both hard drive and NAND-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications, as well as better than expected PC demand in the reported quarter.Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Western Digital Corporation QuoteSegment Revenue DetailsClient devices (49.5% of total revenue) surged 52.9% year over year to $2.42 billion. The revenue synergies from SanDisk acquisition benefitted results in the quarter. Management noted that increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this business.Client solutions (22% of total revenue) increased a whopping 134.4% to $1.08 billion. Robust holiday season sales drove results. The company noted that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew in the quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital announced new retail products including the four terabyte My Passport, eight terabyte My Book for the PC and a new four terabyte hard drive for Apple'sAAPLMacintosh. During the quarter, Western Digital commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of its 64-layer product.Data center devices and solutions (28.5% of total revenue) increased 9.2% to $1.39 billion on the back of strong demand for high capacity storage devices. Petabyte growth of almost 40% year over year for capacity optimized hard drive was in line with management expectations. Solid adoption of 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive was also noted in the quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital shipped 44.8 million HDDs at an average selling price (ASP) of $62, up from $61 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, reported shipments of 44.762 million were down from 49.688 million in the year-ago quarter.Western Digital's market share in the total addressable market (TAM) came in at 39.9% compared with 43.2% in the year-ago quarter.Operating DetailsAdjusted gross margin expanded 810 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.4%. The figure was better than management's guidance of 35%. The expansion was driven by lower product cost and pricing improvement.Reported operating expenses, as percentage of revenues climbed 50 bps to 20.2%, owing to 20 bps increase in research and development (R&D) expense and 10 bps growth in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense.As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded 590 bps to 17.6% in the reported quarter.Interest expense was $224 million a massive increase from $7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Acquisition SynergiesWestern Digital stated that it is on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. The company achieved $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis at the end of the reported quarter.In terms of SanDisk integration, at the end of second quarter the company realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run-rate basis. This is in line with the company's 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.Balance Sheet/Cash FlowAs of Dec 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $4.94 billion up from $4.33 billion as of Sep 30. Long-term debt during the quarter was $12.94 billion down from $13.06 billion at the end of previous quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital generated $1.06 billion in cash from operations compared with $440 million in the previous quarter.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Adjusted gross margin is expected to be 38% backed by continued favorable pricing and product mix across the company's businesses. Total operating expenses are expected to be approximately $800 million.Interest expense is anticipated to be almost $205 million.Management expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $2.00-$2.10 per share for the third quarter.Our TakeWe believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company's growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is significantly positive, in our view.We remain encouraged by the company's launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Continued investments in product innovation could result in flattish margins in the near term.Further, Western Digital's entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.Moreover, the SanDisk acquisition not only expands Western Digital's offerings in the SSD segment but also provides a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate TechnologySTX.We note that Western Digital shares have outperformed the ZacksComputer Storage Devicesindustry in the past one-year. While shares gained 80.9%, the industry advanced 22.4% in the same period. We expect the momentum to persist given the impressive result and positive guidance in the rest of fiscal 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Bull of the Day: Broadcom (AVGO);1/26/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (AVGO)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T(T),Cisco(CSCO), orAlphabet(GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApple (AAPL)with radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.I Have $250... Do I Hear $300?So what has changed in a month to make Broadcom the Bull of the Day again?Simply this: the stock took off over 10% to new highs in the past six sessions as a couple of analysts bolstered their view of this must-own tech ""arms dealer."" While I've been following fund managers into AVGO for nearly 3 years, the growth story is not over.On January 18, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his Top Pick rating on AVGO shares and raised his view of the company's long term earnings potential to $17 EPS on the heels of the acquisition of Brocade (BRCD). Here's what he had to say...""Our analysis suggests the underlying EPS power of AVGO increases materially post BRCD (especially assuming they raise $1.5-2.0B from networking & real estate sales). We think AVGO could achieve >$17.00 of EPS by FY19 (prior $16) and the stock should work in an upside scenario to $250+.""Oddly, the analyst did not raise his existing price target from $200.So we'll leave that to a bolder fan of the company...On January 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenback raised his price target on Broadcom to $240 from $210, and obviously reiterated his Overweight rating. Here's the MS view...""Increasing our PT to $240 from $210 and highlighting a bull case valuation of $300. Our PT is based on a 15X P/E on CY18 EPS, representing a turn increase from the current multiple but still a conservative 20% discount to the high end Semiconductor peers and 15% below the market. AVGO's multiple has been flat (100% of stock appreciation has been driven by growth in EPS) compared to a roughly 2x turn increase in semiconductor stocks, with investors unwilling to pay up for acquired growth.""However, we now have increased conviction that clearer focus on its outperforming core business, materially higher cash returns and ongoing margin expansion will drive a re-rating over the next 6-12 months.""The combination of Avago and Broadcom is unmatched in Networking (40% sales) in our view, which has positive implications for both growth (share gains) and profitability. We also think the company remains well positioned in RF to exploit the next growth driver of carrier aggregation, leveraging its leadership in premium filters and multiplexers.""The AVGO CampaignAnd there you have an update on the continuing saga that I call ""The AVGO Campaign."" It tells you what works and makes you money in a bull market: finding earnings momentum winners that you know institutions will continue to buy until the cycle ends.Consider AVGO your ""playbook stock"" for how to use the Zacks Rank to swing trade fundamentally-strong companies quarter after quarter.You can find out more by following me in myTAZR Traderservice.Zacks' best stocks under $10As a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy, today's Bull of the Day has a short-term 1 to 3-month profit zone.

In October, Alphabet launched its Google Pixel smartphone and a   Google Home voice-activated smart speaker. Yes, the bulk of the   company's revenue will still come from its search and advertising   business, but a high-performing hardware could signal growth   potential.On average, analysts are expecting Alphabet to report   fourth-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $25.18 billion and   9.64, respectively. These results would be up 18% and 11%   compared to the year-ago quarter.Alphabet reports results after market close on Thursday, Jan.   26.Beyond looking to Alphabet's Google-branded hardware and the   company's financial results, investors may want to take the time   to look atthe trajectory of the company's paid clicks and   cost per click-- two important metrics for Alphabet's core search business.iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.Apple: Will guidance point to growth or     decline?When Apple reports results for its first fiscal quarter of   2017 (or the fourth calendar quarter of 2016), one key area to   watch will be the company's guidance. While Apple is expecting   its first-quarter revenue to be slightly higher than in the   year-ago quarter, ending an unfortunate streak of three quarters   of year-over-year declines, it's not clear whether the company   can sustain growth throughout fiscal 2017.Analysts are expecting Apple to report first-quarter revenue   and EPS of $77.4 billion and $3.22. This compares to revenue and   EPS of $75.9 billion and $3.28 in the year-ago quarter.Apple reports its financial results after market close on   Tuesday, Jan. 31.To get a closer look at the metrics that will matter when   Apple reports first-quarter results, here's a more comprehensiveearnings preview.Facebook: Is revenue growth about to slow?The key thing for Facebook investors to watch when the world's   largest social network reports fourth-quarter results will be the   degree to which revenue growth decelerates. Facebook CFO David   Wehner has been warning that revenue growth rates are going to   begin coming down. Of course, with revenue increasing a whopping   56% year over year in Facebook's third quarter, even a meaningful   deceleration in its fourth quarter will still likely represent   big growth for the company.Image source: The Motley Fool.Analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue and   non-GAAP EPS of about $8.49 billion and $1.31, up about 45% and   66%, respectively. Therefore, analysts do expect Facebook's   business growth to decelerate, but not too significantly.Facebook reports fourth-quarter results after market close on   Wednesday, Feb. 1.For a more in-depth overview of what to expect from Facebook's   earnings report, check out thisearnings preview.Stay tuned at The Motley Fool for more coverage of these   companies throughout earnings season.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Earnings: Why QCOM Stock Is A Buy;1/25/2017;"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are edging lower in the after-market session Wednesday, down about 1.3% even though the wireless chip giant reported fiscal first quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the bottom-line miss, it’s tough to ignore the potential value QCOM stock presents.Indeed, Qualcomm is facing some battles. Still, I would place a bet here on QCOM shares, which are priced at just 12 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $4.74 per share. Trading in the after-hour session at around $55, QCOM stock should reach $62 to $65 in the next 12 to 18 months delivering 18% returns. And the gains could go higher assuming its legal battle with Apple (AAPL) gets resolved, as I expect it will.The company’s guidance, for instance, underscores the extent to which the management remains focus on execution. For the second quarter, Qualcomm is forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.25. This compares favorably toThomson Reuters forecast of about $1.20 a share. This make Qualcomm — from a valuation perspective — easy to like at current levels. I’ll get back to that in a moment. Let’s go through he numbers.makeArticleAd();Forthe quarter that ended December, the San Diego-based company reported a net income of $700 million, or 46 cents a share, down from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, the company would have earned $1.19 a share, which beat analysts estimates by a penny. First quarter revenue rose 4% year over year to $6 billion, but fell shy on estimates of $6.12 billion.“We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf in a staement. “Looking ahead, the pending NXP acquisition accelerates our strategic transformation in the high growth areas of automotive, IoT, security and networking. We are very well positioned to lead as the semiconductor engine for the intelligent, connected world.”Revenue in the licensing business (Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)), which sells sells applications processors and cellular baseband devices, grew 13% year over year to $1.8 billion, while QCT revenue, which exists to monetize Qualcomm immense IP portfolio, came in at $4.1 billion. These gains offset revenue in Mobile station modem (MSM) chip shipments, which includes the Snapdragon LTE modem, which declined 10% year over year $217 million.Ahead of the quarter, analysts were also looking to see if the company discusses its $38 billion purchase of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductor (NXPI). Qualcomm said it expects the transaction — subject to regulatory approval — to close by the end of 2017. What’s more, the company said during the quarter,  $1.2 billion was returned to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends."
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has had an impressive run over the past few years. Heading into Thursday's fiscal second quarter earnings report, MSFT stock is right near an all-time high, having increased about 150% over the past few years.Source:Via MicrosoftWhat's interesting about the gains for such a large stock - MSFT is the third-most valuable company on U.S. markets, behind onlyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) - is that they haven't been based on Microsoft earnings. Microsoft's EPS was $2.73 in fiscal 2012, and $2.79 in fiscal 2016.makeArticleAd();Rather, the multiple investors assign to MSFT stock has expanded. It has more than doubled, in fact.That multiple expansion has come from increasing confidence toward Microsoft'sfutureearnings potential, most notably in mobile and cloud. Where investors four to five years ago saw a fading giant whose earnings were likely to decline, Microsoft now looks like a sleeping giant. And investors clearly believe the company's self-described ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy is going to push Microsoft earnings up - at some point.It's in that context that the market will analyze the Microsoft earnings report due on Thursday.Microsoft's Growth Isn't There…YetIt's always dangerous for an investor to believe that the numbers don't matter, but in the case of MSFT stock, the numbers really aren't the most important thing right now.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017Analyst consensus - informed in large part by Microsoft earnings guidance - doesn't predict a particularly impressive second quarter earnings report. The Street expects EPS to rise just a penny year-over-year, which given share repurchases, implies that Microsoft's total net profits actually will be lower in Q2 FY17 than they were ago.  Revenue is estimated to fall almost 2% year-over-year.Microsoft's guidance projects growth in its Productivity & Business and Intelligent Cloud segments, but a sharp decline in More Personal Computing.That shouldn't be surprising. Office 365 growth has helped business revenue, and the Azure platform continues to be a worthy, if still much smaller, competitor to Amazon Web Services in cloud. It's the potential for success in those products that has offset fears about continuing pressure on revenue from Windows, as PC sales decline and mobile usage increases.Indeed, the gain in MSFT stock from $27 to $63 has come mostly from the transition.The fears of Windows losses that led MSFT stock to be valued around 10x EPS in 2013 have turned to optimism toward growth in Azure, Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and other areas. That optimism has pushed the same stock to be valued at about 21x FY17 earnings.So it seems unlikely that investors will focus on the major headline numbers coming out of the Microsoft earnings report. A beat or miss of a penny or two on earnings likely isn't going to drive the market's reaction to the report - particularly if that weakness comes from Windows. Rather, the focus is going to be on the growing, smaller, businesses, most notably Azure.There's a reason Microsoft has steadily expanded its disclosure around Azure and cloud growth: That's where investor attention has been. And it seems likely that's where investor attention will stay coming out of the Q2 Microsoft earnings report.What to Watch For in Microsoft EarningsInvestors seem likely to have some patience with a modest miss in the Microsoft earnings report, as expectations remain relatively low. The company still is getting out from under its deal withNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), and layoffs this year should provide a boost to margins over the next few quarters. Wall Street in particular isn't expecting growth to pick up until fiscal 2018, where sales are projected to grow more than 6% against a rate under 2% in fiscal 2017.So what seems to be important in the Q2 Microsoft earnings report is whether the base of that growth is intact.While Azure is estimated to generate just 3% of total revenue,accordingto analyst firm MKM Partners, its growth rate certainly will be watched closely. After a 140% increase in Q2 FY16, and 116% last quarter, any slowdown seems likely to hurt the stock. But another 100%-plus figure would give further evidence that Azure is a worthy competitor to AWS, and support the current MSFT stock price.The cloud business as a whole - including Office 365 and Dynamics, which is trying to take share fromSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) - will be another area of post-earnings analysis.Here's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock     Will Hit $75What does that mean for Microsoft stock coming out of the Microsoft earnings report?Overall, it means that the quarter seems likely to be judged more on ""feel"" than on the hard numbers. Even though cloud and mobile still aren't the majority of MSFT revenue or earnings, they are the cornerstones of the Microsoft strategy going forward. And for now, it's relatively clear that the market is content to wait for those sales and profits - as long as it continues to trust in that strategy.If Microsoft can deliver another earnings report that shows growth is on the horizon, MSFT stock likely will rise - even if the headline numbers aren't perfect. But if there's any sort of stumble in either cloud or mobile, that investor patience could reverse - quickly.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW     Still Bargains7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI     MonsterThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Previewappeared first onInvestorPlace."
3 ETF Myths And 4 Trading Tips From The Man Who Helped Launch SPY;1/25/2017;"Why is SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), beloved of so many investors in exchange traded funds, like an   Apple (AAPL) iPhone? In both cases, the teams who helped launch the products   did not anticipate they would revolutionize an industry.""When we designed SPY, we had no idea how flexible the ETF   vehicle would turn out to be,"" Jim Ross, chairman of the global   SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors, said Tuesday at   the 10th annual Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. ""We   could not have imagined all the innovative ways ETFs are being   used today.""Ross, who was part of the team that launched SPY 24 years ago,   made that point as he drew a parallel between the iPhone's impact   on the technology industry and ETFs' transformation of the   investment landscape.makeArticleAd();As U.S. ETFs enter their 25th year, the ETF industry is   cheering both the fact that this investment vehicle holds a total   of more than $2 trillion in assets and that ETFs represent less   than 5% of the investable market - meaning, there's still plenty   of room to grow.ETFs certainly continue to be on a hot growth streak. ""ETF   assets have roughly doubled every three years over the past   decade,"" Ross said at a conference session titled ""The ETF   Revolution And What's Next For ETFs."" He said that there is no   reason why global ETF assets cannot cross $16 trillion by 2025 at   the continued annual growth rate of 19%.Driving demand for, and innovative use of, ETFs are a host of   insurance companies, ETF strategists, sovereign wealth funds,   wealth management firms and even mutual funds, he added.But Ross also pointed out that risks tied toETF   investinginclude a persistent lack of understanding about these   investment vehicles. In his afternoon address, he sought to   debunk common myths about ETFs and offered some tips for trading   ETFs.Myth 1:""ETF liquidity (issues) could blow up the fixed-income   market."" Despite this common perception, ETFs comprise less than   1% of the total fixed-income market, Ross said. That makes it   unlikely they will ""blow up"" an entire market.In fact, Ross believes fixed-income ETFs can be more efficient   than other fixed-income products, as assets in them have   continued to increase to more than $400 billion today. And   although the underlying fixed-income market can be opaque,   fixed-income ETFs offer transparency in terms of trading costs   and portfolio holdings, he added.Myth 2:""ETFs gone wild."" Referring to the belief that the   proliferation of ETFs can harm investors, Ross said he believes   ETF issuers like his own company are diligent about making sure   new launches meet existing needs. Even a crudely constructed ETF,   he added, displays the American value of ""take an idea to market   and test it out.""The lesson here, Ross said, is that ""all ETF investors need to   understand what they are buying, when they are buying.""Myth 3:""ETFs fail to track intrinsic value in volatile markets.""   According to Ross, ETFs have in some cases helped the process of   price discovery in challenging markets.""That happened on Aug. 24 (2015),"" he said. ""SPY traded   efficiently throughout the day"" despite the extreme volatility inthe stock marketthat day.Ross noted, too, that following that day's tradingdisruptions in some stocks and ETFs, an ETF industry coalition took action to harmonize exchange   rules to address the issue.The lesson here, Ross added, is to understand ETF trading   basics:1. If you don't have to trade in volatile markets, don't.2. Don't trade near the market open. Volatility tends to be   high as the markets price in the news.3. Use limit orders. These are generally seen to have   advantages over market orders in terms of price control and   protection.4. Reconsider the use of stop orders. As many ETF investors   unhappily discovered on Aug. 24, stop orders become market orders   once the price is hit. And they run the risk of selling for much   below their intended price in serious market disruptions.A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price   of the stock reaches a specified price. A limit order is an order   to buy or sell a stock at a specified price or better.Introducing Ross to the audience, Inside ETFs CEO Matt Hougan   made note of Ross' leadership role in the industry for more than   two decades.""There's a reason everyone loves him,"" Hougan said. ""He's the   chairman of the ICI (Investment Company Institute) ETF committee.   He does education everywhere he can.""The Inside ETFs conferenceconcludes Wednesday.RELATED:The 'Trump ETFs' Spotlighted As 6 Best     Investment Ideas For 2017"
