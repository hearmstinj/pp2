Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions Inc. vs. Infinera;January 28, 2017, 03:46:00 PM EDT;Investing in the tech sector can be tricky. Competition     tends to be fierce, which makes it difficult to stay one step     ahead. Two companies that have a strong history of maintaining     their edge are;Skyworks Solutions;(NASDAQ: SWKS)  and;Infinera;(NASDAQ: INFN) . Both of these businesses have been taking     market share in their industries for years, which is     impressive. But which of these two tech companies is the better     investment today? Let's review the bull thesis for each company     so we can make an informed decision.;Image source: Getty Images.;"makeArticleAd();";The case for Skyworks Solutions;Skyworks designs and builds chips that allow devices to   connect to each other. The company's semiconductors are found in   a wide range of products such as routers, tablets, cars, and   smartphones.;While this industry is quite competitive, Skyworks' unique   ability to create custom and complex solutions for its customers   has given it a big edge over rivals. In fact, Skyworks chips can   currently be found in nearly all of the top-selling smartphones   in the world, including those made by;Samsung;, Xiaomi, and;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) .;The massive boom in smartphone sales over the last few   years has been a godsend for Skyworks. The company's revenue,   margins, and profits have all soared, which has taken long-term   investors on a lucrative ride.;SWKS;data by;YCharts;With the Internet of Things ramping up and 5G technology set   to deploy, Skyworks looks well positioned to continue delivering   for investors from here. However, Skyworks does have   an Achilles heel that investors should be aware of.   Apple is responsible for more than 40% of Skyworks' total   revenue, which is a blessing and a curse. When iPhone sales are   booming, Skyworks' results soar. However, when the Mac maker   decides to reduce its channel inventory, Skyworks really;feels the pain;.;While Skyworks has been signing deals in recent years to help   reduce its customer concentration, Apple is such a huge component   of Skyworks revenue that these two companies will remain attached   at the hip -- for better or worse -- for the foreseeable   future.;The case for Infinera;Infinera is a fast growing player in the   optical networking equipment market. The company's products   make internet providers lives easier by allowing them to easily   (and cheaply) move vast quantities of data around the globe.;Like Skyworks, Infinera has also benefited from a number of   tech trends. The rise of cloud computing and streaming high-def   video is making it difficult for providers to keep up with   demand. That's forcing them to invest huge sums of money to   expand their networks, which has been a boon to Infinera's   business.;Image source: Getty Images.;That's a wonderful backdrop, but Infinera has;struggled;over the last few quarters to translate that bandwidth   demand growth into financial success. While there are several   factors to blame, one of the biggest problems is   competition.;Ciena;-- a much larger rival -- has caught up to Infinera's   technological edge and has been eating the company's lunch as of   late. While Infinera's management is aware of the problem and is   investing heavily to recapture its edge, it might be a long-haul   until the company returns to top-line growth.;Of course, those worries have now been;priced into the company's stock;, so investors could be in a position to win big if the company   can grow faster than market watchers expect.;The better buy;While I'm hopeful that Infinera can right its ship, there are   never any guarantees of success. For that reason, I think that   the better choice for investors today is Skyworks. Not only does   Skyworks promise high growth rates ahead, but it is already so   profitable that it pays out a fast-growing dividend and still   has enough cash left over to;buy back boatloads of stock;. As long as the company can continue to make progress at fixing   its customer concentration issues, then its future is looking   quite bright.;10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     Solutions;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Chronological History of How Qualcomm Became the Most Powerful Apple Supplier Ever;January 28, 2017, 12:00:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;If you read through;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) blockbuster lawsuit against;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) , there's quite a bit of animosity toward how   Qualcomm conducted its business with Apple over the years. This   was not a pleasant relationship -- at least according to   Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";Instead, this relationship was skewed significantly in favor   of Qualcomm, and there wasn't a whole lot that Apple could do   since the iPhone fundamentally relies on cellular connectivity.   This is easily the only time that Apple has not had the upper   hand with a supplier relationship. Look no further than Apple's   own;negotiating tactics;with now-defunct GT Advanced to see how hard Apple could squeeze   its suppliers. Yet Qualcomm was able to become the most powerful   Apple supplier ever.;"This story has at least a decade of history that you need to   know to fully appreciate why Apple felt desperate enough to sue.   ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it,"" said   CEO Tim Cook in 2014, so we know Apple isn't trigger-happy when   it comes to suing. The Mac maker simply had enough. Note that   what follows is largely Apple's side, as laid out in the   complaint. Qualcomm will of course offer a different   perspective.";That being said, let's start from the beginning.;2007: Apple introduces the original iPhone;Much of Qualcomm's patent portfolio is considered essential to   cellular standards that enable modern mobile devices to connect   to cellular networks, which is the foundation of its licensing   business. Standards-essential patents (SEPs) must be licensed to   anyone, including competitors, at fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates.;Apple initially sourced baseband modems from Infineon, which   was subsequently acquired by;Intel;, for the first four years. Even before Apple ever bought its   first Qualcomm baseband, it had to pay licensing fees indirectly   through its contract manufacturers. Apple attempted to negotiate   a direct license with Qualcomm, but was unable to, according to   its complaint:;Apple has been indirectly paying Qualcomm licensing fees     since 2007, when it released the iPhone.;...;"In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone using Intel (then     Infineon) baseband processor chipsets. Qualcomm required     licensing fees for using these chipsets. Rather than grant     Apple a direct license on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has instead     entered into confidential licenses with specific Apple contract     manufacturers (""CMs""), the third-party manufacturers who make     and assemble Apple products. The CMs pay the exorbitant     royalties Qualcomm demands and pass the costs along to Apple in     full.";"As a way to get relief on excessive royalties, Apple entered   into a ""Marketing Incentive Agreement"" with Qualcomm in 2007 that   prohibited it from marketing WiMAX devices, an emerging 4G   standard that would compete with LTE -- and which Qualcomm lacks   meaningful patents for. Obviously, if Apple can't market a   device, it won't make said device. While this was before Apple   became a major player in the smartphone market, this agreement   certainly contributed to WiMAX's death.";It was around 2007 that Qualcomm allegedly stopped licensing   its SEPs to rivals, and began charging separately for licenses.   This violated the;patent exhaustion doctrine;of patent law.;"Around 2007, Qualcomm's practice of licensing its     FRAND-encumbered cellular SEPs to competitors changed. In 2006,     Qualcomm's 10-K stated that it entered into ""License     Agreements"" with competing chipset manufacturers, and received     royalties thereunder. In Qualcomm's 2007 10-K, the term     ""License Agreements"" was replaced by ""Agreements."" Qualcomm's     2008 10-K provided that in ""every case, these agreements do not     allow such integrated circuit suppliers to pass through rights     under Qualcomm's patents to such suppliers' customers, and such     customers' sales of CDMA-based wireless subscriber device into     which such suppliers' integrated circuits are incorporated are     subject to the payment of royalties to us in accordance     with the customers' separate licensing arrangements with     us.""";...;Since at least 2007, Qualcomm has engaged in systematic,     continuous conduct to exclude competition in the relevant     chipset markets.;2008: Turmoil in the baseband market;In January,;Analog Devices;exited the baseband market by selling its baseband business to   MediaTek for $350 million in cash. MediaTek was one of the few   remaining baseband companies.;In October, Freescale announced that it was discontinuing   all mobile chips, including basebands, RF transceivers, and   more.;2009: Joint ventures, negotiations, and regulatory   actions;Ericsson;and;STMicroelectronics;formed a joint venture, ST-Ericsson, in order to target the   mobile market, including basebands, among other chips.;Knowing that it wanted to eventually release an iPhone that   could connect to CDMA networks, Apple started to lay the   foundation of procuring baseband chipsets from Qualcomm in the   near future. Incredibly, Apple was unable to get Qualcomm to   commit to its supply requirements, a standard ask of prospective   suppliers. On the contrary, Qualcomm specifically retained the   right to withhold chips as leverage.;"The 2009 Strategic Terms Agreement (""STA"") addresses the     process by which Qualcomm supplies chipsets and associated     software to Apple. It also restricts Apple's ability to sue     Qualcomm for patent infringement concerning Qualcomm chipsets.     While Apple generally negotiates firm supply commitments with     its component vendors, Qualcomm refused to provide Apple such a     commitment, instead arbitrarily capping its liability for     failure to supply, and reserving for itself the ability to     terminate its obligation to supply chipsets to Apple's CMs.     Qualcomm's unilateral right to terminate supply of chipsets to     Apple's CMs was retained in the Amended and Restated Strategic     Terms Agreement (""ASTA""), effective February 28, 2013.";During this year, Qualcomm also found itself subject to   regulatory investigations in both Japan and South Korea over its   shenanigans.;"The Japan Fair Trade Commission (""JFTC"") has been     investigating Qualcomm since 2006. In September 2009, the JFTC     concluded that Qualcomm violated the Japanese Antimonopoly Act     by forcing licensees to cross-license their patents on a     royalty-free basis and agree to a non-assert provision, and     ordered the company to cease these practices.";...;In July 2009, the KFTC levied the largest fine it had ever     imposed on a company -- $207 million -- on Qualcomm for abusing     its dominant share of the CDMA chipset market.;Note that this 2009 Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine is   separate from another one that the KFTC just imposed a few weeks   ago.;2011: Apple launches the iPhone on Verizon, and Qualcomm's   exclusivity begins;This was a big one. In many ways, this was the year that Apple   fully;got into bed with Qualcomm;, largely because;Verizon;'s 3G network uses CDMA instead of GSM. As the largest U.S.   carrier, it was an important strategic move for Apple ahead of   the scheduled end of;AT&T;exclusivity. Fully aware of this, Qualcomm flexed its licensing   muscles:;Apple became even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due to     Apple's desire to release an iPhone that could connect to CDMA     networks, such as Verizon's.;...;Since 2011, when Apple introduced the first CDMA version of     its products, Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium     for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other respects     identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality     enabled. Qualcomm prices its CDMA chipsets without regard to     competitive alternatives.;Qualcomm's exclusivity in supplying;all;baseband chipsets began in 2011. Seeking relief from excessive   royalties, Qualcomm gave Apple rebates that were contingent upon,   among other things, exclusivity. We're talking about billions of   dollars:;Specifically, since 2011, Qualcomm has conditioned billions     of dollars in rebates on exclusivity or de facto exclusivity     from Apple.;This exclusivity ended just a few months ago, with Intel   coming on board as a second supplier. The timing of this lawsuit   is surely not a coincidence.;NVIDIA;announced in May that it is acquiring Icera's baseband and RF   assets for $367 million, with the hopes of both addressing the   baseband market as well as integrating cellular connectivity into   its new Tegra line of mobile chips.;2012: Bye, TI;After deciding to exit the baseband market four years prior,;Texas Instruments;continued its planned;exit of the mobile chip market;. TI discontinued its OMAP applications processors, and kept   ratcheting down its baseband business. TI had still been   making baseband for a few prominent customers, but now planned to   wind them down completely by year's end.;2013: Another agreement, another exit, and another regulatory   investigation;Apple kicked off 2013 with a new Business Cooperation and   Patent Agreement (BCPA) that took effect on the first day of the   year. This was simply an agreement intended in part to provide   royalty relief. This BCPA also had the provision that Apple could   not instigate or induce any regulatory investigations, although   Apple was allowed to cooperate if approached.;In general, the BCPA, effective January 1, 2013, provided certain incentives to Apple in exchange for     specifically defined business     cooperation, and provided Qualcomm certain rights to Apple     s patents. The BCPA expired     on December 31, 2016, and is attached hereto as     Exhibit A.;...;From 2013 through mid-2016, Apple received quarterly rebates     from Qualcomm, including the rebates required under the BCPA,     called BCP Payments.;In other words, Apple didn't even wait a full month following   the BCPA's expiration to file suit.;Ericsson and STMicroelectronics decided to dissolve the   ST-Ericsson joint venture, with Ericsson taking over baseband   modem products. It would exit soon.;Broadcom;agreed in September to acquire the 4G LTE assets from   Japan-based Renesas for $164 million.;China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)   began its anti-monopoly investigation in November.;2014: Even more regulatory investigations;Broadcom announced in June that it would;formally exit;the baseband market, and would attempt to sell its baseband   assets. The company expected to save $700 million in annual   operating expenses as a result. CEO Scott McGregor would later   say that Broadcom was losing $2 million;per day;by trying to compete in the baseband market. Of the initial 2,500   estimated layoffs, McGregor said 500 employees were able to find   other positions at Broadcom, but 2,000 workers were let go.;No wonder companies kept exiting the baseband modem market.     Image source: Intel Investor Meeting 2014.;Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European   Commission opened their own investigations, commencing in   September and October, respectively.;Apple attempted yet again to negotiate a direct license,   knowing that several agreements would expire in less than two   years. It was unsuccessful.;Discussions dating back to at least     November 2014 between Apple and Qualcomm about a     direct license for certain patents were conducted with     the knowledge that certain of the agreements governing the     parties' commercial relationship, such as the TA and BCPA,     were set to expire at the end of 2016.;Roughly a year and a half after ST-Ericsson's dissolution,   Ericsson also bailed on basebands, cutting 1,000 jobs in the   process.;2015: Qualcomm makes peace with China, attempts to with   Apple;In February, Qualcomm settled with China's NDRC and negotiated   a rectification plan. The company paid the $975 million fine in   full and agreed to modify its business practices in the Middle   Kingdom. Qualcomm began charging royalty rates of 5% for 3G CDMA   and WCDMA devices, including multimode devices that use both 3G   and 4G. 4G devices that do not use CDMA fetch 3.5%. In both   cases, that percentage is levied on a royalty base of 65% of the   device's net selling price. Qualcomm offered these terms to   Apple, but Apple rejected them, not believing that the offer was   consistent with FRAND.;Four years after acquiring Icera's baseband assets, NVIDIA   announced in May that it would wind down its Icera baseband   operations, conceding defeat to Qualcomm.;Marvell;"announced a ""significant restructuring"" of its mobile platform,   also";bailing on mobile chips;"like basebands and applications processors. Annualized operating   expense savings were estimated at $170 million to $220 million;   Marvell laid off 17% of its employees.";"The European Commission sent Qualcomm two formal   Statements of Objection in December based on its preliminary   conclusions that ""the company may have illegally paid a major   customer for exclusively using its chipsets and sold chipsets   below cost with the aim of forcing a competitor out of the   market."" Well, now we know who that major customer is, although   Apple wasn't named at the time.";2016: The end of exclusivity;Apple approached Qualcomm once again in February looking for a   direct license. During discussions, Qualcomm disagreed on which   patents may or may not be in fact essential, and the company   removed a public list of its patents from its website.;On February 5, 2016, Apple reiterated its interest in     exploring a direct license to certain patents in Qualcomm's     patent portfolio.;...;Apple rejected Qualcomm's attempt to shirk its burden to     prove the merits of its claims. Qualcomm thereafter removed     from its website its public list of U.S. patents disclosed to     [European Telecommunications Standards Institute] and precluded     archive searching of that list. Consistent with Qualcomm's     other hide-the-ball behavior, this action makes it harder for a     licensee to determine which patents Qualcomm has declared to be     essential to cellular standards.;Qualcomm's exclusivity as Apple's baseband supplier ended in   the spring.;The KFTC requested information from Apple, and Apple testified   to the KFTC in August. Less than a month later, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding the quarterly Q2 rebate payment   outlined by the BCPA that Apple had earned as of June 30 but   wasn't due to be paid until September. Qualcomm hasn't paid the   subsequent two quarterly payments, either. The $1 billion that   Apple is seeking comprises three quarterly payments.;2017: Back to the future;That more or less brings us up to speed with how Qualcomm   extracted exclusivity from Apple, which was a key factor in   pushing out rivals. Apple is by far the largest purchaser of   stand-alone modems, and missing out on that business was utterly   fatal for rivals' baseband ambitions. In Apple's words:;This conduct has foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from     dealing with Apple, a key purchaser of chipsets, leading to the     marginalization and exit of many of those competitors, and to     the acquisition and maintenance by Qualcomm of monopoly power.     But-for Qualcomm's conduct as alleged herein, rival chipset     manufacturers would have become stronger competitors to     Qualcomm.;No other Apple supplier in history has been able to wield such   power over the Cupertino company. The key differentiator was   Qualcomm's massive patent portfolio, combined with its   willingness to disregard industry norms as well as its own FRAND   licensing commitments. Perhaps more importantly for Apple going   forward, there will probably never be another supplier with this   much power ever again.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;January 28, 2017, 08:15:00 AM EDT;There's a lot to get to this week in solar, so let's dive   right in.;The fast and furious progress of solar energy;"In 2011, then Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy   Steven Chu launched the SunShot initiative with a goal of cutting   the cost of installing a utility-scale solar system for $1 per   watt by 2020. At the time, I called the 74% reduction in the cost   of solar in a decade """;an audacious goal;".""";Image source: Getty Images.;"makeArticleAd();";Less than six years later and three years ahead of schedule,   I'm here to say that I underestimated the solar industry.   Projects are being built for less than $1 per watt today, and   cost reductions continue to amaze even the most bullish   observers. Everything from solar panels to inverters to   permitting costs have come down in the last six years with the   SunShot program helping with the reductions. And $1 per-watt   solar will lead to a whole new surge in demand, which is very   bullish for solar companies around the world.;Apple and NV Energy find common ground;Berkshire Hathaway;(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) subsidiary NV Energy has taken its   share of lumps from the renewable energy industry over the last   few years. Solar advocates helped drive a ballot measure in   November that will give customers more choice than buying energy   from the monopoly. And casino companies, which are its largest   customers, are starting to;cut their ties to the utility;and buy energy elsewhere.;NV Energy may be learning that it can't take such an   adversarial approach to renewable energy and customers' desires   to buy renewables after agreeing to help Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)   build a 200 MW solar power plant by early 2019. The utility will   buy energy from the solar plant and sell the energy to Apple for   a data center in Reno, continuing Apple's growth in solar   adoption.;Corporate customers will likely be big drivers of renewable   energy in 2017, demanding clean energy to power their businesses   around the country. Maybe utilities are finally learning that   it's better to go along with the renewable-energy revolution than   fight it and lose their customers to someone else.;Don't freak out about the ITC... yet;The solar industry is abuzz with speculation about the solar   investment tax credit (ITC), which helps fund every solar project   in the country today. The subsidy was extended at the end of 2015   and is currently set to start;stepping down from 30% in 2019;to a permanent 10% from commercial projects, and 0% for   residential projects, starting in 2022.;It's no secret that most of the new Trump Administration is   less in favor of renewable energy than the past administration,   so there's concern the ITC could be in trouble. But comments from   Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin in support of wind   subsidies, and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson in   relation to climate change, have eased some of those   tensions.;Keep in mind that the ITC stepdown is current law and would   require an act of Congress, including 60 votes in the Senate, to   be repealed. I think that's unlikely to happen, especially when   you consider the 200,000+ jobs in solar and extreme popularity of   the energy source. The ITC seems safe, despite the likelihood   that it's unpopular inside the White House. Unless something   changes, solar investors can breathe a sigh of relief.;News and notes;Here are the other notable items of the week that investors   shouldn't lose sight of.;Eos Energy Storage and;Siemens;(NASDAQOTH: SIEGY);announced a partnership;to integrate, install, and service utility-scale energy-storage   solutions. It's hard to state how big it is that a giant in   electricity-distribution equipment is taking a role in energy   storage, which will help solar provide more value to the grid. We   don't know exactly what will happen with the partnership in terms   of costs or demand for utility-scale storage, but the fact that   it's on the radar of giants of the industry is big for renewable   energy.;Pattern Energy Group;(NASDAQ: PEGI) announced the closing of $350 million in senior   notes due 2024 with a 5.875% interest rate. The financing will   help the company pay down short-term debt and acquire more   renewable-energy projects. If this is a sign that yieldco   financing is opening up, it would be good for the entire   industry.;Canadian Solar;(NASDAQ: CSIQ) signed a contract earlier this week with the   Sacramento Municipal Utility District to sell energy from a 60 MW   solar farm over the course of 20 years starting in mid-2017.   There haven't been a lot of big contract signings in the U.S.   over the past year, so any movement in the space is notable, even   if 60 MW is only about 1% of Canadian Solar's annual   manufacturing capacity.;10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Image source: Microsoft.;When;Microsoft;(NASDAQ: MSFT) first launched its;Surface lineup in 2012;, I had my doubts as to whether or not the company could   successfully jump into hardware. The company has had its fair   share of missteps for the Surface, but it's safe to say at this   point that Microsoft has exceeded most early expectations for its   first-party devices. Microsoft has adapted quickly to flops like   Surface RT, which resulted in a $900 million writedown back in   2013, and pushed forward with expanding the portfolio, most   recently with Surface Studio.;"makeArticleAd();";Surface revenue during the fourth quarter came in at $1.3   billion, representing a sequential increase of over 40% for the   busy holiday shopping season. That's enough to bring full-year   2016 Surface revenue to an impressive $4.3 billion.;Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author. Calendar years     shown.;It also probably helps that CEO Satya Nadella is a stronger   leader than his predecessor, even though the Surface strategy was   conceived under Steve Ballmer. The push with Surface hardware   created a rift between Ballmer and Bill Gates, and may have also   contributed to Ballmer's ouster.;Out with the old, in with the new;During the earnings call, Nadella noted that Surface has   enjoyed three consecutive quarters of 25%-plus growth. Sales mix   is transitioning toward the newer products like Surface Pro 4 and   Surface Book, and Surface 3 sales are expected to continue   winding down.;The customer reception for Surface Studio in particular has   been strong, which is especially impressive for two reasons:   Surface Studio was not widely available during the fourth   quarter, and it's extremely expensive, starting at $3,000.   Inventories for the new all-in-one should start improving this   quarter as production ramps up.;Taking a bite out of Apple;More broadly, Surface is but part of a bigger push among the   Windows PC crowd to take a bite out of;Apple;"'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) turf: the premium PC market. Surface is doing   well, but it was never expected to comprise a large chunk of the   Windows ecosystem; that's what original equipment manufacturers   (OEMs) are for.";"CFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft's ""OEM non-pro performance   should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the premium   device category."" In other words, high-end consumer-oriented PCs   made by Microsoft's partners are gaining traction in the market,   at a time when Apple lost PC market share for the";first three quarters;of 2016 (Apple reports fourth-quarter results next week). OEM   non-pro revenue grew 5% last quarter, outpacing the broader PC   market.;Surface is profitable, too;It's also worth pointing out that Surface is now profitable on   a gross margin basis (up 6% last quarter in dollar terms), so   those revenue gains are starting to enjoy some operating   leverage.;Unfortunately, currency headwinds are adversely impacting   profitability, as Surface gross margin was up 17% on a constant   currency basis in dollar terms. There's a big discrepancy between   the currency impacts on revenue (2 percentage points) compared to   gross margin (11 percentage points), which is due to the fact   that Surface devices are manufactured in Asia and the Surface   cost structure is more vulnerable to currency fluctuations.;Still, you have to give Nadella credit for being able to take   a struggling segment conceived under Ballmer and turn it into a   profitable $4.3 billion business within just a couple of   years.;10 stocks we like better than Microsoft;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft wasn't one of     them!

10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great;January 27, 2017, 03:07:22 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;"Amidst the bombast, braggadocio and fact-free claims of the 2016 presidential campaign, perhaps the most effective was the subtext contained in President Trump's incessantly cited mantra, ""Make America Great Again.""";"makeArticleAd();";Source: Shutterstock;The implication of this successful sonnet of sloganism is that America is not great, at least not in its current iteration. And while certainly an effectual rhetorical rallying point for the most disaffected voters, the claim fails to hold up to scrutiny when one takes a more lucid view of the corporate and investing landscape.;Indeed, there are scores of companies, and scores of stocks to own, that already make America great. These are the companies that make the products and services that Americans organize their lives around. Creators of communication devices, social media networks and information retrieval services are just a few of the brilliant achievements of entrepreneurial Americans that have made the country great through the genius of their ideas.;7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018;They're also among the top companies, and the top stocks, that make our nation great for investors. If you want to feel good about the country, and about the prospects for long-term portfolio performance, here are 10 stocks to own that;already;make America great.;Stocks to Buy: Boeing (BA);Source:;Phillip Capper via Flickr;Premier American aircraft manufacturer;Boeing Co;(NYSE:;BA;) also is one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. The company supplies Western military forces with the F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, which also are capable of precision strategic bombing runs crucial to defeating enemies such as the Islamic State.;Just check out this footage of an F-18 delivering ISIS fighters a dead-on strike with a;500-lb laser guided bomb;[Graphic content warning] and you'll be convinced of the efficacy of its fighter jets in the effort against a determined, well-funded and ideologically inspired army.;"Yet Boeing is far more than just a builder of military hardware. The company's iconic ""7 Series"" passenger jets - the 747, 737, 777 and 787 - have allowed not just Americans, but travelers worldwide to speed off to their destinations safely, and in style. If you want evidence of American corporate greatness, just look to the sky near any major metropolitan airport. You're sure to spot the greatness of Boeing in flight.";Stocks to Buy:;Amazon.com (AMZN);Source: Shutterstock;Online seller of everything;Amazon.com;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) has been making America great for nearly 23 years. The brainchild of CEO Jeff Bezos began life as a hub where avid readers could get the latest novels, and discover both new and old works that would appeal to their tastes.;That formula worked not only for literature, but for everything from music, film, video games, electronics, clothing, toys, toothpaste … and just about anything else one can require or desire.;Amazon.com's relatively recent foray into the cloud computing business has been an unequivocal success, with the company raking in some $3.2 billion in cloud computing revenue in the third quarter of 2016.;3 Fast-Food Stocks That Are Sweating Bullets Thanks to McDonald's;That figure was up 55% from the same quarter the year prior. Amazon's web services business proves that not only does the company make America great by delivering the products we want right to our door, it also makes possible many of the e-commerce sites the American - and global - economy relies on to function smoothly.;Stocks to Buy:;Apple (AAPL);Source:;Yuanbin Du Via Flickr;Personal technology giant;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is not only one of the most profitable companies in history, it's also;the most admired;. And why shouldn't it be?;"The ubiquity, efficacy, ease of operation, quality, sophisticated industrial design and just outright aesthetic beauty of the company's products is a feat of entrepreneurial genius that on its own can be cited as a ""drop-the-mic"" reason why America already deserves the greatness title.";The company's iconic products - the Mac, iPod, iPad and iPhone - all have transformed the way not only Americans live, but also the way most of the developed and developing nations live. AAPL stock ran into a slowdown for much of 2016, but since Election Day, Wall Street has made Apple shares great again, with a surge of more than 10%.;Investors are clearly betting on the continued upside likely to come with the release of the company's 10th-anniversary iPhone. If you want proof America is already great, just check your iMessages.;Stocks to Buy:;Facebook (FB);Source: Shutterstock;Social media pioneer;Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;) is a relatively recent entry into the ranks of companies making America great, and it's done so by the sheer disruptive power of its product.;The creation of CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the kind of game-changing invention that comes along infrequently, but when it does it's hard to see how we ever got along without it.;"From connecting with old friends to staying in contact with relatives; and from discovering new interests, nurturing hobbies and networking with others who share similar worldviews, Facebook has become an essential part of the American (and global) experience.";"Ironically, Facebook's flap with ""fake news"" and its ranking of certain news stories was an issue in the presidential campaign. Yet Facebook also was cited by President Trump as a key to his victory, as he told CBS'";60 Minutes;that the;power of his following on the social media giant;helped him win key races where he was outspent by his opponent.;The 3 Best Sector ETFs to Buy for a Profitable 2017;So, Facebook not only already makes America great, it also made President Trump's campaign a winner.;Stocks to Buy:;Goldman Sachs (GS);Source:;Erik Drost;"If you were asked to compile a list of the ""Big Banks"" that have financed America's growth, as well as her ascension to greatness, it's hard not to start with";Goldman Sachs Group Inc;(NYSE:;GS;).;The premier investment bank has been at the center of the financial world since the reparative, post-Civil War years, when it helped finance America's rebirth beginning in 1869.;Since then the company has had a storied history of providing the capital, as well as the financial framework, that's nurtured the rise of the greatest capitalist experiment in history.;In another example of;Trumpian;irony, the president criticized the banks - and specifically Goldman Sachs - for transgressions that caused the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. Yet who did Trump turn to for key positions in his campaign and in his cabinet? You guessed it,;numerous Goldman Sachs alumni;.;The moral of the story here is that when you want your own administration to be great, you turn to those who have done great things at one of the greatest American financial institutions.;Stocks to Buy:;Alphabet (GOOGL);Source: Shutterstock;Perhaps the only thing not great about;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;), better known as Google, is its ghastly choice of new moniker. Yet despite its ill-fitting name, Alphabet's core product - the Google search engine - has already made information-seeking America great.;Founded by then-Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were at Stanford University, the tech entrepreneurs leveraged the PC and internet explosion and created the go-to source for information on just about anything imaginable.;Its corporate mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, has long been accomplished. And though Google has only been in existence for less than 20 years, like Facebook, it also has become an essential part of the American and the international experience.;10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains;Just try to go more than a few days without using Google. It's nearly impossible, especially if you are someone who loves knowing things.;Stocks to Buy:;Disney (DIS);Source: Shutterstock;Anyone who has grown up in America since the 1940s, or who has reared children or grandchildren over the past five decades, knows all-too-well the draw that is the;Walt Disney Co;(NYSE:;DIS;).;Purveyors of iconic American characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White and so many others, the company has built a media and entertainment empire by knowing what Americans (and the world) want to see.;Disney's relatively recent acquisition of the Star Wars franchise is proof of the company's commitment to remaining the leader in providing entertainment with the broadest appeal.;Founded on the genius of Walt Disney the man, the Disney Company was set up to be a dream factory capable of igniting children's imaginations all over the world. It's safe to say that it has done just that, and that it will remain great long after President Trump has completed his tenure in the Oval Office.;Stocks to Buy:;American Express (AXP);Source:;Marcus Quigmire Via Flickr;"When ""American"" is part of your name, it's easy to make the short hop of logic needed to proclaim";American Express Company;(NYSE:;AXP;) a company that's already making America great. Indeed, the credit card issuer, and;Dow Jones;component, offers what is arguably the best customer service in the financial services industry.;Moreover, it's an aspirational brand that pulls at the capitalist heart strings of nearly every American set on achieving financial prowess. For those who've experienced it, how can you forget being approved for your first American Express card? That grant signifies an arrival of sorts into an honored clubhouse of the financially fit.;Here, too, irony and the Trump administration once again collide. If President Trump and the Republican Congress can get personal tax reform passed, American Express shares may be the biggest beneficiary. The reason why is because higher income and higher net worth consumers tend to use American Express more than rival credit cards.;3 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy for Income and Growth;As such, a reduction in marginal tax rates for the nation's top earners would likely translate into increased spending via AmEx - which would funnel down directly to AXP shares.;Stocks to Buy:;Caterpillar (CAT);Source:;Anthony via Flickr;The makers of earth-shaping equipment have literally transformed the American landscape into man's image, a feat that on its own qualifies;Caterpillar Inc.;(NYSE:;CAT;) for a spot on the 10 stocks that already make America great.;The unmistakable CAT brand is responsible for helping more builders erect more homes, shopping centers, office buildings, roads, bridges and dams than any government infrastructure project could ever do.;In fact, any effort to make America's infrastructure great again would likely start with a whole lot of equipment from Caterpillar, as its heavy machinery is an integral part of massive build outs here at home, and worldwide.;The CAT brand also is seen as a sort of badge of honor in the developing world, as developing nations seek to build their infrastructure in the image of the American landscape. To the rest of the world, America is already great … and they often use Caterpillar equipment to help their own nations look like us.;Stocks to Buy:;Tesla Motors (TSLA);Source: Shutterstock;America is a car culture country, and many of her most iconic brands -;General Motors Company;(NYSE:;GM;) and;Ford Motor Company;(NYSE:;F;) - represent the best of American industrial prowess.;While these storied brands could themselves be on any list of stocks that already make America great, one new car company embodies all of the entrepreneurial and innovative genius that's at the heart of what makes America special. That company is;Tesla Motors Inc;(NASDAQ:;TSLA;).;"The brainchild of the ceaselessly creative Elon Musk, Tesla has proven that luxury, performance and the lack of an internal combustion engine can be a splendid marriage; one never lacking in operator excitement.

The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This Quarter;January 27, 2017, 02:59:00 PM EDT;Analysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.;Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.;Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.;But technology companies are fighting it out. Microsoft;MSFT;for one has strongly resisted government demands as have Apple;AAPL;and Amazon;AMZN;. Alphabet's;GOOGL;Google has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.;Other players with similar interests are chip makers like Intel;INTC;, NVIDIA;NVDA;, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices;AMD;"; networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.";Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:;Intel;Intel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.;Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.;Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.;Microsoft;Microsoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.;The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.;Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.;Alphabet;Alphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.;Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.;"CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.";Now See Our Private Investment Ideas;While the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Has Quite a Wall to Climb;January 27, 2017, 11:48:32 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Whenever high-flying stocks get their wings clipped, they are never the same on the markets.;Fitbit Inc;(NYSE:;FIT;) ended its recovery of the summer of 2016 when it warned on Nov. 2, 2016, that fourth-quarter estimates would miss estimates. Bears are all over the stock: short float stands at 43.5%. And when the company reports results in February, bulls still hope the company's wearables devices sold like hot cakes.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Via Fitbit;Expectations Lowered for FIT Stock;In its third-quarter report, the company cut the current quarter's estimates;sharply;:;"""The company expects revenue between $725 million and $750 million, representing growth of 2%-5%, with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.14 to $0.18, and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 33%.""";At a full-year earnings per share of between 55 cents and 59 cents, FIT trades at a forward P/E of up to 13.5 times (Based on Thursday's closing price of $7.41). Investors clearly have low expectations for the company. Trailing quarterly sales grew by 23.1%. Shorts are winning the bearish bet because they understand a company with good products is not necessarily a good stock.;Competition Heating Up;Despite a record low valuation, low expectations for the quarter and potential growth in Europe and Asia, FIT stock has one big problem: competition.

Executing on this requires good management. When management said it mishandled the Flex 2 supply chain, few investors should have any confidence on management.;On Jan. 12, news broke out that Fitbit may have;wanted;to acquire;Jawbone;late last year.

Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29;January 27, 2017, 11:30:57 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;With the official Galaxy Note 7 battery review out of the way, everyone has been waiting for;Samsung Electronics Co Ltd;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) to release the new Galaxy S8. Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. Now;VentureBeat;says it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.;"makeArticleAd();";Source: Samsung;Samsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.;First, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. That;event took place last week;.;Galaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery Concerns;As part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.;As a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.;7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018;The Guardian;, citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to a;late March release date;. Yesterday,;VentureBeat's;Evan Blass;claimed to have specifics;, saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.;Galaxy S8 Details;The;VentureBeat;report also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.;"As has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved ""Edge"" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.";The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlike;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.;By connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, the;advanced AI personal assistant;Samsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.;Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL);Interestingly,;VentureBeat;says the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be €100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.;The Importance of the Galaxy S8 Launch;It can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders.;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.;Both rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.;In the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare had;dropped 13.5%;compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.;As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;3 Things Apple Inc.

Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?;January 27, 2017, 11:26:42 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Patent wars are harmful to corporations and other growing things.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;iphonedigital via Flickr;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) has now gone to patent war with;Qualcomm, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;QCOM;), knocking 13% off the modem chip maker's market cap in less than a week.;The war;has now extended to China;, where two Apple suits are seeking $145 million in damages (about 1 billion Yuan) over how Qualcomm licenses patents there.;This being early in the war, the response of Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf is;"""bring it on.""";But, he hasn't seen the legal bills, yet. Shareholders, however, seem to have a clue about what they might be, and apparently feel they will be huge.;Apple has yet to be hurt by any of this. AAPL stock price is up about 1.7% since the court papers were filed. But, the march to its record high of $132.54 per share, achieved in May 2015, may now be disrupted.;3 Grossly Overpriced Tech Stocks That Could Collapse;What the War Is About;Qualcomm controls standards essential patents (SEPs), including those for the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system used by carriers such as;Verizon Communications Inc.;(NYSE:;VZ;). This means that every CDMA phone chip maker, and CDMA base station maker, is paying license fees to Qualcomm for using those patents. Apple began doing so in 2011;when it opened the iPhone to Verizon's network.;Qualcomm used its CDMA patents to become the sole supplier of modem chips for the iPhone. It liked this position and refused to join industry-wide agreements covering Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) access to its patents, giving QCOM the power to constrict Apple's supply of modem chips.;Apple eventually found;another supplier for the chips;,;Intel Corporation;(NASDAQ:;INTC;), while still paying license fees to Qualcomm.;Qualcomm, meanwhile,;won an expensive fight with China over its patent rights;, and is fighting with South Korea after getting;Samsung Electronics;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) to back down and use Qualcomm gear in its phones.;The short version is that Qualcomm uses its patents to control the global phone market and Apple doesn't like that.;The Risk to Apple;While the market has discounted the risks in these fights to Qualcomm, it has not considered the potential impact on Apple. Credit the $642 billion market cap of Apple, against Qualcomm's $76 billion.;There is also a whisper number on Apple earnings, due out January 31, of;$77.04 billion in revenue and profit of $3.23 per share;. Combine that with over $200 billion in cash and the market may be anticipating a raise in the Apple dividend, currently 57 cents per share. AAPL stock price is still floating on Christmas.;But, the risks in a patent war are real. Intel had to turn itself inside-out to make those iPhone modem chips. Another generation of phones and networks is coming, and Qualcomm will have patents to fight with there, too.;Apple has already suffered, the company claimed in court, losing a $1 billion rebate it says Qualcomm owed it after AAPL helped;a South Korean investigation;into Qualcomm's business practices, one that resulted in South Korea imposing;$864 million in fines.;So far, Qualcomm has won in China and it has won against Samsung, and Apple's legal arguments don't scare it. If Korea can get Qualcomm to pay the fine, Samsung may feel emboldened, but SSNLF is;in disarray;and may not be in a position to fight Qualcomm any time soon. Apple has taken up its sword.;Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steals AI Expert Back From Apple Inc. (AAPL);Given Apple's market size, the cost of lawyers to fight Qualcomm business practices may appear to be a rounding error, but this is going to be a nasty and costly fight. Apple's autonomy in its supply decisions is at stake, as is Qualcomm's control over the market.;The market has yet to discount Apple stock over the costs of this war, but I suspect that will happen soon.

Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants In;January 27, 2017, 10:10:22 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;It's an awkward topic for rogue, extreme-right wing elements in our country. Heck,;I'm;not even sure how I really feel about it. But there's a point where it's no longer useful to continuously ignore the giant pink elephant in the room. So here goes it - Asia will take over the world. There's not a darn thing anyone can do to stop the train. And;Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;) will have it no other way.;"makeArticleAd();";Source: Shutterstock;In fact, Facebook is probably one of the few companies that recognize this demographic reality. Subsequently, FB stock is a very real challenger to the near-hegemonic dominance of;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;).;Honestly, the social media network is well on its way to becoming what;Apple Inc;. (NASDAQ:;AAPL;) once was before copycat competitors entered the fray: a completely unique experience and solution with no natural predators.;"Interestingly, much of society is turning their back towards the demographic goldmine that Facebook stock is sitting on. The NFL celebrates """;Hispanic Heritage Month;","" and Mexico City";hosted;"a regular-season game last year. After activists blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, the film industry made dramatic changes. According to NBC News, the ""'African-American Film Critics Association declared 2016 the best year for";blacks in cinema;"'ever'.""";While these are profound steps towards diversity and inclusion, there's a glaring omission. According to researchers at the;University of Southern California;", ""'at least half or more of all cinematic, television, or streaming stories"" didn't portray a single Asian or Asian-American on screen.'""";"This ""yellow-out"" may be swept under the rug now, but mark my words, FB stock will change everything.";Asian Markets Too Bigly for FB Stock to Ignore;"As InvestorPlace contributor Craig Adeyanju notes, the Facebook stock price is all about the numbers, and the numbers look amazing! Adeyanju writes that with ""Facebook on course to reach 2 billion users this year without China, the opportunities become bigger once China allows FB in its country again. Keep in mind that China currently has the";largest number;"of internet users globally.""";7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018;He is so right - the number of China's;internet users;exceed that of the U.S. by a more than 150% margin. Those are bigly consumers that FB stock desperately wants to tap into. But they're not;that;desperate. China is often overused as a justification for buying Facebook stock or any number of investments. However, just scale up the picture a bit and you'll see why Mark Zuckerberg is so excited.;The;majority;"of Earth's human population is Asian, period. Even if you were to open a ""heritage month"" for every race, color and creed in America, you would at most affect less than 5% of the world. Adding in the entire Latin American population would help, but the leverage would be less than Africa, and slightly more than Europe.";An investment in Facebook stock is simply a recognition of a changing world. Unfortunately, few have this ability. For example,;Princeton University;detailed evidence of;discrimination in academia;"designed to ""cull"" Asian student populations. In contrast, from the perspective of FB stock, these demographic trends are to be embraced, celebrated and ultimately, profited.";Untapped Riches Still Available for Facebook Stock;I mentioned before that China is an overused argument. But when you drill deeper into the statistics, there's still a lot of gold for FB stock to mine. The perennial Asian powerhouse's internet penetration is just slightly above half the population. In contrast, the U.S. internet penetration is nearly 89%. That's the raw, low-hanging fruit from which Facebook stock can benefit.;3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep Delivering in 2017;But even in a place like Japan, where the internet penetration is more than 91%, there's still a viable opportunity for FB. As of the midway point of last year, there were;26 million Japanese;Facebook subscribers. That's less than a 21% penetration rate for the company. Japan is actually an unheralded market: it has an incredibly educated, tech savvy population.;In many ways, that's a better prospect for FB stock rather than activating developing or frontier markets because of the existing infrastructure.;Click to Enlarge;But the really exciting potential is that when developing countries reach the next stage, FB can spark a global revolution. Asia's total Facebook penetration rate is less than 14% - just marginally better than Africa. That means that the company's future is in Asian hands.;The North American market is near realistic capacity at 62%, while Latin America is not that far behind at 52%. Given the enormous economic growth in Asia, that's not a bad gig for FB stock.;While the rest of the world is focused on the transition of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Facebook has been looking at a trend decades in the making. Indeed, the movement is inevitable and will have far-reaching consequences well outside our lifetimes. They only thing any company can do is to prepare for it, and FB has a substantial lead.;As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains;"10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017";The post;Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants In;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.

Videogame Stock Roundup: Microsoft Reports Q2 Earnings, Nintendo Launches Pokemon Go in South Korea;January 27, 2017, 09:16:00 AM EDT;Among the top stories this week, Microsoft Corp.;MSFT;reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In a separate development, after almost a six-month delay, South Korean gamers can now enjoy Pokémon Go as Nintendo;NTDOY;launched the game officially in the country.;Meanwhile, Facebook Inc;FB;zeroed in on Hugo Barra, an ex-Xiaomi executive to spearhead its VR initiatives.;Recap of the Developments;1. Microsoft's second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 83 cents and revenues $26.07 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though gaming is a very small part of the company's business, Xbox is an important aspect of the overall video game industry. Microsoft's gaming revenues fell 3% (1% in constant currency). Xbox Live monthly active users were up 17% to 55 million. The company witnessed more than 26 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets.;The company's shares have surged 26% compared with the Zacks;Computer-Software;industry's gain of 24.31% in the last one year.;At present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see;the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here;.;2. After a six-month delay, Nintendo has now officially;launched;its blockbuster hit game, Pokémon Go in South Korea, on both Alphabet's;GOOGL;Play Store and Apple Inc.'s;AAPL;"iOS store. Per media reports, Nintendo's Pokémon Go works with Google Maps, which has ""limited access"" in South Korea. Niantic had earlier sought permission from the South Korean government for access to Korean maps, which was flatly refused. Google had not agreed to South Korean government's demand to ""blur"" sensitive locations like government buildings on Maps.";Reportedly, the denial stemmed from the fact that South Korea remains concerned about its national security. It doesn't share warm ties with its neighbor, North Korea. The simmering border tension between the two nations has led the South Korean government to disallow storage of detailed maps of the country on any other servers except those in South Korea, add media reports.;It remains unknown how Niantic, the firm which developed Pokémon Go, bypassed the Maps issue, add media reports. Niantic chose to remain silent on this issue during the press conference it held in Seoul on Jan 23, 2017.;Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The success of Pokémon Go helped the company's share price. Over the past one year, its shares are up 55.86% compared with Zacks;Toys/Games/ Hobby/Products;industry's gain of 18.42%.;"3. Meanwhile, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg in a post announced that ex-Xiaomi vice president, Hugo Barra will spearhead all the company's VR initiatives as well as the Oculus unit. Zuckerberg further added ""Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team.""";Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel its ambitious AR/VR efforts. Zuckerberg has time and again mentioned that VR is the next big business opportunity. Facebook has been pumping ample resources to boost its VR efforts. A few days back, Zuckerberg said that Facebook was going to spend over $3 billion over the next 10 years.;However, Oculus has been;slapped;"with a $2 billion lawsuit filed by video game company, ZeniMax. Zuckerberg appeared in a Dallas courtroom to testify against the allegations. Apparently, Zuckerberg has denied all allegations and stressed that ""The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone else's is just wrong.""";At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #2.  In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 39.92%, compared with the Zacks;Internet Services;industry's gain of 19.39%.;Performance;The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:;Company;Last 5 Days;Last 6 Months;ATVI;1.34%;-5.03%;EA;1.68%;6.32%;GLUU;6.98%;-3.77%;MSFT;2.50%;13.23%;NTES;6.00%;23.20%;TTWO;4.15%;33.77%;ZNGA;-2.65%;-10.76%;Over the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile Inc;GLUU;was up 6.98% whereas Zynga Inc;ZNGA;was down 2.65%.;Over the last six-month period, Take Two Interactive;TTWO;surged the most (33.77%). The company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like GrandTheft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (though sales are slowing down), along with its other releases like NBA 2K17. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company's margins. The company continues to expect growth in digital revenues driven by higher sale of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.;Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return;Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return;Zynga was down 10.76% over the same time frame. Slowdown in its user growth remains a major concern. Moreover, a slowing web business along with intensifying competition are added concerns. However, its cost cutting initiatives are a positive.

How Intel Corporation Can Strengthen Its Relationship With Apple Inc.;January 27, 2017, 08:21:00 AM EDT;With the;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giant;Intel;(NASDAQ: INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant   portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets   -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has   ever enjoyed.;Image source: Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found   inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that   don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rival;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA   networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA.;Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets   from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to   allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety   of Apple's cellular modem needs.;"Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to   what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against   Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that ""Qualcomm has charged   Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are   in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without   CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly   power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and   chipset supply terms,"" the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read.";I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and   today there is an observation I would like to share regarding   Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones.;Apple's component costs could come down if Intel     succeeds in implementing CDMA;"Based on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges   Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled   compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual   practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel   routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain   features enabled, compared with variants without those features   enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work.";Image source: Qualcomm.;"What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because   Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its   CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a ""monopolistic premium.""";The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that   Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the   opportunity for Intel.;If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also   supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA   networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open   the door to a couple of possibilities:;"Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It     could be a true ""second source"" for all the iPhones that Apple     ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to     Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment).";Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from     Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of     total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel     and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could     help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular     modem.;Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider   would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems.   This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and,   ultimately, net profit.;"To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says   that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that   Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20   for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7,   Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips;   the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel.";If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence   of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across   potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year.   That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no   clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes   that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are   significant.;Intel needs to execute;The key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building   increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then   that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell   more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper   modems.;The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume --   whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the   very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale   of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate.;In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip   business probably isn't going to sting Qualcomm;that;much.

Should You Sell Qualcomm After Apple's $1 Billion Lawsuit?;January 26, 2017, 08:52:00 PM EDT;Shares of;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was   sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The lawsuit is related to the FTC's   separate;lawsuit against Qualcomm;, which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of   critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out   of the market. Let's take a closer look at this tangled   mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their   shares.;Image source: Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";Why is Apple suing Qualcomm?;Back in 2008,;Sprint;deployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn't   heavily dependent on Qualcomm's patent portfolio.;Intel;(NASDAQ: INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but   Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard --   which it could generate more licensing fees from.;"At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax   networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions,   Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple ""rebates"" for sticking with its   baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those   rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things --";exclusively;using Qualcomm's chips (from 2011 to 2016), and not;instigating;"any litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair   licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially   ""bribed"" Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to   competing chipsets.";Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust   probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair   licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975   million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could   face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and   Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with   authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments -- which   it's now suing to recover.;The outcome is anyone's guess...;"The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty   one, since it's dependent on many shifting variables. First, the   FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K.   Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that   was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump   Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is   dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement;   but if it isn't, the rebates could be invalidated as ""bribes"" --   which may hurt both companies.";"Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple   needs to prove that it didn't violate the two main conditions of   its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean   FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn't deny aiding the KFTC   at all -- it recently told CNN that it was merely   ""responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies"" instead of   ""instigating"" litigation against Qualcomm.";Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing   practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device's   entire value, instead of just the chips in the device -- a   practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also   charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don't use any of   its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless   technologies -- although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm's   licensed patents don't actually cover those core technologies.   This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using   Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past),   and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of   rebates.;Understanding the risks to Qualcomm;If Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other   regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing   model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business'   margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business   generates the lion's share of its profits.;It could also jeopardize Qualcomm's;planned acquisition;of;NXP Semiconductors;(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automotive   chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If   Qualcomm doesn't close that deal this year, its top line will   remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone   market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing   business.;But should you sell Qualcomm?;Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that   the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock   down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times   earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays   a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout   ratio of 53%.;As a Qualcomm shareholder, I'm certainly disappointed with   recent developments. But I don't plan to sell my shares unless   the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to   dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I'll still   consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with   solid growth prospects in;adjacent markets;like connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm's Earnings Call Dominated By Apple Lawsuit;January 26, 2017, 05:49:00 PM EDT;CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Image source: Qualcomm.;Mobile chip giant;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) reported fiscal first-quarter results last night.   While the results as well as guidance mostly topped analyst   expectations,;Apple;"'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) recent lawsuit against the company expectedly   dominated the subsequent earnings call (""Apple"" was mentioned 74   times). For good reason, too, since Apple is widely considered   Qualcomm's largest customer, combined with the fact that the   lawsuit threatens Qualcomm's licensing model.";"makeArticleAd();";Beyond a few brief statements, this is the first time that   Qualcomm has commented publicly and in granular detail regarding   the suit. Here's what management had to say.;Prepared remarks;"CEO Steve Mollenkopf first noted that the two companies have   historically had a strong relationship, and Qualcomm intends to   ""remain a good supplier"" despite the legal complaint. The company   would naturally have preferred to settle its dispute with Apple   in private negotiations instead of litigation, but it remains   confident that it can defend itself in court. Mollenkopf summed   it up: ""Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in   the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of   intellectual property. They want to pay less for the fair value   that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our   technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits   from using that technology.""";President Derek Aberle continued:;Touching briefly on Apple's complaints filed in San Diego     and China, it claims that Qualcomm should be required to     license its cellular standard essential patents, or SEPs, to     modem suppliers. That even when licensing those patents at the     device level, Qualcomm should only be able to charge royalties     on the price of the cellular modem chip inside the device.;These positions, however, are inconsistent with     long-standing industry practice, the [intellectual property     rights] policies of the relevant standard-setting bodies, the     realities of licensing large portfolios of patents, and basic     notions of efficiency, fairness in economics.;Aberle points out that device-level licensing is utilized   throughout the industry by many major patent holders beyond   Qualcomm. (Apple is seeking chip-level licensing.) Qualcomm says   its patents also contribute to many other features in modern   smartphones beyond cellular connectivity, further justifying   device-level royalties. Shifting to chip-level royalties would   then introduce different layers of licensing for all the various   chips that Qualcomm enables or sells itself, so it licenses the   entire portfolio for the sake of efficiency.;"Apple says that there is no limit to the royalty rates, which   is why it seeks per-unit royalty relief in the form of ""rebate""   payments. Aberle says this is untrue:";In addition, it is well known that Qualcomm has per-unit     running royalty caps as part of its licensing program. This     effectively results in licensees not paying running royalties     as a percentage of the device price above a certain net selling     price of any given device. Apple's claim that royalties are     uncapped is simply incorrect.;Aberle also reiterated that Qualcomm believes Apple is   instigating these regulatory attacks as well as providing   inaccurate information:;Apple claims that Qualcomm retaliated because Apple     cooperated with government investigations. To be clear, we did     no such thing. We simply objected to Apple making false and     misleading statements and withholding information to motivate     attacks against Qualcomm. We welcome the opportunity to have     Apple's claims heard in court, where we will be entitled to     full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of     the merits. We will prove that Apple's irresponsible claims of     extortion are false.;"There should be no immediate impact to sales from the lawsuit,   either. Apple still needs modems, and Qualcomm will still supply   them. CFO George Davis said, ""We are not forecasting any impact   to revenues related to the dispute with Apple, as we are   continuing to meet their supply needs in good faith and expect   Apple will continue to meet its obligations.""";Questions and answers;As usual, the analyst Q&A often provides more color.   Qualcomm affirmed that Apple does not have a direct license, but   rather an indirect license through its contract manufacturers.   Qualcomm isn't worried about collecting, said Aberle:;Apple does not have a direct license with Qualcomm today.     And so the royalties on Apple products that get paid to     Qualcomm are reported and paid by their contract manufacturers.     So although we do have a dispute now with Apple and they are     challenging some of the offers and some of our licensing terms,     the contracts that we have in place with their suppliers remain     valid and enforceable. And we would expect that our licensees     will continue to comply with the terms of their agreements. And     we would also hope and expect that Apple would not interfere     with the terms of those agreements. But of course, we can't     fully control those actions.;When asked about the exclusivity and monopoly power   allegations, general counsel Don Rosenberg (who incidentally used   to work for Apple a decade ago), downplayed the idea that   Qualcomm wields monopoly power:;With regard to your question about so-called exclusivity     deal, first of all, we -- I think you called this monopoly     power or had monopoly power. We don't believe we have monopoly     power in the chip market or any other market. And nor do we     have an exclusivity arrangement. We have never prevented Apple     or anybody else from buying from competitive chipmakers. And in     the Apple case, it's pretty clear since, as you know, they have     been buying from;Intel;fairly recently. So it's a mischaracterization to call it an     exclusive dealing arrangement.;This is a little murky, since Apple;had;been exclusively buying basebands from Qualcomm for five years,   and only started buying from Intel after the alleged exclusivity   ended.;Overall, Qualcomm thinks Apple is simply trying to finagle   lower payments -- lower being beneath fair value as established   by its hundreds of other licensing deals with many companies over   the years. That risks somewhat oversimplifying Apple's complaint,   because Apple is also accusing Qualcomm of various forms of   anticompetitive behavior. Whether or not those allegations stand   up in court remains to be seen.;10 stocks we like better than Qualcomm;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

By comparison,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is up nearly 25% in the last year while;Nokia Corp (ADR);(NYSE:;NOK;), which exited the Windows Phone market and focused on networking, fell 33%.;Still, the DTEK70 release is important for BBRY.;BlackBerry and TCL Partnership;BlackBerry outsourced its entire hardware development and manufacturing with;TCL;". Early signs are positive that ""Mercury"" will win customers, especially in the business space. BlackBerry said that it is 100% in";developing;"software solutions. TCL's ""Mercury"" build offers a secure Android operating system and has a physical keyboard. The company earns IP and royalty revenue for each device TCL sells.";On its conference call in December, BlackBerry;described;the TCL deal:;"This licensing model allows BlackBerry to generate ongoing high margin royalty revenue from a device software based on the number of units sold. We have a pipeline of additional opportunities that are focusing on, including a late discussion in India that are ongoing.""";Decent Price to Performance;BlackBerry priced the budget DTEK50 in the right range but did not win the mainstream market. DTEK60 demonstrated the company's ability to make a solid, high-performance phone at mainstream prices. DTEK70 is even more practical for business users.;Rumored;to run on a;Qualcomm, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;QCOM;) Snapdragon 635 or Snapdragon 821, the device will have just 4.5 inches of screen real estate.;5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in February;This is the magic number for DTEK70: The device may sell for around just $350. At that price and size, business users who crave for higher productivity will snap up this phone when it is launched.;Profit Margin;BlackBerry CEO John Chen will not allow the company to sell devices at a loss. Assume profit margins in the range of 25%-50% for TCL. When the costs of software development are included, the profit margin for BBRY may run above 50%-60%.;Launch Date;On its blog, BlackBerry said it will give more details about the smartphone at the Mobile World Congress show. The event runs from Feb. 27 to March 3.;"Interest in ""Mercury""+ ""BlackBerry"" jumped:";Click to Enlarge;Source:;tickertags.com;Game Changer or More of the Same?;Past BlackBerry Android devices did not give the company much revenue growth. In the third quarter, the $172 million in software services revenue accounted for 57% of the company's revenue.;The TCL licensing deal, though, is a game-changer for the software company. DTEK70's development costs are all shouldered by its partner. BlackBerry gets a cut in the sales through the software licensing. High profit margins from software sales will translate to more profits for the company.;The one big catch is that BBRY and TCL must advertise and promote this upcoming device.

Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;January 26, 2017, 12:27:55 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;If you bought and held stock in;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) at the height of the dot-com run, it's been an unpleasant 16 years. However, after a long wait, MSFT stock finally reached a new all-time high last month. Despite the tech world changing drastically in the ensuing years, Microsoft's PC dominance lives on, minting money for the company.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Mike Mozart Via Flickr;"The company's various new efforts over the years have mostly been flops. There's a reason Microsoft stock has performed poorly; efforts such as Windows phones simply haven't panned out. However, it seems Microsoft has finally turned the corner.";It is making real headway in several promising areas, including its cloud offering. And investors have cheered, sending Microsoft's stock up sharply since 2013. Can the good times continue, or will buyers up at these levels be in for another long decade?;MSFT Stock Cons;Huge Stock Run-Up;: Since 2013, MSFT stock has more than doubled. At first glance, that seems fine, the market has performed strongly in recent years after all. However, Microsoft is so large, that it becomes hard to achieve further such doublings. With a market cap just under $500 billion today, even one more double takes Microsoft to a trillion dollar market cap. It's worth asking what the company has going from a growth perspective that could justify such a lofty figure.;Sure, the company has some growth initiatives under way. The cloud offering is going well. And the LinkedIn acquisition may start to bear more fruit. But after watching the stock run from under 30 in recent years to over 60 today, you have to ask how much more upside really makes sense, particularly since the company has had near non-existent revenue growth lately.;10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains;High Valuation:;First things first, MSFT stock isn't really trading at a 30 price-earnings ratio. I know that's what financial websites report. However, that's based on GAAP figures that include one-off losses related to restructuring. On an adjusted basis, Microsoft is trading in the mid-20s, and at 21 times forward earnings. However, even that doesn't paint a flattering picture for the company. Microsoft traded at 12 times earnings or less over much of the past decade. Is Microsoft worth paying twice as much for now?;Sure, the PC market has stabilized, but it isn't likely to ever be a meaningful growth driver again. And the newer initiatives such as cloud seem likely to take years to reach strong profitability. At 21 times forward earnings, MSFT stock is pricing in some serious growth prospects that may well not materialize.;Questionable Deal-Making:;Microsoft has a reputation for making some head-scratching M&A moves. The less said of the aQuantive purchase and the Nokia buy, the better. Those two alone resulted in almost $14 billion of write-offs. And the recent LinkedIn deal raises questions. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn, and offered a massive premium to where shares where trading previously. At the price Microsoft paid, it offered around 30x free cash flow for LinkedIn. On an earnings basis, LinkedIn was still losing money.;Sure, Microsoft can cut some costs there, particularly for stock-based compensation, but it's still a massive price tag. And with Microsoft having such a huge war chest on its balance sheet, the temptation will surely be there for the company to make other huge value-destructive deals.;MSFT Stock Pros;PC Market Stabilizing:;For quite a few years now, the traditional PC market appeared to be in serious decline. Sales peaked in 2011, with;364 million units;sold that year globally. Since then, sales have plunged. By 2015, sales dropped 24% from that peak year, falling to just 275 million units. And 2016 showed another solid decline, with sales reaching just 260 million units. However, the worst may now have passed. 2020 projections are for 250 million units sold, only a fractional decline from current levels.;And the;most recent data;supports this further moderation: sales slipped just 1.5% versus the same period last year. And in several areas globally, including Canada and Japan, PC sales are actually increasing again. One possible reason, the rate of forward technological progress has slowed for both tablets and smartphones, reducing pressure on consumers to switch to smaller screens. A stable market would be great news for MSFT stock.;Partnership With Qualcomm:;Microsoft has partnered with;Qualcomm, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;QCOM;) for their Internet of Things efforts. Qualcomm has entered conflict with;Intel Corporation;(NASDAQ:;INTC;) at first over the IoT market. In the longer-run, Qualcomm may use its chips to even forcefully attack Intel's long-held dominance in the PC market. In any case, Microsoft benefits nicely from partnering up with Qualcomm.;The IoT offerings born from this venture will help spread Windows 10 outside of just the traditional PC market. And given the shellacking that QCOM stock took earlier this week following;Apple Inc.'s;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) lawsuit against the firm, Qualcomm has reason to deepen ties with friendly partners. As an industry outcast, Qualcomm needs whatever help it can get, and if Microsoft can use that to expand Windows as a broader OS, all the better.;Solid Dividend Option:;Microsoft has quietly turned into a nice yield choice for more conservative investors. The company has tripled its dividend since 2008. In total, it's posted 16%, 18% and 16% dividend growth rates over the past three, five and ten years. While the payout ratio currently looks a little high, that's based on abnormally soft recent earnings. Make no mistake, there is plenty of room left here for more dividend increases. The company has an astounding $137 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Even after subtracting out debt, the company has a net cash position of $62 billion, leaving plenty of firepower for increased dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions.;Verdict;MSFT stock is a decent selection if you're purely concerned with its yield and safety. The company's main PC business is looking healthier than it has in quite awhile. The balance sheet is tremendous. The dividend is significant at today's level, and is bound to keep rising quickly.;Here's Why Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock Is the Best Play in Oil;However, there's little to recommend Microsoft on valuation. The stock is expensive, even when you look closely. Microsoft has plenty of growth initiatives in the works, but actual operating results recently have only been so-so. When buying stocks at all-time highs, you want to see a business with more operating momentum.;At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held INTC and QCOM stock. He had no position in Microsoft.

(;AAPL;);"announced its iOS 10.3 update with a special feature, apparently called ""Find my Airpods"", that will help to track misplaced Airpods.";Powered by a new W1 chip, the Airpods are in line with Apple's vision of wireless future. Apparently, its best feature seems to be the use of sensors to detect if the plugs have been inserted in both the ears. However, since its launch, Airpod has been a hot topic of discussion on Facebook;FB;and Twitter;TWTR;given the chances of it being misplaced easily due to its size.;Per media reports, Apple's announcement can be seen as an answer to users' request to make a feature that will help them find these small AirPods. Due to its small size, the Airpod cannot accommodate a built-in GPS system. Therefore, the latest feature is tailored to locate misplaced Airpods that are within the Bluetooth range of an iPhone or iPad.;Then again, the problem remains that the exact location of the Airpod cannot be determined with the feature and only the last connected location will show up on the connected iOS device, add further media reports. Additionally, the feature is capable of activating a sound from the Airpod to indicate its location. However, these features are useless once the Airpod's battery is exhausted.;Apple Inc. Price and Consensus;Apple Inc. Price and Consensus;|;Apple Inc. Quote;Apple's fortunes have been tied to its most important offering, the iPhone, which alone contributed about 60% of its total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.;However, since the last two quarters, the demand for this device has been soft owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially due to currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe (about 60% of Apple revenues come from International markets).;The Airpod had been one of the key attractions of the iPhone 7 series. Reportedly, since the launch of Airpods in December, Apple has been on the top of the headphone market that boasts names likes Sony;SNE;, Bose, JBL and others. Although Apple has refrained from posting its official sales figures, the market reports indicate positive impact of Airpod sales on first quarter results.;In the past one year, Apple's shares are up 19.98%, compared with the Zacks;Computer Mini;industry's increase of 21.41%, as of Jan 24.;Zacks' Best Private Investment Ideas;In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?;Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;January 26, 2017, 09:30:00 AM EDT;For Immediate Release;Chicago, IL - January 26, 2017-;Zacks Equity Research;highlights;Broadcom (;NASDAQ:;AVGO;-;Free Report;);as the Bull of the Day and;Valeant Pharmaceuticals (;NYSE:;VRX;-;Free Report;);as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on;Apple (;NASDAQ:;AAPL;-;Free Report;),;Amazon;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;-;Free Report;) and;Netflix;(NASDAQ:;NFLX;-;Free Report;);.;Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:;Bull of the Day;:;Seems it was only a month ago I writing about;Broadcom (;NASDAQ:;AVGO;-;Free Report;);as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.;"makeArticleAd();";And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...;3 Key Segments;Though Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure if;AT&T;,;Cisco;or;Alphabet;are customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.;Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.;Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers like;Apple;with radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.;The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.;"While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.";And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.;Bear of the Day;:;I don't enjoy kicking this once-beloved company when it's down, but;Valeant Pharmaceuticals (;NYSE:;VRX;-;Free Report;);has it coming (again) as earnings estimates slip.;In the past week, another investment bank revised lower their EPS projection for this year, knocking the the Zacks Consensus down to $5.17 from $5.30.;"And in the past 90 days, the profit outlook has fallen from $7.70. This puts annual growth at -5.6% after a 2016 that could end up at over -30% ""growth.""";This is why VRX shares are in the cellar of the Zacks Rank again.;But it doesn't mean you should run out and sell yours only $1 from multi-year lows. The company is still projected to deliver nearly $9.2 billion in sales this year with hundreds of products and steady earners like Jublia and Wellbutrin.;The unknown risks are what happens with any legal investigations or the company's massive debt load. The current debt-to-equity ratio is over 7X for this $4.7 billion company and the debt-to-capital ratio may be over 87X.;Analysts Weigh In On the Debt Issue;On January 11, Canaccord Genuity analyst Neil Maruoka was encouraged by Valeant's recent moves to address the leverage...;"""Valeant has taken its first significant steps towards de-levering its balance sheet, announcing the divestiture of Dendreon and several dermatology brands (including CereVe) for combined cash consideration of ~$2.1 billion.""";"The analyst noted that the downside of this move is that the company may be forced to sell more quality drug franchises like CereVe, thus hurting sales and operating cash flow. ""Following these divestitures, we estimate that Valeant will have total debt of $28.3 billion remaining, representing a leverage ratio of 6.9x forward EBITDA (down from 7.1x previously).""";On January 20, Deutsche Bank reiterated their Hold rating on VRX shares and dropped their price target from $24 to $20. Analyst Gregg Gilbert talked about the company's challenges...;"""We expect VRX to provide its 2017 outlook sometime between now and when it reports 4Q results (date not yet set). Recall that management provided 'hand signals' on its 3Q call in November that revenue and EBITDA would be down in 2017 vs. 2016. In anticipation of this event, we have updated our model to reflect recent developments and management commentary. The key elements of our changes relate to recently-announced divestitures, loss of exclusivity (LOE) for several products in 2016/17, and FX headwinds.""";Additional content:;Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in     India;On Wednesday,;Apple (;NASDAQ:;AAPL;-;Free Report;);executives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.;Like many tech corporations-think Amazon (NASDAQ:;AMZN;-;Free Report;) and Netflix (NASDAQ:;NFLX;-;Free Report;) - Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.;"""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""";The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on by;Times of India;. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.;According to;CNNMoney;, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country. However, Apple's products are not cheap, and most of India's 1.3 billion people have an average annual income of $1,500.;Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017;In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?;Who wouldn't?

Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus;January 26, 2017, 09:23:25 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Facebook Inc's;(NASDAQ:;FB;) virtual reality division Oculus has had a rough six months, but it looks as though the company is ready to to push VR in 2017 and turn things around. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announce that;Hugo Barra will be joining FB to lead VR efforts;, including Oculus. If the name sounds familiar it should. Barra is very well known in the technology industry.;"makeArticleAd();";Source: Facebook;So who is Hugo Barra? He was in the news just last week when it was revealed he was leaving Chinese consumer technology giant;Xiaomi;.;He was hired in 2013 to lead that company's efforts to polish its image in western markets and help push its products into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he was returning to his Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.;What Does Hugo Barra Bring to FB?;Prior to Xiaomi, he served as;Alphabet Inc's;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) Google vice president of Android product management.;In his announcement of Barra's hire, Zuckerberg wrote:;"""I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team. Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting.";"I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people. Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform.""";FB's Oculus Challenges;When Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, the prospects for its new virtual reality division seemed limitless. But for the last six months, the division has been struggling.;"10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017";Founder Palmer Luckey was bringing in;bad press over his political views;, complaints over the high;prices for its Oculus Rift headset;and the new Touch Controllers continued, and;Sony Corp (ADR);(NYSE:;SNE;) unexpectedly began to gain traction with both consumers and game developers with its much more affordable Playstation VR. In December, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down. Now, FB and Luckey are;tied up in a lawsuit;claiming the Oculus founder stole trade secrets and violated copyrights in order to develop his Oculus Rift VR headset.;On top of all this, the hype over virtual reality is beginning to fade. After being a major part of past Consumer Electronics shows, there was a feeling that;VR wasn't particularly compelling at CES 2017;.;In short, it's understandable why FB wants to kickstart Oculus. An industry veteran like Hugo Barra -someone who is experienced in leading a critical division in a technology giant and skilled at promotion - may well be the answer.;Kickstarting Oculus;When Barra takes over at Oculus, there are a few immediate challenges to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyers will be able to manage most of that.;The bigger issue in terms of getting consumers to buy into the Oculus rift is pricing. The Oculus Rift already has mindshare as the VR headset people think of. But where the Oculus Rift was once pretty much the only game in town, every major consumer technology company - except;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) - is offering virtual reality gear, and it's almost always cheaper.;Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL);That wouldn't be such a big deal if you were looking at $100 versus $75. But an Oculus Rift plus Touch Controllers goes for $798. Then you need a reasonably powerful PC (many computer owners would have to upgrade), which is at least another $1,000. In comparison, a complete Sony Playstation VR system (including the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstation VR headset is compatible with the original PS4 - which many gamers already own, so that brings their investment to just $500.;Largely as a result of those cost differences, it's;estimated Sony will have sold over 745,000 Playstation VR systems in 2016;, while projections are for the Oculus Rift to hit just 355,000.;The hire of Hugo Barra sets the stage for FB to aggressively promote the technical superiority of its Oculus virtual reality technology over that used by competitors like Sony. It's also a good move in promoting developer relations in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compelling VR content. And if he can find some wiggle room to get Oculus Rift pricing down a bit, Barra stands a good chance of turning things around for Facebook's virtual reality division in 2017.;As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;3 Things Apple Inc.

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards this Time?;January 26, 2017, 07:44:00 AM EDT;Apple, Inc.;AAPL;is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 31. Last quarter, it posted a 0.60% positive earnings surprise. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.11%.;Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.;Factors to Consider;Investors will be looking forward to sales numbers for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. iPhone continues to the primary revenue contributor for Apple. Slowdown in the demand for iPhone has emerged as a big concern for Apple. Over the past one year, sales have dipped given overall weakness in the smartphone market, observe analysts. Per analysts, waning demand from markets like China and U.S., which are Apple's biggest markets, has been widely reflected on iPhone sales numbers.;Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone growth in China. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone unit sales came in at about 45.5 million, down 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also declined 13% from the year-ago quarter to $28.2 billion (60% of total revenue).;"Plus analysts also observe that the hype surrounding iPhone 8 will also dent sales. iPhone 8 is set to be launched later this year, marking the tenth anniversary of the revolutionary iPhone. It reportedly has amazing features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor and wireless charging. What is more exciting is that Apple is rumored to launch three iPhones (instead of two) including a new 5.8 inch model. All this is likely to put consumers on hold for some more time. iPhone 8 is already dubbed as a ""super cycle"".";However, given the troubles in iPhone, Apple has been focused on other drivers like Services, Music and App store to boost revenues. A few days back, Apple announced that its App Store generated sales of more than $20 billion for developers in 2016, up 40% from 2015.  Apple keeps 30% of all App Store sales. Apple stated that its top grossing markets were the U.S., China, Japan. China witnessed growth of over 90% year over year.;Apple also announced that Apple Music has crossed 20 million paid users. Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices.;Plus, it continues to increase focus on emerging markets to boost iPhone sales. In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Also, a robust cash position and shareholder friendly policies are long-term positives.;For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $76 billion to $78 billion.;Gross margin is expected within 38% to 38.5%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.9 billion to $7 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.;Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise;Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise;|;Apple Inc. Quote;Earnings Whispers?;Our proven model does not conclusively show that Apple will beat earnings estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive;Earnings ESP;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.;Zacks ESP;: Apple has an Earnings ESP of -0.93% as the Most Accurate Estimate is $3.19 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.22.

"Western Digital (WDC) Beats Q2 Earnings; '17 View Positive";January 26, 2017, 07:26:00 AM EDT;Western Digital Corp.;WDC;reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share, which increased 33.7% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings were much better than management's revised guided range of $2.10-$2.15 per share.;"makeArticleAd();";Moreover, including stock-based compensation, earnings were $1.98 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33 cents. Further, revenues of almost $4.89 billion surged 47.4% year over year and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.75 billion.;Western Digital witnessed strong demand for both hard drive and NAND-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications, as well as better than expected PC demand in the reported quarter.;Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     Surprise;Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise;|;Western Digital Corporation Quote;Segment Revenue Details;Client devices (49.5% of total revenue) surged 52.9% year over year to $2.42 billion. The revenue synergies from SanDisk acquisition benefitted results in the quarter. Management noted that increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this business.;Client solutions (22% of total revenue) increased a whopping 134.4% to $1.08 billion. Robust holiday season sales drove results. The company noted that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew in the quarter.;During the quarter, Western Digital announced new retail products including the four terabyte My Passport, eight terabyte My Book for the PC and a new four terabyte hard drive for Apple's;AAPL;Macintosh. During the quarter, Western Digital commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of its 64-layer product.;Data center devices and solutions (28.5% of total revenue) increased 9.2% to $1.39 billion on the back of strong demand for high capacity storage devices. Petabyte growth of almost 40% year over year for capacity optimized hard drive was in line with management expectations. Solid adoption of 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive was also noted in the quarter.;During the quarter, Western Digital shipped 44.8 million HDDs at an average selling price (ASP) of $62, up from $61 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, reported shipments of 44.762 million were down from 49.688 million in the year-ago quarter.;Western Digital's market share in the total addressable market (TAM) came in at 39.9% compared with 43.2% in the year-ago quarter.;Operating Details;Adjusted gross margin expanded 810 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.4%. The figure was better than management's guidance of 35%. The expansion was driven by lower product cost and pricing improvement.;Reported operating expenses, as percentage of revenues climbed 50 bps to 20.2%, owing to 20 bps increase in research and development (R&D) expense and 10 bps growth in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense.;As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded 590 bps to 17.6% in the reported quarter.;Interest expense was $224 million a massive increase from $7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.;Acquisition Synergies;Western Digital stated that it is on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. The company achieved $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis at the end of the reported quarter.;In terms of SanDisk integration, at the end of second quarter the company realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run-rate basis. This is in line with the company's 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.;Balance Sheet/Cash Flow;As of Dec 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $4.94 billion up from $4.33 billion as of Sep 30. Long-term debt during the quarter was $12.94 billion down from $13.06 billion at the end of previous quarter.;During the quarter, Western Digital generated $1.06 billion in cash from operations compared with $440 million in the previous quarter.;Guidance;For third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.;Adjusted gross margin is expected to be 38% backed by continued favorable pricing and product mix across the company's businesses. Total operating expenses are expected to be approximately $800 million.;Interest expense is anticipated to be almost $205 million.;Management expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $2.00-$2.10 per share for the third quarter.;Our Take;We believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company's growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is significantly positive, in our view.;We remain encouraged by the company's launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Continued investments in product innovation could result in flattish margins in the near term.;Further, Western Digital's entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.;Moreover, the SanDisk acquisition not only expands Western Digital's offerings in the SSD segment but also provides a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate Technology;STX;.;We note that Western Digital shares have outperformed the Zacks;Computer Storage Devices;industry in the past one-year. While shares gained 80.9%, the industry advanced 22.4% in the same period. We expect the momentum to persist given the impressive result and positive guidance in the rest of fiscal 2017.;Zacks Rank & Key Picks;Western Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Bull of the Day: Broadcom (AVGO);January 26, 2017, 07:00:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();";Seems it was only a month ago I writing about;Broadcom (AVGO);as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.;And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...;3 Key Segments;Though Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure if;AT&T;(T),;Cisco;(CSCO), or;Alphabet;(GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.;Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.;Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers like;Apple (AAPL);with radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.;The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.;"While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.";And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.;I Have $250... Do I Hear $300?;So what has changed in a month to make Broadcom the Bull of the Day again?;"Simply this: the stock took off over 10% to new highs in the past six sessions as a couple of analysts bolstered their view of this must-own tech ""arms dealer."" While I've been following fund managers into AVGO for nearly 3 years, the growth story is not over.";On January 18, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his Top Pick rating on AVGO shares and raised his view of the company's long term earnings potential to $17 EPS on the heels of the acquisition of Brocade (BRCD). Here's what he had to say...;"""Our analysis suggests the underlying EPS power of AVGO increases materially post BRCD (especially assuming they raise $1.5-2.0B from networking & real estate sales). We think AVGO could achieve >$17.00 of EPS by FY19 (prior $16) and the stock should work in an upside scenario to $250+.""";Oddly, the analyst did not raise his existing price target from $200.;So we'll leave that to a bolder fan of the company...;On January 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenback raised his price target on Broadcom to $240 from $210, and obviously reiterated his Overweight rating. Here's the MS view...;"""Increasing our PT to $240 from $210 and highlighting a bull case valuation of $300. Our PT is based on a 15X P/E on CY18 EPS, representing a turn increase from the current multiple but still a conservative 20% discount to the high end Semiconductor peers and 15% below the market. AVGO's multiple has been flat (100% of stock appreciation has been driven by growth in EPS) compared to a roughly 2x turn increase in semiconductor stocks, with investors unwilling to pay up for acquired growth.";"""However, we now have increased conviction that clearer focus on its outperforming core business, materially higher cash returns and ongoing margin expansion will drive a re-rating over the next 6-12 months.";"""The combination of Avago and Broadcom is unmatched in Networking (40% sales) in our view, which has positive implications for both growth (share gains) and profitability. We also think the company remains well positioned in RF to exploit the next growth driver of carrier aggregation, leveraging its leadership in premium filters and multiplexers.""";The AVGO Campaign;"And there you have an update on the continuing saga that I call ""The AVGO Campaign."" It tells you what works and makes you money in a bull market: finding earnings momentum winners that you know institutions will continue to buy until the cycle ends.";"Consider AVGO your ""playbook stock"" for how to use the Zacks Rank to swing trade fundamentally-strong companies quarter after quarter.";You can find out more by following me in my;TAZR Trader;service.;Zacks' best stocks under $10;As a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy, today's Bull of the Day has a short-term 1 to 3-month profit zone.

3 Big Tech Companies About to Report Earnings;January 25, 2017, 08:05:00 PM EDT;Earnings season is well under way, and some big tech names are   up next. In the coming days, investors will watch;Alphabet;(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) ,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) , and;Facebook;(NASDAQ: FB) report results for their most recently ended   quarters. With market capitalizations in the hundreds of billions   of dollars, investors all over the world will be watching   closely. Ahead of their earnings releases, here's a brief   overview of some keys areas to watch.;Image source: Getty Images.;"makeArticleAd();";Alphabet: How about that new Google-branded     hardware?;With its fourth quarter including the launch of some important   new Google-branded hardware, investors should look for an update   from management on how the products performed during the quarter.   In October, Alphabet launched its Google Pixel smartphone and a   Google Home voice-activated smart speaker. Yes, the bulk of the   company's revenue will still come from its search and advertising   business, but a high-performing hardware could signal growth   potential.;On average, analysts are expecting Alphabet to report   fourth-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $25.18 billion and   9.64, respectively. These results would be up 18% and 11%   compared to the year-ago quarter.;Alphabet reports results after market close on Thursday, Jan.   26.;Beyond looking to Alphabet's Google-branded hardware and the   company's financial results, investors may want to take the time   to look at;the trajectory of the company's paid clicks and   cost per click;-- two important metrics for Alphabet's core search business.;iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.;Apple: Will guidance point to growth or     decline?;When Apple reports results for its first fiscal quarter of   2017 (or the fourth calendar quarter of 2016), one key area to   watch will be the company's guidance. While Apple is expecting   its first-quarter revenue to be slightly higher than in the   year-ago quarter, ending an unfortunate streak of three quarters   of year-over-year declines, it's not clear whether the company   can sustain growth throughout fiscal 2017.;Analysts are expecting Apple to report first-quarter revenue   and EPS of $77.4 billion and $3.22. This compares to revenue and   EPS of $75.9 billion and $3.28 in the year-ago quarter.;Apple reports its financial results after market close on   Tuesday, Jan. 31.;To get a closer look at the metrics that will matter when   Apple reports first-quarter results, here's a more comprehensive;earnings preview;.;Facebook: Is revenue growth about to slow?;The key thing for Facebook investors to watch when the world's   largest social network reports fourth-quarter results will be the   degree to which revenue growth decelerates. Facebook CFO David   Wehner has been warning that revenue growth rates are going to   begin coming down. Of course, with revenue increasing a whopping   56% year over year in Facebook's third quarter, even a meaningful   deceleration in its fourth quarter will still likely represent   big growth for the company.;Image source: The Motley Fool.;Analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue and   non-GAAP EPS of about $8.49 billion and $1.31, up about 45% and   66%, respectively. Therefore, analysts do expect Facebook's   business growth to decelerate, but not too significantly.;Facebook reports fourth-quarter results after market close on   Wednesday, Feb. 1.;For a more in-depth overview of what to expect from Facebook's   earnings report, check out this;earnings preview;.;Stay tuned at The Motley Fool for more coverage of these   companies throughout earnings season.;Find out why Facebook;is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now;Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Earnings: Why QCOM Stock Is A Buy;January 25, 2017, 05:19:42 PM EDT;Shares of Qualcomm (;QCOM;) are edging lower in the after-market session Wednesday, down about 1.3% even though the wireless chip giant reported fiscal first quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the bottom-line miss, it’s tough to ignore the potential value QCOM stock presents.;Indeed, Qualcomm is facing some battles. Still, I would place a bet here on QCOM shares, which are priced at just 12 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $4.74 per share. Trading in the after-hour session at around $55, QCOM stock should reach $62 to $65 in the next 12 to 18 months delivering 18% returns. And the gains could go higher assuming its legal battle with Apple (;AAPL;) gets resolved, as I expect it will.;The company’s guidance, for instance, underscores the extent to which the management remains focus on execution. For the second quarter, Qualcomm is forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.25. This compares favorably toThomson Reuters forecast of about $1.20 a share. This make Qualcomm — from a valuation perspective — easy to like at current levels. I’ll get back to that in a moment. Let’s go through he numbers.;"makeArticleAd();";For;the quarter that ended December;, the San Diego-based company reported a net income of $700 million, or 46 cents a share, down from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, the company would have earned $1.19 a share, which beat analysts estimates by a penny. First quarter revenue rose 4% year over year to $6 billion, but fell shy on estimates of $6.12 billion.;“We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf in a staement. “Looking ahead, the pending NXP acquisition accelerates our strategic transformation in the high growth areas of automotive, IoT, security and networking. We are very well positioned to lead as the semiconductor engine for the intelligent, connected world.”;Revenue in the licensing business (Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)), which sells sells applications processors and cellular baseband devices, grew 13% year over year to $1.8 billion, while QCT revenue, which exists to monetize Qualcomm immense IP portfolio, came in at $4.1 billion. These gains offset revenue in Mobile station modem (MSM) chip shipments, which includes the Snapdragon LTE modem, which declined 10% year over year $217 million.;Ahead of the quarter, analysts were also looking to see if the company discusses its $38 billion purchase of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductor (;NXPI;). Qualcomm said it expects the transaction — subject to regulatory approval — to close by the end of 2017. What’s more, the company said during the quarter,  $1.2 billion was returned to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends.
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview;January 25, 2017, 04:29:30 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) stock has had an impressive run over the past few years. Heading into Thursday's fiscal second quarter earnings report, MSFT stock is right near an all-time high, having increased about 150% over the past few years.;Source:;Via Microsoft;What's interesting about the gains for such a large stock - MSFT is the third-most valuable company on U.S. markets, behind only;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) and;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) - is that they haven't been based on Microsoft earnings. Microsoft's EPS was $2.73 in fiscal 2012, and $2.79 in fiscal 2016.;"makeArticleAd();";Rather, the multiple investors assign to MSFT stock has expanded. It has more than doubled, in fact.;That multiple expansion has come from increasing confidence toward Microsoft's;future;"earnings potential, most notably in mobile and cloud. Where investors four to five years ago saw a fading giant whose earnings were likely to decline, Microsoft now looks like a sleeping giant. And investors clearly believe the company's self-described ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy is going to push Microsoft earnings up - at some point.";It's in that context that the market will analyze the Microsoft earnings report due on Thursday.;Microsoft's Growth Isn't There…Yet;It's always dangerous for an investor to believe that the numbers don't matter, but in the case of MSFT stock, the numbers really aren't the most important thing right now.;"10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017";Analyst consensus - informed in large part by Microsoft earnings guidance - doesn't predict a particularly impressive second quarter earnings report. The Street expects EPS to rise just a penny year-over-year, which given share repurchases, implies that Microsoft's total net profits actually will be lower in Q2 FY17 than they were ago.  Revenue is estimated to fall almost 2% year-over-year.;Microsoft's guidance projects growth in its Productivity & Business and Intelligent Cloud segments, but a sharp decline in More Personal Computing.;That shouldn't be surprising. Office 365 growth has helped business revenue, and the Azure platform continues to be a worthy, if still much smaller, competitor to Amazon Web Services in cloud. It's the potential for success in those products that has offset fears about continuing pressure on revenue from Windows, as PC sales decline and mobile usage increases.;Indeed, the gain in MSFT stock from $27 to $63 has come mostly from the transition.;The fears of Windows losses that led MSFT stock to be valued around 10x EPS in 2013 have turned to optimism toward growth in Azure, Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and other areas. That optimism has pushed the same stock to be valued at about 21x FY17 earnings.;So it seems unlikely that investors will focus on the major headline numbers coming out of the Microsoft earnings report. A beat or miss of a penny or two on earnings likely isn't going to drive the market's reaction to the report - particularly if that weakness comes from Windows. Rather, the focus is going to be on the growing, smaller, businesses, most notably Azure.;There's a reason Microsoft has steadily expanded its disclosure around Azure and cloud growth: That's where investor attention has been. And it seems likely that's where investor attention will stay coming out of the Q2 Microsoft earnings report.;What to Watch For in Microsoft Earnings;Investors seem likely to have some patience with a modest miss in the Microsoft earnings report, as expectations remain relatively low. The company still is getting out from under its deal with;Nokia Corp (ADR);(NYSE:;NOK;), and layoffs this year should provide a boost to margins over the next few quarters. Wall Street in particular isn't expecting growth to pick up until fiscal 2018, where sales are projected to grow more than 6% against a rate under 2% in fiscal 2017.;So what seems to be important in the Q2 Microsoft earnings report is whether the base of that growth is intact.;While Azure is estimated to generate just 3% of total revenue,;according;to analyst firm MKM Partners, its growth rate certainly will be watched closely. After a 140% increase in Q2 FY16, and 116% last quarter, any slowdown seems likely to hurt the stock. But another 100%-plus figure would give further evidence that Azure is a worthy competitor to AWS, and support the current MSFT stock price.;The cloud business as a whole - including Office 365 and Dynamics, which is trying to take share from;Salesforce.com, Inc.;(NYSE:;CRM;) - will be another area of post-earnings analysis.;Here's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock     Will Hit $75;What does that mean for Microsoft stock coming out of the Microsoft earnings report?;"Overall, it means that the quarter seems likely to be judged more on ""feel"" than on the hard numbers. Even though cloud and mobile still aren't the majority of MSFT revenue or earnings, they are the cornerstones of the Microsoft strategy going forward. And for now, it's relatively clear that the market is content to wait for those sales and profits - as long as it continues to trust in that strategy.";If Microsoft can deliver another earnings report that shows growth is on the horizon, MSFT stock likely will rise - even if the headline numbers aren't perfect. But if there's any sort of stumble in either cloud or mobile, that investor patience could reverse - quickly.;As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW     Still Bargains;7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     Around;Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI     Monster;The post;Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.
3 ETF Myths And 4 Trading Tips From The Man Who Helped Launch SPY;January 25, 2017, 04:25:07 PM EDT;Why is SPDR S&P 500 (;SPY;), beloved of so many investors in exchange traded funds, like an   Apple (;AAPL;) iPhone? In both cases, the teams who helped launch the products   did not anticipate they would revolutionize an industry.;"""When we designed SPY, we had no idea how flexible the ETF   vehicle would turn out to be,"" Jim Ross, chairman of the global   SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors, said Tuesday at   the 10th annual Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. ""We   could not have imagined all the innovative ways ETFs are being   used today.""";Ross, who was part of the team that launched SPY 24 years ago,   made that point as he drew a parallel between the iPhone's impact   on the technology industry and ETFs' transformation of the   investment landscape.;"makeArticleAd();";As U.S. ETFs enter their 25th year, the ETF industry is   cheering both the fact that this investment vehicle holds a total   of more than $2 trillion in assets and that ETFs represent less   than 5% of the investable market - meaning, there's still plenty   of room to grow.;"ETFs certainly continue to be on a hot growth streak. ""ETF   assets have roughly doubled every three years over the past   decade,"" Ross said at a conference session titled ""The ETF   Revolution And What's Next For ETFs."" He said that there is no   reason why global ETF assets cannot cross $16 trillion by 2025 at   the continued annual growth rate of 19%.";Driving demand for, and innovative use of, ETFs are a host of   insurance companies, ETF strategists, sovereign wealth funds,   wealth management firms and even mutual funds, he added.;But Ross also pointed out that risks tied to;ETF   investing;include a persistent lack of understanding about these   investment vehicles. In his afternoon address, he sought to   debunk common myths about ETFs and offered some tips for trading   ETFs.;Myth 1:;"""ETF liquidity (issues) could blow up the fixed-income   market."" Despite this common perception, ETFs comprise less than   1% of the total fixed-income market, Ross said. That makes it   unlikely they will ""blow up"" an entire market.";In fact, Ross believes fixed-income ETFs can be more efficient   than other fixed-income products, as assets in them have   continued to increase to more than $400 billion today. And   although the underlying fixed-income market can be opaque,   fixed-income ETFs offer transparency in terms of trading costs   and portfolio holdings, he added.;Myth 2:;"""ETFs gone wild."" Referring to the belief that the   proliferation of ETFs can harm investors, Ross said he believes   ETF issuers like his own company are diligent about making sure   new launches meet existing needs. Even a crudely constructed ETF,   he added, displays the American value of ""take an idea to market   and test it out.""";"The lesson here, Ross said, is that ""all ETF investors need to   understand what they are buying, when they are buying.""";Myth 3:;"""ETFs fail to track intrinsic value in volatile markets.""   According to Ross, ETFs have in some cases helped the process of   price discovery in challenging markets.";"""That happened on Aug. 24 (2015),"" he said. ""SPY traded   efficiently throughout the day"" despite the extreme volatility in";the stock market;that day.;Ross noted, too, that following that day's trading;disruptions in some stocks and ETFs;, an ETF industry coalition took action to harmonize exchange   rules to address the issue.;The lesson here, Ross added, is to understand ETF trading   basics:;1. If you don't have to trade in volatile markets, don't.;2. Don't trade near the market open. Volatility tends to be   high as the markets price in the news.;3. Use limit orders. These are generally seen to have   advantages over market orders in terms of price control and   protection.;4. Reconsider the use of stop orders. As many ETF investors   unhappily discovered on Aug. 24, stop orders become market orders   once the price is hit. And they run the risk of selling for much   below their intended price in serious market disruptions.;A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price   of the stock reaches a specified price. A limit order is an order   to buy or sell a stock at a specified price or better.;Introducing Ross to the audience, Inside ETFs CEO Matt Hougan   made note of Ross' leadership role in the industry for more than   two decades.;"""There's a reason everyone loves him,"" Hougan said. ""He's the   chairman of the ICI (Investment Company Institute) ETF committee.   He does education everywhere he can.""";The Inside ETFs conference;concludes Wednesday.;RELATED:;The 'Trump ETFs' Spotlighted As 6 Best     Investment Ideas For 2017
Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL-QCOM Deal, FB's Zuckerberg Testifies;January 25, 2017, 04:17:00 PM EDT;With the 45;th;President of the United States vowing to bring back jobs to the country, teach China a lesson and institute large-scale tax reform, there has been a great deal of uncertainty surrounding technology stocks. To make matters worse, President Trump has an axe to grind with Amazon;AMZN;and Apple;AAPL;while most Alphabet;GOOGL;executives have openly supported the democrats going into the elections.;So companies are now making nice with the President like Tesla's Elon Musk, who has changed tunes and is now tweeting his support. It's been reported that Google's Schmidt has also found reasons to visit the President. Executives that have supported Trump from the start are better off: some speculate that Zuckerberg is considering politics while ex-Microsoft;MSFT;and GM employee Chris Liddell is moving to the White House as assistant to the President and director of strategic initiatives. Oracle CEO Safra Catz joined the executive committee of Trump's presidential transition team in December.;Then there's Cramer, promising us that the post inauguration sell-off won't last and that it's actually an opportunity to buy stocks.;Amidst all the excitement surrounding the swearing in, the FTC sued Qualcomm;QCOM;for anti-competitive practices while Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend Facebook's;FB;purchase of Oculus. So let's dig in.;Apple Forced to Use Qualcomm Chips;"Following similar lawsuits, huge fines ($1 billion in China and $890 million in Korea) and anticompetitive investigations in Taiwan and the EU, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued Qualcomm for ""de facto exclusive deals that were as effective as express purchase requirements and that effectively foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from gaining processor business at Apple.""";The FTC alleges that Qualcomm allowed Apple billions in discounts for exclusively using its chips and not using the competing 4G Wi-Max standard that Intel was pushing. This agreement, running from 2011 to 2016, ultimately killed WiMax. Apple wasted no time in sourcing from Intel after the expiry of the agreement in Sep 2016.;"Another point in contention is Qualcomm's practice of limiting access to its cellular chips and then hiking royalty payments, amounting to ""a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm's competitors."" The FTC filed the lawsuit after a 2-1 vote. Qualcomm has of course denied the charges while Apple chose not to comment.";Following the FTC lawsuit, Apple filed one of its own against Qualcomm for a billion dollars. The amount is what Apple alleges that Qualcomm is witholding for rebates. Like the FTC says, the deal was to keep Qualcomm chips in Apple products and is a fair indication that Qualcomm finally has some real competition.;Mark Zuckerberg Testifies;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand last week to deny charges that Facebook was aware of the violation of any employee agreement between Occulus head John Carmack and its former employer id Software, a unit of ZeniMax, the plaintiff in this case. He also denied that the technology developed by the startup Occulus and its founder Palmer Luckey was based on copyrighted technology belonging to ZeniMax.;"Carmack previously testified that he copied files from ZeniMax before moving to Occulus but did not use the information in Occulus and the terms of his employment allowed him to get involved with Occulus even while in ZeniMax employ. But the thing that could cost Facebook at this point is ZeniMax lawyer Toni Sammi's question: ""So your plan for a $2-point-something billion deal was to begin legal diligence on Friday, and sign the deal on Monday, over a weekend, right?"" to which Zuckerberg said, ""Yeah.""";Company;Last Week;Last  6 Months;AAPL;+2.09%;+21.62%;FB;+0.33%;+6.42%;YHOO;-0.14%;+10.80%;GOOGL;-0.16%;+9.94%;MSFT;+0.21%;+16.26%;INTC;+0.63%;+5.38%;CSCO;+0.20%;+0.64%;AMZN;-0.65%;+9.82%;Other stories you might have missed-;Corporate;India Considering Apple Case;": It's hard to tell just how badly India wants Apple to manufacture in the country. But if government officials agree to Apple's demands, it would indicate that they want it bad. Because Apple has asked for just about every concession possible, ranging from reduction in import duties on smartphones, customs duty exemption on manufacturing equipment and raw materials, a ""less-intrusive"" customs procedure to be completed in 30 minutes, the right to import and refurbish iPhones that are more than 3 years old so they can be exported, and so forth.";Apple is trying to convince government officials that Indian made iPhones won't be competitive unless they give in to these demands even as its manufacturing costs in China are on the rise. But Asian phone makers are already manufacturing in the country with no such concessions, so the regulations themselves may need to be altered and relaxed to accommodate not just Apple but also other manufacturers. This could take time.;On a positive note, Reuters reports that Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has mentioned the setting up of a government panel headed by the cabinet secretary that would now clear investment proposals in the electronics sector above $1 billion, instead of them going through multiple government departments.;Microsoft Executive Joins Baidu;: Baidu has appointed Qi Lu as its Chief Operating Officer and Group Head as it turns focus to artificial intelligence as the next growth driver. The company was mixed up in a scandal involving medical ads that led to stricter government regulations and consequently hit its revenues.;Lu left Microsoft last year on health concerns but was in charge of its search business and also part of the team involved in architecting its artificial intelligence and bots technology. He holds more than 40 U.S. patents.;Google Ad Auctions Are Suspect;: The Wall Street Journal has independently confirmed that ads for Google products and the products of its sister companies usually find the top spot on the search engine results page. On checking 25K search results, it found that Google products occupied the top spot 91% of the time and the top two spots 43% of the time.;Google has said that this is because it is also a buyer of ads, so its position comes from paying a higher price. It also says that this doesn't raise prices because when others bid for the price, it's as if Google isn't bidding. Bottom line: other advertisers lose the top spot no matter what they bid for it. Google reportedly removed its ads in a number of cases when confronted with the data last December.;Amazon, Apple End Audiobook Exclusivity Deal;: Apple and Amazon have decided to end the deal initiated back in 2008, according to which Amazon subsidiary Audible became the exclusive supplier of audiobooks to Apple and was barred from selling to any other party. The agreement was actually serving no one because the market for audiobooks has advanced since then and it's now in the interest of both parties to be able to source from others and in Audible's case, to also be able to sell on other platforms. Nonetheless, it was preceded by regulatory scrutiny of the deal by German and EU competition authorities that felt it was inflating prices.;Pandora Shares Gain;: Pandora preannounced fourth-quarter results that it said exceeded its revenue and EBITDA targets. This came as a relief because it has been lowering expectations the last two quarters indicating continuing bad news. Moreover, Pandora also said that the $5-a-month Pandora Plus garnered 365K new subscribers in the quarter and the Pandora Premium service remained on track to launch later this quarter. It also expects to lay off around 7% of the U.S. workforce, which will further boost margins.;Legal/Regulatory;Cisco-Arista Developments;: The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency has expressed concern that its earlier decision to lift the ban on Arista switches may have been incorrect. Following conversations with Cisco;CSCO;, the CBP therefore intends to reinstate the ban. Arista has said that it will respond to Cisco points and re-engage with the CBP.;In the meantime, U.S.-manufactured switches will have to make do, which can result in supply glitches and pressure on its gross margin. On Dec 2, the ITC judge ruled that Arista patents infringe on Cisco's and Arista has subsequently produced workaround while denying the charges. A full commission review of the judge's decision will be completed by Apr 9.;New Technology/Products;Google to Launch Android One Phones In U.S.;: Google's high-end Pixel phones are mostly unavailable, but it's already gearing up to launch the low-end ($200-$300) Android One devices in the country by the middle of the year. The goal seems to be to build brand value and familiarize people with the Android ecosystem.;Android One was first launched in India and later in other countries including Japan and then Europe. It is a system under which Google agrees beforehand with handset manufacturers to push out Android updates as soon as they are available so the experience is true to the latest iteration of the software.;M&A and Collaborations;HPE Buying Simplivity;: Hewlett Packard Enterprise is dishing out $650 million to buy SimpliVity, the second largest provider of hyperconvergence software (after Nutanix which has over 50% market share). The company describes a hyperconverged system as one that integrates compute, storage and networking into a pre-configured system, managed by a user-friendly software platform that doesn't require extensive IT staff for set up and management.;Within a couple of months after the deal closes, HPE will offer a range of integrated HPE SimpliVity hyperconverged systems based on HPE ProLiant Servers. The acquisition significantly strengthens its position in the space where competitors like Cisco and Dell/EMC base their hyperconvergence solutions on market leader Nutanix or Simplivity software. HPE will initially support current SimpliVity customers.;Cisco, Ericsson Join Forces in Australia;: The collaboration between Ericsson and Cisco on telecom cloud infrastructure has yielded a major customer in Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA). The companies will virtualize Vodafone's infrastructure, enabling it to improve customer service and user experience while increasing network agility, reducing opex and capex, and speeding up the deployment of services. The partnership has reportedly generated 60 new deals and is expected to generate revenue of a billion dollars to each partner by 2018.;Microsoft Acquires Simplygon;: Microsoft has acquired 3D data optimization specialist Simplygon of Sweden for an undisclosed sum. This is intended to play an important role in developing its 3D For Everyone strategy, which is part of the Windows 10 Creators Update. 3D optimization is used by game developers and others to facilitate 3D content creation.;Simplygon also does more than this: it has already started optimizing content for AR and VR technology, including for Microsoft's Hololens. Microsoft believes that by making the technology a part of its creators update, users will be empowered to capture, create and share 3D content thus augmenting their productivity, collaboration and creativity.;Google Buys Twitter Developers Platform;: Google has acquired Fabric, which is based on Crashlytics technology (crash analytics, app feedback and real-time analytics) that Twitter acquired back in 2013. Google hasn't said how much it's paying for Fabric, but has said that it will be a part of its cloud based mobile software effort called Firebase that was itself acquired in 2014. Firebase offers mobile app developers tools to build and monitor their apps, so any attempt to build its capabilities should help the company attract developers.;Alibaba Has Long-term Digital Deal;: Alibaba and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) signed a deal, according to which Alibaba will be responsible for the IOC's digital presence through its cloud platform. The deal makes Alibaba the digital sponsor of the Olympics in cloud services, e-commerce and television for a period running through 2028. While immediate returns may not there, this lends credibility to the service and should help Alibaba win big customer accounts.;WDC Considering Toshiba Stake;: Nikkei Asian Review has reported that Toshiba is looking to spin off or sell off a 20% stake in its chip business in which case Western Digital might be the one picking it up. Toshiba is in trouble right now as it has to deal with an unprofitable nuclear business and accounting scandal that requires it to cough up some cash. Selling off a share to its longtime partner Western Digital (the two operate a flash memory fab in Japan) might be just the answer it needs.;Some Numbers;UK App Store Prices Up;: As a result of the pound's continued declines, Apple has been compelled to raise App store prices by as much as 25%.;Intel Invests in Retail Tech;": At the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York, Intel said that it intended to invest $100 million in retail technology over the next five years. It also announced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform, which uses a combination of sensors, software kits and other hardware solutions to provide ""in-the-moment information about what customers are buying, what they want and how to manage inventory so it arrives just in time for customers to take it home"".";Companies That Reported Results Last Week;: CHKP, NFLX, PLXS, IBM, SWKS;Some Companies Reporting This Week;: CA, XLNX, FFIV, DST, AVT, YHOO, TXN, BABA, EBAY, LRCX, TER, GOOGL, KLAC, PYPL, IBM, SWKS, SIMO, GLW, STX, WDC, INTC, MSFT, JNPR, AMCC, VMW, SYNA;Zacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term   Profit;Today you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Qualcomm Messed With the Wrong Customer;January 25, 2017, 03:41:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;"""Let me get this straight.

In its;U.S. lawsuit;"filed last week, Apple alleges that Qualcomm ""attempted to extort   Apple"" into changing how it responded to a regulatory antitrust   investigation in South Korea. The iPhone maker also argues that   it has been paying ""extortion-level royalties"" for years, due to   Qualcomm's """;no license, no chips;""" policy where Qualcomm would only sell chips to customers that   agreed to onerous licensing terms.";It seems as if Qualcomm has been getting away with this for   years, which is why its market power has grown so dramatically as   rivals fell by the wayside and exited the baseband processor   market. Most customers lack the operating scale, legal resources,   and financial incentive to effectively stand up to Qualcomm   through protracted litigation. Apple doesn't.;Apple bites back;So let me get this straight, Qualcomm: You think that your   biggest customer, one of the wealthiest, most powerful   corporations in the world that also has a reputation for;squeezing its suppliers;would quietly accept your oppressive contract terms and   never fight back.

More specifically, from 2011 to late 2016, Qualcomm had   extracted both exclusivity in supplying Apple with cellular   baseband modems as well as its silence. You may note in the chart   above how much sales increased during this time period. Apple was   restricted from actively complaining to law enforcement and   regulators, although it was allowed to respond if asked. So long   as Qualcomm maintained its lock on baseband chipsets, it had   incredible leverage and there wasn't a whole lot Apple could   do.;Enter;Intel;(NASDAQ: INTC) . Intel had been trying to crack the baseband   market for years with little to no success. Even today, Intel's   modems are technologically inferior to Qualcomm's, but they're   good enough and much cheaper, and Intel expects to catch up   within a few generations. The combination of Qualcomm's   exclusivity ending combined with Intel's ability to supply a   sufficiently competitive modem is the perfect storm for Apple to   unleash its pent-up discontent in court. The $1 billion that   Qualcomm is withholding was just the final straw.;Now that Apple has a path to an alternative supplier (even   though the majority of its basebands still come from Qualcomm)   and is no longer contractually obligated to keep quiet, Apple is   bringing a brutal suit against Qualcomm that;threatens Qualcomm's very business model;.

Intel Corporation Thinks It Can Catch Up to Qualcomm, Inc. in Modems;January 25, 2017, 02:58:00 PM EDT;The launch of the;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones market what was,   arguably, the most significant design win that microprocessor   giant;Intel;(NASDAQ: INTC) had ever scored in smartphones.;Image source: Intel.;"makeArticleAd();";A large portion of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus   smartphones include Intel's XMM 7360 cellular modem, and the   chipmaker seems to be working hard to ensure that it builds   compelling enough products to continue to win future iPhone   business.;At a recent investor conference, the head of Intel's Client   Computing Group, Navin Shenoy, spent some time talking about the   company's investments in and strategies related to cellular   modems. In this column, I'd like to go over the salient points of   that discussion.;"A ""strategic investment""";"Shenoy began by saying that cellular modems represent a   ""strategic investment"" for the chipmaker.";"""We do think that as the world gets more smart and connected,   you're going to need modems -- it's going to be a core   intellectual property, much like graphics was 10 years, 15 years   ago,"" for Intel, he explained.";Autonomous vehicles stand to benefit from cellular   connectivity. Image source: Intel.;"Shenoy went on to say that modems are going to be important in   many of the key areas that Intel wants to participate in,   including personal computers, cars, smartphones, and ""other   [Internet of things] applications.""";One modem a year keeps Apple interested;"The executive reiterated a commitment that other Intel   executives have made in the past -- Intel intends to release new   cellular modems each year. He also said that the company's next   generation cellular modem, branded the XMM 7480, is scheduled to   go into ""high-volume manufacturing"" during 2017. The 7360 entered   mass production in 2016.";Image source: Apple.;Considering that Apple is pretty much the only major buyer of   Intel's cellular modems, it's clear that Intel is aiming to   deliver new modems on this schedule so that its chips are ready   to go for when Apple launches new smartphones each fall.;Modem manufacturing strategy;It's well known that all the modems that Intel has released   thus far haven't been manufactured by Intel -- they're designed   by Intel and manufactured by third parties.;"Shenoy declined to comment on where Intel will be   manufacturing the next-generation XMM 7480 -- or, as he was quick   to point out, future modems -- but made it clear that Intel's   manufacturing choices would be made on a ""pragmatic basis"" and   that the company is evaluating both in-house manufacturing as   well as external options for future modems.";Catching up with the market leader;Qualcomm;"(NASDAQ: QCOM) is known for being the leading manufacturer of   cellular modems, but Shenoy did take the opportunity to brag a   little bit about the company's recently announced 5G modem,   referring to it as the ""world's first global 5G modem.""";Image source: Qualcomm.;"""All I can tell you is the investment in the modem portfolio   -- and the commitment to invest in the modem portfolio -- is very   strong and we think that over time we can be in an absolute   equivalent position to our competitors,"" Shenoy asserted.";"The executive conceded that the company is ""coming from a   position of being behind and so it's going to take us a few   generations to catch up.""";Catching up with the market leaders, particularly Qualcomm, is   going to be a tall order, but if the company can pull it off, I'm   sure that Apple -- which likes to have multiple sources for   critical components -- will be extremely happy.;10 stocks we like better than Qualcomm;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple, Inc. Brings Its Fight With Qualcomm to China;January 25, 2017, 02:30:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;Earlier this month,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) filed a;blockbuster lawsuit;against its most important supplier,;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) , alleging a wide range of transgressions that   were all intended to enhance Qualcomm's monopoly power over the   baseband processor market. That suit came just days after the;U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed;a similar regulatory antitrust complaint against the mobile chip   giant.;"makeArticleAd();";"Apple isn't stopping there; the Mac maker is now taking its   grievances to the Middle Kingdom.";There's more where that came from;Apple has filed not one, but two suits against Qualcomm in   Beijing,;Reuters;reports. The first is seeking 1 billion yuan (approximately $145   million) in damages, accusing Qualcomm of abusing its monopoly   power in the baseband market. The second alleges that Qualcomm   has not fulfilled its obligations to license its   standards-essential patents under fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) levels.;The fact that Apple is suing Qualcomm in China is notable for   a few reasons, the most obvious being that the scope of Apple's   complaints reaches beyond just the U.S. itself. Apple's lawsuit   in the U.S. was filed in the U.S. District Court of Southern   California. China also doesn't have a particularly good   reputation for enforcing intellectual property (IP) laws,   although the country has been making progress on improving its   legal frameworks. The discrepancy in IP enforcement is one reason   why many Chinese smartphone manufacturers, most notably Xiaomi,   are unable to expand operations into countries with stricter   enforcement.;China is also where the vast majority of Apple's contract   manufacturers are located, including its most prolific iPhone   assembler, Foxconn. These contract manufacturers are partially   responsible for Apple's predicament with Qualcomm. As noted in;Apple's U.S. complaint;, Qualcomm refuses to license its IP directly to Apple, instead   preferring to ink deals with Apple contract manufacturers that   pass along both the IP rights indirectly as well as the royalty   costs in full. Apple's manufacturing partners simply accept   Qualcomm's terms and do not negotiate, leaving Apple with massive   royalty bills.;Apple has long attempted to review the agreements between   Qualcomm and its contract manufacturers, but Qualcomm must   consent -- and it won't. I'm neither an American or Chinese   lawyer, but it seems possible that Apple is seeking legal   assistance in China so that it may gain access or somehow   restructure these agreements, although legal discovery in China   is significantly more restricted than here in the U.S. Even if   that's not the goal, it wouldn't hurt to collect more in monetary   damages by filing suit in multiple relevant jurisdictions, as   Apple says it's been overcharged by billions of dollars over the   past five years.;This serves as additional evidence that Apple has absolutely;no intention of settling;with Qualcomm. The company feels as if it has been wronged all   these years, being coerced into quietly overpaying Qualcomm for   half a decade. And now that Qualcomm's exclusivity has ended, the   time for reckoning has come.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Hinges on Same-Store Sales Numbers;January 25, 2017, 02:24:34 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;It's no secret that the retail sector and restaurant stocks are both suffering. Living in the world between the two, venerable slinger of legal stimulants;Starbucks Corporation;(NASDAQ:;SBUX;) is caught in the crosshairs of lower consumer spending. With its focus on both beverages and gifts, its earnings report is a critical one for SBUX. Even more so, since it has now started to refrain from providing forward guidance figures.;Source:;Javier González Via Flickr;The name of the game for SBUX will be same-store sales and whether or not its loyalty program is indeed paying benefits in the consumer slowdown.;"makeArticleAd();";For investors, this Starbucks earnings report is very much one to watch.;A Focus on Consumer Growth at SBUX;The so-called restaurant recession has even started to have its way with mighty Starbucks. Over the last few quarters, SBUX has seen its global traffic start to slip. Much of that slippage has come from the United States. Just ask;McDonald's Corporation;(NYSE:;MCD;) about its recent numbers coming from the U.S. The restaurant recession is real, and consumers are clamping down on the amount they are spending out to eat.;SBUX was considered more immune to the effects, but it looks like the coffee purveyor could get hit by the slowdown after all.;10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW     Still Bargains;During the;previously reported quarter,;SBUX posted just a 1% increase in global consumer traffic for the last 12 months. During the prior quarter, Starbucks posted a 3% jump. Just in the U.S., Starbucks actually reported a 1%;decline;in traffic. This dwindling of traffic resulted in same-store sales growth dropping to just a 5% increase vs. a 6% in each of the previous four fiscal years.;That drop can be a tad bit worrisome for SBUX stock owners. And considering that it has proved no guidance on what to expect, analysts don't exactly agree on what the jump - if any - will be.;But one thing they all agree on is that its revamped loyalty program and recent tech initiatives will be its saving grace.;SBUX changed the way it calculated rewards and free drinks a few quarters ago. The new system is proving to be a huge win for consumers and Starbucks itself.;"This ""digital ecosystem"" that links Starbucks Cards, apps, and various corporate partnerships with companies such as";Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) and the;New York Times Co;(NYSE:;NYT;) is continuing to drive sales at the firm and overcome potentially worse dips. Last quarter, payment via mobile means represented 6% of their total and saw a big increase. Traditional Starbucks card orders/payments also rose considerably.;With new plug-ins for its mobile app/loyalty rewards members, the hope is that SBUX stock can turn around the recent drop in sales/foot traffic.;Other efforts such as its continued focus on food should also help. SBUX is quickly turning into a lunch and mid-day destination, rather than just a place to get your morning cup of joe. However, even here, it has seen some adverse effects.;Its recent stoppage;of late-night beer and wine sales highlights the challenging restaurant environment.;Even with the declines, it is still expected to see a rise in total revenues for the quarter.;According to FactSet;, Starbucks is expected to report earnings per share of 52 cents. That's up from up from 46 cents reported for the same period last year. Revenues should clock in at $5.85 billion - up from $5.37 billion last year.;In the end, the focus will be 100% on the trend/pace of sales and store foot traffic. Investors will be looking to see if SBUX can stop the bleeding of foot traffic and reverse the trend.;SBUX Still a Profit Machine;For SBUX, the tale isn't about profits. It has those. The focus will come down to whether or not the giant can really overcome the new operating environment that all eateries and retailers are facing. It's tough out there - the recent decline in same-store sales highlight just;how;tough.;Intel Corporation (INTC) Q4 Earnings     Preview;However, don't forget that SBUX has more arrows in its quiver than the average retailer/restaurant stock.;This quarter will be all about how it uses those arrows and whether it can hit the bullseye. If it falters even a tad, investors could sell down SBUX shares.;As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     Around;The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for     Retirement;The post;Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Hinges on Same-Store Sales Numbers;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.
Your iPhone Already Uses Artificial Intelligence, But it's Just the Beginning;January 25, 2017, 02:19:00 PM EDT;We were all fascinated by Siri when she first burst onto the   scene five years ago. The world was captivated, the talking   computer had;finally;arrived and was easily available. Since then, more fascinating   examples of artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged. Siri is so   2011.;While other tech companies have been introducing;flashy new examples;of AI at play, it appeared that;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost its advantage and was falling behind in   the pursuit of this nascent technology. While some thought Apple   had languished, it turns out it has been quietly integrating AI   into many everyday features of its iconic iPhone. More   importantly, Apple says it's doing so while protecting your   privacy.;"makeArticleAd();";Apple has been quietly upgrading Siri using artificial   intelligence. Image source: Pixabay.;There's more going on under the hood;Siri got its first major overhaul in mid-2014 when its voice   recognition was shifted to a neural network. This AI model,   designed to simulate the human brain, is a combination of   software and algorithms that improves over time by learning from   its experience. This was the first of many such upgrades to Siri,   all without much fanfare.;Apple has been using AI to improve a number of its native   apps. The Maps app will automatically identify traffic problems   and route you around them. It will also help you find your car in   the parking lot. The Photos app will identify the people in your   photos and can group them together. The Memories app will collect   images from your phone to create an event video, memorializing a   recent outing or vacation. iMessage will automatically translate   text to emojis.;Siri can interact with third-party apps to order pizza,   schedule an Uber or Lyft, or start a workout. It will integrate   with other popular apps such as WhatsApp, Skype, WeChat, and   Pinterest.;Apple isn't stopping there. Siri is available on Apple Watches   and TVs, and with the macOS Sierra update, it will even work   on laptops and Macintosh computers. It will now search for   documents on your computer and narrow those searches even further   using keywords.;Better selfies and a secret...;Improved images using AI technology. Image source:     Apple.;Apple used AI to strengthen the capabilities of the camera on   its iPhone 7. It claims this is not only the best camera in any   smartphone, but thanks to the company's software, the iPhone 7   can produce images that once required an expensive camera and   professional photographer. Using AI and algorithms, it can   distinguish between the subject of the photo and the background,   which simply wasn't possible with previous smartphone cameras due   to the size of the aperture. This latest upgrade can also   determine depth with the introduction of two lenses.;There is intriguing evidence that more powerful AI may be   coming with the recent discovery of;a specialized chip;within the iPhone. Thefield-programmable gate array processor   inside the latest iPhone can be re-purposed after installation,   and has historically been used to accelerate machine learning.   Apple has repeatedly said that it would protect user privacy, and   does so by keeping the most sensitive user data stored locally on   the device. This latest revelation would be in keeping with that   philosophy by enabling more sophisticated machine learning   capabilities directly on the phone.;"While other companies are uploading data to the cloud to   achieve advances in AI, Apple says it can make the same gains,   all while protecting your privacy. It's tapping the concept of   differential privacy, which seeks to identify trends without   sacrificing personal data. In this technology, electronic ""noise""   is added to information on the phone, protecting the raw data and   transmitting only the trends. This approach keeps user data at   the local phone level while allowing Apple to continue its   advances in AI.";In a recent interview, Tim Cook said:;Look at the (technologies) that will be dominant in     smartphones of the future -- like AI. AI will make this product     even more essential to you. It will become even a better     assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren't     leaving home without it today -- you're really going to be     connected to it in the future...we do all of that while     protecting your privacy. Instead of passing all that     information to the cloud, where we're maintaining it all, we do     a lot of it on the device itself. So you're in control of your     own data.;Foolish final word;As the use of AI becomes more prolific, justifiable concerns     regarding protecting individual information may become more     prevalent. If Apple succeeds in gathering the data it needs     while still protecting the data of its users, this may force     other companies to follow suit. Apple has always demonstrated a     concern for protecting customer data. In a recent extreme     example, it stood against the FBI in early 2016, rejecting a     request to unlock the iPhone of the terrorist behind theSan     Bernardino mass shooting , citing privacy concerns.;Putting user privacy first gives Apple a continuing     competitive advantage, even as other companies garner headlines     around their AI breakthroughs.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

The CPU was responsible for running the computer, including its operating system. When a GPU was installed, the CPU was still primary, but it farmed off graphics-intensive tasks to the GPU. Most PCs used integrated graphics that were built into their Intel CPU. Graphics cards from companies like Nvidia - with a standalone GPU - were primarily used in specialized gaming PCs.;It helps to think of the CPU as a generalist, while the GPU does one thing over and over. This difference began really turning to the advantage of NVDA about a decade ago.;10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to America;Desktop PC CPUs from Intel might have four cores, letting the CPU manage a handful of different tasks simultaneously. GPUs were equipped with hundreds of cores, and software developers realized they could take advantage of this raw parallel processing power for much more than just graphics. The GPU could be used to greatly accelerate software performance when repetitive tasks are being performed - encoding video, for example, or data analysis.;GPU acceleration can make some tasks 100 times faster;than a CPU alone.;Because the GPU is designed for one primary purpose - everything including computer graphics boils down to crunching numbers - NVDA is able to produce them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equivalent performance level, while producing less heat and using less power.;Why GPUs Are in Higher Demand Than CPUs;Why the demand for GPUs?;"Think of how the demand for processor-intensive computing power has increased over the past decade. One early example was Bitcoin. The virtual currency could be purchased, but it could also be ""mined"" by using a PC to run a complex algorithm in search of Bitcoins. Miners soon discovered that a GPU - with its parallel number-crunching capability - was far more effective than a CPU at mining Bitcoins.";Anywhere from 50 to 100 times faster;. Soon miners were running rigs consisting of multiple GPUs connected together.;Meantime, GPUs have rapidly become more powerful, with more cores and faster clock rates, even as CPU development has become relatively incremental.;Intel's new seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU for desktop computers still has four cores. In comparison, Nvidia's latest;Titan X graphics card;has 3,584 processing cores on tap. The Intel CPU costs less than a third of the Titan X's $1200 MSRP, but when used in number-crunching applications, the Nvidia card's price is a steal.;The technology that has the big potential for future growth involves;extreme;number crunching. Think virtual reality, the hottest trend in gaming. Cloud services - which are often a single, processor-intensive task like image recognition offloaded to the web. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining and deep data - these all require incredible processing power. Computers running INTC CPUs are too expensive and too general purpose to be running these tasks. Instead, you're more likely to find server farms powered by GPUs.;NVDA has also integrated its powerful GPUs into the forefront of one of the technology holy grails: self-driving cars.;Nvidia Drive PX2;is the company's AI car computing platform. With two GPUs providing the horsepower, NVDA says it is capable of 34 trillion deep learning operations per second. Additional units can be run in parallel for fully autonomous driving. Nvidia has already;partnered with multiple high-profile automakers;to equip their self-driving cars with its technology, including;BMW;,;Volvo;and;Tesla Motors Inc;(NASDAQ:;TSLA;);Growing Importance of the GPU Reflected in NVDA Stock;You can track the relative trajectories in INTC and NVDA by comparing their stock prices. Over the past five years, Intel has grown in value by a little more than 40%. That's not bad, but doesn't look quite so good when you compare it to the height of PC popularity. Since 2000, when PC sales were notching;14.5% annual sales growth;, Intel stock has actually dropped by 10%.;3 Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy Now (NVDA, ISIL, STM);In comparison, Nvidia stock is up by a whopping 650% in the past five years, and nearly 2,600% since 2000.;Intel Isn't Going Anywhere, But the Age of NVIDIA Has Arrived;Computer sales continue their slow slide,;down another 5.7% in 2016;. Much of Intel's revenue is tied to the PC market. Nvidia is not immune to the effect of declining PC sales, either.;But while INTC is trying to tie its future to technology like the Internet of Things (which is struggling with security issues and competing standards), NVDA has leveraged the massive parallel processing power of its GPUs to be a leader in multiple cutting-edge areas like AI, deep data, virtual reality and autonomous vehicles.;Increasingly, it's looking like we're entering the age of Nvidia. NVDA stock reflects that reality.;As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;"10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017";3 Things Apple Inc.

Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in India;January 25, 2017, 11:01:00 AM EDT;On Wednesday,;Apple;AAPL;executives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.;Like many tech corporations-think Amazon;AMZN;and Netflix;NFLX;-Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.;"""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""";The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on by;Times of India;. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.;According to;CNNMoney;, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country. However, Apple's products are not cheap, and most of India's 1.3 billion people have an average annual income of $1,500.;Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017;In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?;Who wouldn't?

Here’s Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75;January 25, 2017, 11:00:27 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;It's no longer the mid-1990's, but if you've blinked, you might have missed how quickly;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) transformed from a slow-moving bellwether to fast-growing tech company again.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Johannes Marliem Via Flickr;And this time, Windows and Office - while still huge money makers for the company - are not the products doing the heavy lifting. And that;bodes well;for MSFT stock.;The Nadella Effect;New CEO Satya Nadella deserves much of the credit for the turnaround in Microsoft and MSFT stock. Since Nadella was was appointed as CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, Microsoft shares have skyrocketed as much as 75%, when factoring its 52-week high of $64.10 reached on Dec. 23.;That comes out to 25% annual returns. And for a number of catalysts currently in play, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering some 25% returns.;Not only has the market rewarded Nadella for moving Microsoft toward high-growth areas such as the cloud with Office 365 and the company's dominant Azure platform, Nadella has - in the process - made investors forget Microsoft's failures under former CEO Steve Ballmer. Notably, missing out on mobile and being surpassed by the likes of;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) and;Samsung Electronics;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;).;10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains;But thanks to Nadella's strong pulse on the company, Microsoft won't miss out on anymore opportunities.;The M&A Effect;Take, for example, last week's;acquisition of Simplygon;", a company that develops 3D-optimization solutions for video game developers and other industries that need to visualize 3D data. Microsoft didn't reveal how much it paid for Simplygon, not that its price is important. What matters is the extent to which this deal can help Microsoft leverage its existing ""3D to everyone"" initiative, which makes it easy to capture, create and share in 3D images.";The deal for Simplygon follows last Friday's deal for artificial intelligence (AI) startup;Maluuba;, which specializes in deep learning and reinforcement learning. And to say nothing about its $26.2 billion blockbuster deal for LinkedIn Corp, which closed in December.;With almost $140 billion in cash on its balance sheet, there's not much Microsoft can't afford. And Satya seems determined to deploy the company's cash to ensure Microsoft's growth never peaks.;Bottom Line on MSFT Stock;Microsoft stock - currently priced at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 19 - deserves a higher multiple. With growth opportunities emerging in the realm of Internet of Things, smart homes, the cloud and now 3D and AI, MSFT stock - despite trading near all-time highs - still looks attractive.;The LinkedIn deal, which exposes Microsoft to a new set of growth areas such as advertising, putting it in the realm of;Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;), deserves an additional three to four points above Microsoft's current P/E.;Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings Preview;Looking out to the next 12 to 18 months, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75, when assigning a P/E of 23 (compared to Facebook's 24) to fiscal 2017 estimates of the $3.27 per share.;Aside from delivering 10% earnings growth in 2017, MSFT stock pays a 2.5% dividend yield, making it one of the better bargains in tech.;As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold any a position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;Can the Shark Tank Make These 3 Canadian Stocks Great Again?;The 3 Best Under-the-Radar Trump Stocks to Buy;The post;Here's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.
Why Apple Inc. Stock (AAPL) Was Downgraded Ahead Of Earnings;January 25, 2017, 10:45:01 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Apple Inc.;(;AAPL;) stock was little changed in early trading on Tuesday before rallying in Wednesday morning trading following a rare downgrade from analysts at;Barclays;.;"makeArticleAd();";The iPhone maker is scheduled to release its next earnings report on Jan. 31, and the story on Wall Street is weak iPhone 7 sales.;Still, some are finding cause to remain positive as consumers seem to be favoring the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, which of course is a good thing for the average selling price. Barclays' downgrade follows a;price target increase;last week.;Apple Stock Downgraded;In a research note Tuesday morning, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz went so far as to say that he doesn't see any big catalysts for Apple stock for the next 12 months. This implies that he's not even sure that the iPhone 8 will move the needle on sales enough to boost investor confidence, at least in the early days. Twelve months will bring us past the launch of this year's iPhone models.;"The analyst downgraded Apple stock from ""Overweight";"""";"to ""Equal-weight";"""";and trimmed his price target by $2 to $117 per share.;Part of Moskowitz's newfound bearishness on Apple stock is less company-specific and more about the decelerating smartphone sales being felt across the industry.;10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second Wind;Looking out to the long term, however, he feels that the stickiness of the iPhone maker's ecosystem, big cash stash and tenth anniversary iPhone (widely expected to be;the iPhone 8;) will serve as a support for investors.;Here's how two additional analysts view the future prospects for AAPL stock…;Buy AAPL On a Pullback;Pacific Crest;"analyst Andy Hargreaves said on Monday that investors should think about buying Apple stock on a ""meaningful pullback."" Although he thinks December quarter sales might be in line with consensus, he warned that March quarter sales could decline on the back of the iPhone's weakest sell-through data ever.";"However, he maintained his ""Overweight";"""";rating and $127 price target on Apple stock.;UBS;analyst Steven Milunovich also has $127 price target paired with a Buy rating on Apple stock, and he said in a note dated Jan. 24 that the CIRP survey suggests a mix shift toward the iPhone 7 Plus and models with more storage in the U.S., both of which are good for the average selling price.;The survey indicated that 42% of iPhone sales were the Plus models, a much greater percentage than last year's 26%. Sixty-two percent of buyers favored the $100 or $200 step-ups in storage, and Android switchers remained stable even as the upgrade rate was strong.;Milunovich is concerned about China and currency headwinds even though he still looks for iPhone growth in the double digits for fiscal 2018. He expects continued declines in China.;Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings Preview;Further, the higher bill of materials for the iPhone 7 lineup could offset the mix shift toward more expensive models, pressuring the gross margin.;The UBS analyst is roughly in line with consensus on Apple's;December quarter earnings;.

Alternative Facts? Apple, Inc. Gets a Strange Downgrade;January 25, 2017, 10:40:00 AM EDT;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares sat out of the stock market rally on   Tuesday, largely because of a downgrade from;Barclays;. Analyst Mark Moskowitz expects the smartphone market to   stagnate this year. Moreover, unlike many other analysts, he   doesn't see the upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone as a major   growth catalyst.;Indeed, Moskowitz asserts that iPhone buyers are increasingly   opting to buy older models like the iPhone 6s in order to save   $100, rather than paying up for Apple's latest and greatest   designs. If consumers are becoming more focused on price than   design, they might not care that much about the major design   changes expected in the next-generation iPhone.;"makeArticleAd();";Are consumers still willing to pay up for the priciest iPhones   or are they trading down? Image source: Apple.;However, there is very little evidence that iPhone buyers are   actually trading down. As a result, investors shouldn't pay much   attention to Moskowitz's bearish prognostications.;Customers haven't been trading down;iPhone users weren't trading down in a meaningful way during   the first half of fiscal 2016. In Q1 -- the all-important holiday   quarter -- Apple's average selling price (ASP) for the iPhone   rose slightly year over year, despite a 6% to 7% headwind from   the strengthening dollar. The increase in ASPs was boosted by a   growing preference for pricier iPhones with larger screens and   more storage. Still, the data aren't consistent with a big shift   toward buying older models.;During Q2, the iPhone ASP slipped about 2.5% year over year,   but it still likely rose on a currency-neutral basis.   Furthermore, Apple faced a tough comparison that quarter because   it had been catching up from an iPhone 6 Plus supply shortage a   year earlier.;The iPhone 6s sold quite well considering that it was only a     minor upgrade of the iPhone 6. Image source: Apple.;The iPhone ASP did fall 10% and 8% on a year-over-year basis   in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. That provides   some evidence of customers trading down. However, much of the   decline was again caused by the strong dollar. Furthermore, the   budget-priced iPhone SE launched early in Q3 last year. Thus, for   most of the second half of fiscal 2016, Apple's newest iPhone was   also its cheapest iPhone. This obviously weighed on ASPs.;iPhone unit sales did decline last year, perhaps due to   perceptions that the iPhone 6s wasn't a big upgrade over the   iPhone 6. Nevertheless, considering all of the evidence, it   appears that those consumers who did buy an iPhone during Apple's   fiscal 2016 continued to favor the newest models.;Apple's iPhone mix probably improved last quarter;We won't know for sure whether the iPhone ASP increased or   decreased last quarter until Apple reports its Q1 earnings next   week. However, the preliminary evidence derived from iPhone usage   data points toward a solid increase.;First, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus currently account for   about 14.5% of total iPhone usage,;according to Fiksu;. That's exactly in line with the usage share of the iPhone 6s   and iPhone 6s Plus a year ago. Given that the iPhone user base is   probably still expanding at a double-digit annual rate, an equal   usage share implies higher unit sales.;Mixpanel, another company that tracks iPhone usage -- but with   more U.S.-centric data -- shows an even bigger sales uptick for   the latest iPhones compared to last year's models.;"Second, the popularity of the pricier ""Plus"" models continues   to grow, even after Apple hiked its prices for the iPhone 7 Plus   lineup by $20. (Demand was so strong that the iPhone 7 Plus was   in";short supply;for most of last quarter.) The iPhone 7 Plus had a usage share of   4.4% at the end of Q1, compared to 3.4% for the iPhone 6s Plus a   year earlier.;Demand for the iPhone 7 Plus has been red-hot. Image source:   Apple.;Partially offsetting this, the dollar has continued to rise   against some key foreign currencies (mainly the British pound and   Chinese yuan). But that just means that even a small ASP increase   would indicate significant year-over-year improvement in the   iPhone product mix.;Are expectations too low?;Since bottoming out around $90 in May, Apple's stock price has   shot up by 34%. This suggests that investors are starting to   become more optimistic about the company's prospects.;Nevertheless, many Wall Street analysts still have very low   expectations. In fact, analysts expect Apple to report a   year-over-year EPS decline next week, despite the positive iPhone   usage data and strong growth in Apple's services business.;If Apple is able to beat the estimates by reporting modest   earnings growth for Q1 and offering a solid outlook for Q2,   shares of the tech giant could begin 2017 with another rally.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Q4 Earnings Strengthen Tech ETFs Further?;January 25, 2017, 09:52:00 AM EDT;After earnings releases from most of the major financial companies, the tech sector is now taking center stage. Most of the ace tech players are lined up to report this and next week. Investors should note that a rising rate environment, improving industry fundamentals, ongoing consolidations, and emerging technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous cars are benefiting the sector, pushing the stocks and ETFs to record highs this year.;"makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');";In fact, four popular ETFs -;Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF;XLK;,;Vanguard Information Technology ETF;VGT;,;iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF;IYW;and;MSCI Information Technology Index ETF;FTEC;- are up more than 3% each so far this year.

The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revision of eight cents over the past 90 days for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an;Earnings ESP;of -0.31%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates this quarter.

Apple Earnings Strategy: When To Buy AAPL Shares;January 25, 2017, 09:42:45 AM EDT;Apple will release earnings soon (Shutterstock photo);Apple (;AAPL;) will release their earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 next Tuesday, and the guessing game has begun. It used to be that analysts would wait until they had seen the numbers before opining or changing any rating on Apple stock. In part that was because up until last year, the company continually made those analysts look foolish by beating every quarter’s estimates by huge margins.;That meant that investors who bought the stock in the run up to earnings invariably benefited, and analysts would rush to upgrade forecasts once the extent of the beat was known. However, the recent slowdown in growth has changed the dynamic somewhat.;"makeArticleAd();";Now it seems that the competition among those that cover AAPL is to see who can come out with the gloomiest earnings prediction, and who can downgrade the earliest. Over the past week two big names, Barclays and Stifel have downgraded AAPL in front of earnings, both citing worries about i-Phone 7 sales.;This kind of focus on potential and actual negatives surrounding Apple’s earnings has changed the way retail investors should approach the release too. With such negativity abounding the stock is likely to lose ground as earnings approach, and/or to react to anything but a spectacular report in a negative, or at best muted, manner.;"Far from buying in front of the release, then, waiting until afterwards makes sense this time around. That assumes that buying AAPL at all would be a good idea; an assumption not everybody will be comfortable with. The negative slant to coverage that makes it likely that you will be able to pick up AAPL cheap next week will also put off some people, but a look at the facts and prospects should reassure you.";First, let’s look at the stock’s actual performance. If you listen to the naysayers they would have you believe that AAPL has underperformed recently. The reality, though, as demonstrated by the chart below comparing AAPL to the Nasdaq tracking ETF,;QQQ;over the last six months, is completely different. During that time AAPL has outperformed its benchmark by a factor of 3, gaining 24% compared to the index’s 8%.;Appreciation in AAPL though, as with any stock, is about what will happen in the future rather than what has happened in the past, but there are a few reasons to be optimistic on that front too. As I wrote;a few weeks ago;, my personal experience suggests that demand for the Apple Watch series 2 is greater than anybody expected, with a fair amount of pent up demand resulting from widespread shortages of the product in the holiday buying season.;In addition, even those anticipating lower than expected iPhone sales have noted that the higher priced 7 Plus has proven more popular than expected, which should benefit the bottom line.;All of that is positive, but what investors are really looking for is for Apple to do something spectacular again in order to re-invigorate the whole ecosystem. Their recent decision to start commissioning original content for Apple TV offers the possibility of that. Content production is, of course, a very crowded field right now, and a difficult business at the best of times, but Apple has a huge advantage over others that might try to break into the market: over $200 billion in cash.;As Netflix (;NFLX;) and Amazon (;AMZN;) have shown, it only takes one or two hits to be successful in this area and with the ability to absorb a few failures, betting against Apple succeeding would seem to be foolish.;Add in a decent and growing dividend and buying or adding to holdings of AAPL is a good idea. With that said, though, the fact that the conventional wisdom seems to be that this will be a disappointing earnings release for the company makes patience in this case a virtue, and waiting until after next Tuesday’s report is a risk that should pay off.
If I Could Buy Only 1 Stock, This Would Be It;January 25, 2017, 09:40:00 AM EDT;Image source: Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";If I could only buy one stock right now, then there are a few   boxes that stock needs to check. I'd like the holding to be   relatively safe in a tumultuous time but still look likely to   generate modest short-term growth, while having the potential for   exceptional long-term growth. I also want the stock to have a   robust balance sheet and be relatively cheap in this expensive   market -- and is a little dividend too much to ask?;For all of that, look no further than;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) .;Short-term growth prospects look good;Apple's finances are massive in almost every way, with sales   in the fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24 of $47 billion. Sales and   earnings actually slowed during the during quarter, down 9% and   19%, respectively, but the company has guided for a return to   sales growth in fiscal Q1.;Some Apple bears have pointed to the company's reliance on its   iPhone -- which made up about two-thirds of sales in the most   recent quarter -- and that those sales are starting to slow as   the phone seems to be saturating the addressable market. The   average selling price (ASP) of the iPhone segment has fallen   slightly year over year.;However, the iPhone could have plenty of growth left. The new   iPhone 7 launched in late 2016 seems to be performing very well   already and should help to boost ASP once again. Additionally,   the issues with the exploding;Samsung;Galaxy Note 7, which has even been banned on all U.S.   aircraft, could help to make 2017 iPhone sales the highest   yet.;Image source: Apple.;The bears also point to nascent growth in most of Apple's   other products, such as its personal computers, iPads, and the   Apple Watch. One other area that's growing impressively is the   services segment, which includes revenue from services such as   iTunes, iCloud, and Apple Pay. This segment's revenue grew 24%   year over year to $6.3 billion in the fiscal year, making up 13%   of total revenue as Apple's second largest segment by sales   behind the iPhone segment. Services are increasingly important,   as the total number of Apple products in use continues to grow   each quarter, meaning more devices that are likely linked to an   Apple account and could help services revenue to continue growing   nicely.;Apple's robust financial position;While Apple's sales and earnings have come under pressure, its   cash growth has not. Apple's operating cash flow in the most   recent quarter surged to $16 billion, a new company record for   that time period. With so much excess cash flow, the company   has grown its total cash and investments to $238 billion, more   than a third of its market cap, and about;double the next wealthiest company in the United   States.;Unfortunately for Apple's capital expenditure advocates, about   90% of that money is stored out of the U.S., as the company has   resisted paying heavy repatriation taxes to bring it back home.   However, President Trump has signaled that he'd like to offer a   much lower tax rate, maybe as low as 10%, for companies in   Apple's position that are seeking to send huge chunks of money   home. There are certainly other risks for Apple in some of   Trump's proposed tax ideas, such as potential import tariffs on   goods manufactured overseas, but this one point is important for   what it could mean for Apple's cash available for immediate   use.;Long-term growth potential;"Apple's new wireless headphones, called ""air pods."" Image     source: Apple.";Apple's modest short-term growth on continued incremental   innovations and execution is encouraging, but it's much more fun   to consider Apple's moonshot long-term growth possibilities.   Apple increased its research and development spend by about 25%   to $10 billion in fiscal 2016.;Speaking of the company's huge cash position, there are a few   fun reckless predictions we can make about what the company might   spend that money on developing. Self-driving cars, virtual   and augmented reality, and more recently original content for   iTunes are all areas of growth that tech industry analysts are   looking for from Apple.;My favorite reckless prediction is that Apple will begin   competing more heavily in artificial intelligence. Apple's Siri   was one of the first voice-based search tools before;Amazon.com;(NASDAQ: AMZN) and;Google;(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) entered the space with their smart   home voice-activated devices.;Amazon and Google beat Apple to market with their home   assistant devices, but Apple isn't known for being an early   market mover -- rather, Apple has a knack for swooping in with   amazing products that in turn dominate the market that's already   there. Let's not forget that Amazon and Google have ventured into   Apple's world with their consumer electronics much more than   Apple would be venturing into theirs with its own artificial   intelligence assistant.;Why;Apple stock;still looks like a great buy;Finally, in terms of valuation, Apple still looks cheap. Even   though the stock is up 20% over the past six months, it's still   trading at just 14 times earnings. Compare that with around 25   times earnings on average for the S&P 500, Google at 30, and   Amazon at 185. Also, Apple stock has run up quickly lately, but   it's still down from its high of around $135 in mid-2015, so its   recent run doesn't look unreasonable.;Add to that a relatively cheap valuation, as well as all of   the points covered here, that Apple stock also pays a 2% dividend   yield, which could very well rise as Apple deploys more of its   huge cash load in 2017. The best investment strategy is one   that's well diversified, but for all of those points -- if I   could only buy one stock, Apple continues to look like a great   stock to buy and hold as a core long-term position.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for   over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

That backed out items related   to properties in Suriname and western Australia.;However, revenues of $2.54 billion were enough to beat   estimates for $2.54 billion.

(AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX);January 25, 2017, 09:09:58 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;U.S. stock futures are in rally mode this morning, as   corporate earnings continue to bolster sentiment on Wall Street.   What's more, the;Dow Jones Industrial Average;could be poised to challenge the 20,000 level today, especially   if earnings from blue-chip members;United Technologies Corporation;(NYSE:;UTX;) and;Boeing Co;(NYSE:;BA;) come in strong this morning.;Against this backdrop, futures on the;Dow Jones Industrial Average;have added 0.33%, with;S&P 500;futures up 0.32% and;Nasdaq-100;futures rallying 0.43%.;"makeArticleAd();";On the options front, Tuesday's volume came back strong from   Monday's lackluster performance. Overall, the roughly 17.5   million calls and 14.8 million puts traded put a bullish spin on   the day's activity. Bullish activity wasn't quite as pronounced   on the CBOE, however, as the single-session equity put/call   volume ratio dipped slightly to 0.65. The 10-day moving average   banked its fifth session in a row at 0.65.;Turning to Tuesday's volume leaders,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;") remained pinned to the $120 region after Barclays downgraded   the shares on excessive hype surrounding the iPhone 8   ""supercycle."" Meanwhile,";Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;) continues to see call volume come in light heading into next   week's earnings report, and;Freeport-McMoRan Inc;(NYSE:;FCX;) and other miners attracted a sizable bullish bid after   President Trump signed several executive orders to help increase   infrastructure spending.;Apple Inc.

Call option volume had been trending in   the 66th to 67th percentile of daily total volume, but managed to   only garner 60% of the more than 498,000 contracts traded   yesterday.;Still, this one blip hasn't been enough to shake overall   sentiment on AAPL, with the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio   falling over the past couple of weeks to rest at 0.76. The   current upside earnings target in the 3 Feb series remains $120   with 19,000 contracts, though the $125 has amassed more than   10,000 contracts, and OI is rising.;Facebook Inc (FB);FB stock is also garnering quite the earnings bid from   speculative options traders. Facebook stock saw option volume   jump to 484,000 contracts on Tuesday, with calls making up a   below-average 58% of the day's take. Surprisingly, puts are in   considerable demand for FB stock ahead of earnings, with the 3   Feb put/call OI ratio rising in recent weeks to 0.93 - placing   puts and calls in near parity.;On the upside, FB stock options traders are eyeballing the   $130 strike (6,500 contracts), though peak call OI for the series   totals nearly 10,000 contracts at the in-the-money $123 strike.   Implieds are pricing in a post-earnings move of about 5% for FB   stock.;By the numbers, Wall Street is expecting a profit of $1.30 per   share on revenue of $8.4 billion, though;EarningsWhispers.com;places the whisper number at $1.37 per share, hinting at elevated   expectations that may be giving options traders pause.;Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Takes a Hit From … Netflix, Inc.? (NFLX);January 25, 2017, 08:39:17 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;When;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) designed the iPhone and iOS mobile operating system, the company chose to exclude support for external storage. On the other hand, many smartphones running;Alphabet Inc's;(NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) Android operating system included the ability to supplement onboard storage using inexpensive SD memory cards. Not a game-changer, clearly.;Source: Twitter;But;Netflix, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;NFLX;) just made the difference a little more important, by adding support for Netflix downloads to SD cards on Android.;"makeArticleAd();";To SD or Not to SD;From the start, AAPL spurned the idea of giving iPhone (or iPad) users access to external storage. The company designed iOS to hide file directories from the user level - keeping the user interface extremely simple - and that meant not being able to choose whether to save a file in built-in storage, or in external storage.;Besides keeping the user interface clean and easier to support, the move also was a financial windfall for Apple. Without any option to boost storage, users who wanted more than the bare minimum would be forced to pay for the next tier in iPhones. So that $649 base model became $749.;AAPL's profit margin on that extra $100 was considerable, since the flash memory used for storage is inexpensive.;For point of comparison, going from 32GB to 128GB on the iPhone 7 is an extra $100, while a 128GB microSD card can be had for $50. And that's paying retail prices, which AAPL most certainly does not.;Google, on the other hand, supported the use of SD cards for external storage. It was limited at first, but by Android Marshmallow, Android users could use that extra storage for virtually anything, including apps. They could buy cheap, lower-capacity micro SD cards and swap them out at will.;10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to     America;This was a very popular feature, as;Samsung Electronics Co Ltd;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) discovered when it ditched the feature on the Galaxy S6. After the outcry, the capability;returned with the Galaxy S7;.;Netflix Downloads Makes SD Card Support a Bigger Deal;The announcement of Netflix downloads for iOS and Android was a very popular move. Watching video on a smartphone is popular, but cellular data isn't cheap.

The Tech Battle for the Classroom Is Heating Up;January 24, 2017, 09:39:00 PM EDT;Image source: Getty Images.;Alphabet;(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been making steady gains in   the classroom, thanks to the Chromebook. The search giant is   looking to maintain that momentum and has just announced two new   Chromebooks that are specifically designed for the educational   market. Google is also taking the opportunity to share a few data   points. There are now 20 million teachers and students using   Chromebooks and Google Classroom, and over 70 million people now   use G Suite for Education, the company's online productivity   suite that's tailored for educational purposes.;"makeArticleAd();";A tale of two new educational Chromebooks;The two new devices are the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 and the   ASUS Chromebook C213. Google says it collaborated with educators   to include features that would specifically help in the   classroom. Specifically, that includes stylus support for   students to draw and take notes. In order to keep costs down, the   styluses are cheap, don't need to be charged or paired, and are   easily replaced if lost. This move is clearly designed to broaden   appeal by offering something that tablets do.;In May 2016, Google said it was bringing Android apps to   Chrome OS. This was part of Google's broader strategy to merge   Chrome OS and Android. Administrators will be able to install   Android apps on educational Chromebooks, which is a big win   considering how much more educational content is available for   Android.;Microsoft wants in;Chromebooks and tablets have largely displaced low-cost;Microsoft;(NASDAQ: MSFT) PCs, but the software giant is fighting back.   Microsoft also just announced Intune for Education. Intune is the   company's mobile device management offering, which has   historically been catered to the enterprise. Intune for Education   will be a cloud-based application for device management, which   will allow administrators to manage a group of Windows 10 devices   in educational settings. Microsoft says this is one of two   critical pieces that it has been missing in the educational   market, with the other being affordable Windows 10 PCs.;Video source: Microsoft.;"Microsoft makes it clear that it's taking a direct shot at   Chromebooks, saying, ""New Windows 10 Devices Offer Great   Alternatives to Chromebooks."" The company is unveiling a slew of   new Windows 10 devices that are targeting education, from";HP;, Acer, and Lenovo.;Where's Apple?;A few years back,;Apple;"(NASDAQ: AAPL) tried to position the iPad as the ideal   educational computing device, but for the most part those   aspirations have fallen flat. Chromebooks are able to undercut   iPads by a significant margin, and the presence of an attached   keyboard is important for education and productivity. Many of the   Chromebooks and Windows PCs that are gaining traction in the   educational market are priced at just $150 to $300; the cheapest   iPad is the aging iPad Mini 2 that was launched in 2013 and   currently costs $269.";The educational market has long been important to Apple from a   philosophical perspective, if not a financial one. But prices   continue to fall, hindering Apple's ability to compete.   Importantly, 2-in-1 devices are expected to continue growing in   education, and Apple does not offer a full-fledged 2-in-1   product.;It looks like Microsoft and Google may end up winning the   battle for the classroom.;10 stocks we like better than Microsoft;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Problem With Apple's TV Ambitions;January 24, 2017, 07:49:00 PM EDT;Image Source: Motley Fool.;Apple;"(NASDAQ: AAPL) has toyed with the idea of entering the television   industry for what seems like ages now. Since it unveiled the   original Apple TV in 2007, the company has considered   manufacturing its own television set, putting together a ""skinny   bundle,"" and even, according to pundits, making an offer for a   company like";Netflix;(NASDAQ: NFLX) .;"makeArticleAd();";Apple has long had a foothold in music ever since it launched   iTunes, and television could bring the same complementary   benefits to its ecosystem. Apple already sells many of the   devices used to consume streaming video, and technology has   tipped the entertainment scales toward tech companies rather than   traditional media players. After Netflix, e-commerce giant;Amazon.com;(NASDAQ: AMZN) has made the biggest splash in streaming.;Now Apple wants to join the herd, producing its own original   shows. According to;The;Wall Street Journal;, the company has been in talks with producers to make its own   programming, which would be available to subscribers of its   $10/month music-streaming service. The company hopes to launch   such programming by the end of 2017.;However, while it seems natural for Apple to have ambitions in   TV, diving straight into original programming could present a   number of challenges for the company.;1. Profits are thin;"After years of breakneck international expansion, Netflix is   finally set to deliver its first year of ""material profits"" since   2011, when it split its streaming service from its DVD-by-mail   business after years of operating at breakeven. Amazon,   meanwhile, doesn't break out figures for its streaming service,   and essentially gives it away to its Prime members, using its   content as a carrot to entice more people to shop on its   website.";The point is that video streaming is no one's idea of a cash   cow at this point. The services are so cheap, at about $10/month,   that a company needs to generate a substantial base before hoping   to make a profit. Netflix, for example, is set to top 100 million   subscribers this year, but it took the company years to get to   that point. Apple could operate the service at a loss, but that   seems contrary to the company's high-margin business model. With   more than $45 billion in net income in its last fiscal year, it's   going to take more than a small video streaming service to move   the needle.;2. Where's the expertise?;Apple is a device-maker. Its brand and its profits come from   making hardware like the iPhone, iPad, and the Mac. Developing   and shopping for TV shows is outside of its core competencies,   and because iTunes has languished over the years, it lacks the   detailed data that competitors like Netflix have on customer   preferences.;Analysts dismissed Netflix's initial ambitions in original   programming, but the company's vast database guided it when it   chose to remake the British series;House of Cards;, as it recognized that its subscribers had a penchant for   political dramas and actor Kevin Spacey. That show would be the   first of several hit series for Netflix.;Amazon may have had to start more from scratch, though it had   its own a la carte streaming service before getting into   originals. That company's culture also prizes innovation,   risk-taking, and failure, and it launched its original   programming in 2013, giving it a significant head start over   Apple. Thanks to its Prime subscriber base, the company quickly   found an audience for its shows. In comparison, Apple under Tim   Cook seems more content to leverage its current assets and   products into new revenue streams rather than build fresh   ones.;If Apple wishes to give away original programming to its Apple   Music subscribers, it may be able to build viewership like Amazon   did. But Apple doesn't have the same interest in adding perks to   Apple Music the way Amazon does with Prime. Ultimately, the   company needs to find a way to grow profits, and original TV   seems unlikely to do that either directly or indirectly as its   impact on hardware sales would probably be limited.;Apple's track record in television so far also bodes poorly   for its ambitions, as the company seems unclear of its ultimate   goal and is unable to successfully negotiate with media partners.   With its hardware sales stalling, Apple has increasingly turned   to services like Apple Music or Apple Pay, but the relationship   between its devices and TV seems tenuous at best. Rather than   entering the increasingly competitive media environment, the   company would be better off leading with its strength, directly   investing in research and development that would advance hardware   sales or develop its next blockbuster product..;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Bad News for Apple: Plenty of People Think the iPhone 6s Is Good Enough;January 24, 2017, 06:48:00 PM EDT;The iPhone 7 didn't have a killer feature (no headphone jack   doesn't count). Image source: Apple.;It goes without saying that;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) singular goal with every year's iPhone upgrade   cycle is to provide just enough new features to coax legions of   its loyal fans into upgrading to the latest and greatest model --   ideally every single year. It's also clear that this has proven   increasingly difficult, as smartphones these days are so good   that it's hard to imagine the company releasing groundbreaking or   revolutionary features anymore.;"makeArticleAd();";Unfortunately, that may also be true of the most recent iPhone   7. Even personally, 2016 was the;first time in eight years;that I didn't upgrade to the newest model.;Word on the Street;Barclays;analyst Mark Moskowitz has just put out a research note (via;Tech Trader Daily;), downgrading shares from overweight to equal weight, which is   the equivalent of dropping his rating from buy to hold. The   analyst also reduced his price target by $2 to $117, which is   notably slightly below current prices.;Investors have seen plenty of signs that the smartphone market   has been weakening for a year or two, a trend that's not letting   up anytime soon. Moskowitz's research suggests that many   smartphone customers are increasingly picking 2015's iPhone 6s   instead of 2016's iPhone 7, the former of which costs $100 less.   Lacking any killer, must-have features, the new model simply   doesn't justify the $100 premium in many consumers' minds.;That's largely why Moskowitz has reduced his average selling   price (ASP) estimate from $650 to $648. That $2 difference may   not sound like a lot, but keep in mind we're talking about   roughly 220 million iPhone units that the analyst expects the   company to sell in 2017. A $2 difference in ASP translates into   $440 million less in revenue. For reference, Apple sold 211.9   million iPhones last fiscal year (which ended in September),   generating $136.7 billion in revenue, which translates into an   ASP of $645.;Smartphones are also seeing upgrade cycles elongate, as the   product category matures and people are keeping their phones for   longer and longer. Currently, most consumers keep their phones   from two to three years on average, but this could stretch to   three to four years, in Moskowitz's view. This same thing   happened remarkably fast in tablets, which is partially why the   iPad hit a speed bump a few years back that it has yet to recover   from, but now it's happening in Apple's most important   business.;Will 8 be great?;"Whether or not Apple has some game-changing innovation up its   sleeve for the iPhone 8 remains to be seen, but judging from the   leaks we've seen thus far, the presumed ""iPhone 8"" is unlikely to   have some type of revolutionary feature. Things like an OLED   display, wireless charging, or edge-to-edge display are welcome   improvements, but may not be able to spur the """;super cycle;""" that many analysts are expecting.";"Shareholders (myself included) should set their 2017   expectations to ""meh.""";10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Let's look at the   brands that have the strongest attachments for millennials and   why.;"makeArticleAd();";Total Return Price;data by;YCharts;.;Nintendo enjoys a resurgence. Image source:;Pixabay;.;5. Nintendo;(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) . Having grown up with Nintendo, millennials   have an emotional attachment to the company and its games. The   first of the millennials were just old enough to begin playing;Super Mario Brothers;when it launched in late 1985, and continued with fan favorites   like;Zelda;,;Final Fantasy;,;Tetris;, and;Pokemon;". Nintendo acknowledged those ties last year in a Father's Day   press release, saying, ""For dads today, especially the   millennials, Nintendo was a big part of their childhood.""";Not content to rest on its laurels, the company is enjoying a   resurgence with the popularity of;Pokemon Go;, its mobile augmented-reality game, which sends users on a   virtual scavenger hunt for its characters. In its most recent   quarter, Nintendo reported hardware sales that rose 19% over the   previous year, and reports indicate that the release of the   next-generation game is imminent.;Millennials just want their technology to work. Image     source: Author.;4. Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Most millennials would have just been entering   their earning years with the release of the iPhone in 2007. The   introduction of the iPod six years earlier and it's 80% market   share provided a perfect transition.;Research shows that, as a group, millennials are the most   dependent on their phones. Over 78% of millennials use their   phones more than two hours per day, 80% reach for their phones   first thing, and 87% report that their phones never leave their   sides.;Millennials have grown up with technology and expect it to   work, so dependability is important to them.;Reader's Digest;called iPhones the most trusted mobile phone brand for 2016. That   level of familiarity, coupled with reliability, breeds a certain   attachment.;Netflix and chill. Image source: Netflix.;3. Netflix;(NASDAQ: NFLX) . Netflix is becoming the new normal, and nowhere   is that more apparent than among millennials. As a group, this   demographic was born in the information age and is more tech   savvy than previous generations, so streaming Netflix is a   natural.;"In the decade since Netflix began streaming, it has been   embraced by the generation that now outnumbers baby boomers.   MBLM's Managing Partner Mario Natarelli said, ""We found that   escapist brands performed especially well -- mostly in the media   and entertainment industry -- due to...the need for distraction,   control and enjoyment."" Netflix and chill, baby. Netflix and   chill.";Placing web orders is a cinch. Image source: Amazon.;2. Amazon;(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Millennials grew up watching their parents order   items in the little smiley boxes, and now embrace it themselves.   Placing orders from a website, or on a mobile app, is a cinch for   this tech-comfortable bunch. Previous studies have shown   millennials view Amazon as their most relevant brand, as   well. It applies as an escapist play in the same manner as   Netflix, via its Prime streaming service.;Millennials' social networking proclivities play a part, as   they share their product opinions, and solicit the views of   others. This plays directly to Amazon's DNA of customer reviews.   As consumers, millennials also collaborate with the brands they   connect with, and according to studies, they believe that   Amazon has the best customer service.;The Happiest Place on Earth! Image source: Author.;1. Disney;(NYSE: DIS) . As much as any other company on the list, Disney   taps into the nostalgia of millennials, while remaining a part of   their present. From the young stars on the Disney channel to some   of millenials' comic book favorites coming to life on the big   screen, Disney has always been there.;"According to Mario Natarelli, MBLM's managing partner, ""Disney   resonates with this age group because they grew up with the   brand. It has kept up with their changing interests and now   includes popular franchises like";Star Wars;"and Marvel... Disney is also a mainstay for young families.""";Millennials, as a group, feel strongly about their values, as   well as the companies they interact with. Walt Disney was known   for his strong sense of family values, and that affinity toward   his customers still permeates the company he founded.;Each of these companies has succeeded at creating an emotional   connection with its customers, in general, and the millennial   generation, in particular. This research shows that strong   positive feelings from consumers can be one factor supporting   strong company results and better stock performance.

Is Customer Satisfaction the Hidden Key to Stock Outperformance?;January 24, 2017, 04:12:00 PM EDT;As consumers, we have all been frustrated by companies which did not meet our expectations. Either poor service or a low quality product, the end result was always the desire to do less business with the given company.;However, on the other side of the coin, there are those companies out there that go above and beyond, time and time again. Those are the companies I like to frequent, and I have always wondered if these types of firms-which have a long history of satisfying their customers-end up making better investments too.;Well, in this edition of;the Dutram Report;, I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist of ACSI Funds, for some insights into this topic and if this idea works as an investment.;Inside ACSI;Kevin is an expert in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a benchmark that exists to find companies that customers either like, or would rather avoid. This is done by looking at a few key areas of the customer satisfaction process, including customer expectations, perceived value, and perceived quality.;This data has proven to be extremely popular with companies, as it helps them to keep tabs on the competition and to see their relative standing among their peers too. But the data can also be used to shape the outlook for companies and to see how they are trending in terms of customer satisfaction, which can help to show which companies are moving in the right direction.;ACSI's idea is that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty, which leads to additional consumer spending which ultimately leads to long-term stock appreciation. This intuitively makes sense, and now there is a way to use this strategy in ETF form.;The ETF;This is via ACSI Funds' American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (ACSI). This product holds securities that have high ACSI customer satisfaction scores, with the theory being that these will outperform their low-satisfaction peers.;Current holdings include well-respected names like Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Alphabet (GOOG) just to name a few, though there are dozens of names in the portfolio. And if you are wondering what is done for sectors where customer satisfaction levels aren't as readily available, such as energy or materials, big ETFs-such as XLE or XLB-are utilized in order to give more market-like exposure.;Bottom Line;For a more in-depth look at this index as well as its investable counterpart, make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information. We highlight some of the strengths and potential pitfalls when it comes to this strategy, and how it might fit into a portfolio too.;So, make sure to listen to this edition of;the Dutram Report;for a closer look at this novel segment of the equity world for some one-of-a-kind insights into this market, and the potential for investors to exploit this simple idea for their portfolios.

Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings Preview: Pixel & Home Could Fuel Growth;January 24, 2017, 04:05:00 PM EDT;As per usual, all eyes will be on the company formerly known as Google, Alphabet Inc.;GOOGL;, as the tech giant prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company rolled out its new Google Pixel phone and ushered in a new era of hardware-software interaction during the quarter, making this week's announcement even more important than usual.;In fact, the Google Pixel will most likely be the most compelling aspect of Alphabet's latest report, and investors will be clamoring to know how the device sold. It will also be interesting to see what the company says about its Google Home Controller, which also launched in the U.S. this quarter.;The Google Pixel is important because it is Alphabet's first high-end smartphone entirely produced in-house and represents a significant challenge to Apple's;AAPL;"iPhone line. The Google Home tells another story of competition; the ""Internet of Things"" in-home hub is one of the only competitors to Amazon's";AMZN;Echo speaker.;More importantly, both of these products underscore Alphabet's efforts to usher in its intelligent personal assistant software, Google Assistant. With similar functions to Apple's Siri and Microsoft's;MSFT;Cortana, Google Assistant is the backbone of the Pixel and Home devices and promises to be the foundation for all of Google's original products heading forward.;"Also, investors should not forget about the other products that Google launched in the quarter, all of which were officially unveiled at the same event in October. The company debuted its stylish headset for the Daydream VR platform, the ""Daydream View,"" as well as its first router, ""Google Wifi,"" and a Chromecast update, ""Chromecast Ultra.""";All of these products are important pieces of Google's effort to create a complete line of products that work together and with the new Google Assistant software. This is just the first quarter of sales, but it is also the holiday quarter and should give us a good idea of whether or not these products are resonating with shoppers.;"Heading into the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision over the past week. Our current consensus estimates indicate EPS growth of 8.40% and sales growth of 18.75%, and this has helped earn the company an ""A"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already. Overall, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.";Nevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.;Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017;In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?;Who wouldn't?

Why 2017 Will Be the Year of the Virtual Assistant;January 24, 2017, 03:32:00 PM EDT;In its annual mobile apps survey, Research firm Gartner   predicted that by 2019 virtual assistants will account for;20% of all smartphone interactions;. With that level of user engagement,  predictably all of   the largest technology companies are invested in the segment and   each brings a different strength to the field.;Will 2017 be the year of the virtual assistant?  Image   source: Pixabay.;"makeArticleAd();";Amazon Echo powered by Alexa. Image source: Amazon.com.;Amazon;Many media reports  are calling;Amazon;'s(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa the hit of the Consumer Electronics Show.    In 2015, Amazon made a skills kit available to developers   that allowed partners to incorporate voice commands. Fast forward   to 2017 and Alexa can integrate with an estimated 5,000   third-party apps,  from refrigerators to TV's, from cars to   vacuums, and lest we forget, the Echo smart home speaker.    The novelty of this device made it among the top selling   items on Amazon's website during the holidays. This was a   brilliant strategic move by a company without a smartphone as an   installed base. Amazon does, however, have a roster of well-known   companies in its corner including Ford, Samsung and LG to name a   few. In addition to product integration, Alexa can be found in a   dizzying number of bots that can order a pizza from Domino's,   schedule an Uber, or check your Capital One balance. This gives   Amazon the early lead in terms of reach and momentum, but the   lack of a mobile device means that challenges remain.;Apple's Siri. Image source: Apple.;Apple;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) , represented in the category by Siri, hasn't seen   much love. Her earliest incarnation could only answer correctly   about 65% of the time,  and users complained that far too   often she defaulted to Google rather than answering the question.   Consumers tend to remember those early first experiences, and   Siri still has a bad reputation. She shouldn't be counted out   yet, though. Apple has been taking steps to improve Siri's   understanding. In mid-2014, Siri's brain was replaced by an   artificial intelligence (AI) based neural network and Apple   claims that Siri now has a less than 5% error rate. Apple argues   that it isn't necessary to upload all of your data to the cloud   in order for Siri to improve. It uses a technique called   differential privacy, which keeps individual information at the   local phone level and protects user privacy.  Though it   currently doesn't have a, Echo-like voice-activated speaker,;reports indicate;that a prototype is currently in the testing stage.;Google Home powered by Google Assistant. Image source:     Google.;Alphabet;Alphabet;'s(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has introduced Google   Assistant, which expands on the capabilities of Google Now and OK   Google. This assistant is currently available on its Pixel phones   and can be accessed on other smartphones via the Google Allo app.   This virtual helper is more conversational and has produced   impressive early results due to experiences gained from its   predecessors. It was found to rival and in many cases surpass its   nearest competitors. Assistant's greatest strength may be the   ability to answer follow-up questions, a feature many of its   rivals lack. Integration with Google Home smart speaker puts it   squarely in competition with Amazon's Echo. Its strengths include   entire home synchronized audio and grouping of smart-home   commands.;Some researchers;believe that Alexa will cede its early lead in the category to   Google Assistant by 2020.;Microsoft Cortana. Image source: Microsoft.;Microsoft;Microsoft;'s(NASDAQ: MSFT) Cortana is available across its Windows 10-based   devices including phones, tablets and PC's. It has many competing   features, but has exhibited difficulties responding to requests,   reminiscent of Siri's early days. Microsoft announced late last   year that it would open Cortana to third party integration, so   expect a number of hardware integrations on the horizon. It has   yet to introduce an interactive speaker, but its first hardware   partner is Harman Kardon and one is expected sometime this year.    In a shrewd move, the kit used by developers is remarkably   similar to that of Alexa, allowing them to piggyback off the work   they have already done. This will accelerate the process of   producing hardware that will integrate Cortana.;Near-ubiquitous technology;Those interested in a task-based comparison between the four   might find;this article;by;Business Insider;of interest. Despite the varying capabilities among these   entries, one thing is clear: nearly every person with a computer,   tablet, smartphone, or home speaker system will have access to a   virtual personal assistant in the coming year. With this level of   exposure, consumers will begin to adopt these virtual assistants,   and as the technology becomes more advanced, providers will find   new, more innovative ways to incorporate them into our everyday   lives. Society is still in the early stages of the adoption cycle   for these digital helpers, but it appears that this year is the   tipping point.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Reviewing Samsung's Q4 2016 Figures And What Lies Ahead;January 24, 2017, 02:06:56 PM EDT;Samsung Electronics (;SSNLF;) published its Q4 2016 results on Tuesday, posting its highest operating profit in over three years, as a strong market for semiconductor products and the depreciation of the Korean Won helped the company overcome some setbacks faced by its smartphone division, following the discontinuation of its fire-prone Note 7 smartphones in Q3. While overall revenues remained almost flat at;53.33 trillion won ($45.8 billion);, operating profits expanded by about 50% to 9.22 trillion won ($7.9 billion). Samsung expects earnings to improve in 2017, as the company takes advantage of strong semiconductor pricing and stable demand, although the smartphone unit could face some challenges, amid higher marketing costs, slowing global smartphone shipment growth and mounting competition. Below we take a look at some of the key factors that drove Samsung's performance over the last quarter and what to expect in 2017.;We have a;$1,340 price estimate for Samsung Electronics;, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.;See our complete analysis for Samsung;"makeArticleAd();";Semiconductor;Unit Outperforms On Tight Supply And Samsung's High-End Focus;Samsung's semiconductor business had a solid quarter, with revenues rising by 12.5% to 14.86 trillion won ($12.74 billion), and operating profits growing by about 77% to a record 4.95 trillion won ($4.24 billion), driven largely by the memory business. Supply-demand conditions in the memory market have been tight, with mobile OEMs increasing memory content on devices, effectively bolstering demand for NAND modules, while PC DRAM is seeing some under-supply, as major vendors have been reducing their production mix in favor of mobile DRAM, boosting prices. While Samsung has been benefiting from the broader market tailwinds, the company's technology edge and its focus on higher value products also appear to be paying off.;For instance, Samsung is focusing on high density/performance DRAM over commodity DRAM, while expanding process migration to the 48-layer 3D V-NAND. Samsung is looking improve its process technologies further in 2017, migrating to to 1x-nm DRAM and 64-layer V-NAND, driving down costs. The company's system LSI business, which manufactures processors, also aided Q4 earnings, driven by strong demand for mid-to-low end app processors. 2017 is expected to be an important year for the LSI division, as Samsung looks to ramp-up production of the next generation 10-nm products from its foundry operations. These chips, which could be a fixture of high-end smartphones in 2017, are touted to be more battery efficient, while offering better performance and a smaller form factor.;Smartphone Business Largely Shrugs Off Note 7 Impact;Samsung's smartphone division fared reasonably well, despite the Note 7 recall which occurred in late Q3. Although segment revenues declined by about 5.5% year-over-year to 23.61 trillion won ($20.27 billion), operating profits rose by about 12% to 2.5 trillion won ($2.15 billion). Profitability for the quarter was aided by strong sales of the company's flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which have higher margins, as well as sales of its mid-range smartphones such as the A and J series. That said, things are likely to remain subdued over Q1 2017, as Samsung is increasing its marketing spending in order to rebuild its brand following the Note 7 crisis.  Moreover, the company's upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship is likely to launch in Q2, moving away from the March launch cycle that the company adopted with the S7. The upcoming device will be crucial to Samsung, as the company looks to restore its image as a vendor of cutting-edge smartphones, while contending with increasing competition in the high-end of the smartphone market as Apple preps to launch a completely redesigned iPhone later this year, while Google ramps up sales and distribution of its critically acclaimed Pixel devices.

CVX Stock: How to Trade Chevron Corporation Q4 Earnings;January 24, 2017, 12:44:33 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Energy giant and;Dow Jones Industrial Average;constituent;Chevron Corporation;(NYSE:;CVX;) reports earnings Friday morning. In the days leading up to the event, traders and investors alike are both asking themselves whether Chevron will trump fourth-quarter earnings expectations, or whether the corporate confessional will cause a spill in CVX stock.;Source:;swong95765 via Flickr (Modified);Let's take a look at recent announcements for Chevron, analyze the CVX stock chart and determine what (if anything) the options market is suggesting will come Friday.;"makeArticleAd();";Then, we'll set up a trade to help you capture profits from the announcement.;Chevron Earnings Picture and Analyst   Sentiment;Ahead of Chevron's Friday morning Q4 earnings release, analysts are forecasting profits of 66 cents per share. Actual estimates encompass a very wide range from 35 cents to $1.15.;The mean Street expectation implies a whopping 154% earnings growth year-over-year, as Chevron reported a mere 26 cents in profit in 2016. That result came up short of views by more than 50%. We're not holding our breath, but if Wall Street is on the money this time, the 66-cent profit would represent a sequential decline of 8.3% from Q3, which surprised by 31.5% to the upside.;Revenues are estimated to grow by 26% to $36.7 billion compared to 2015's sales of $29.2 billion. Here too, range views are volatile, with a low forecast of $27.2 billion compared to a Street high of $62 billion. Sequentially, CVX's revenues are forecast to jump by 22%.;"10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017";The Wall Street community is split on Chevron stock. Eighteen rate the stock a buy, while 10 maintain hold ratings. Price targets on CVX range from a low of $95 to $145 with a median estimate of $125.50 over the year.;CVX Stock Short-Term Trading Record;If it isn't obvious yet, Chevron has established a mixed record compared to actual Street profit views. Over the past couple years, CVX has beaten forecasts 58% of the time, while missing 42%.;Investor reaction has proven a bit more consistent, with gains in four of the past six announcements immediately following earnings.;Working backwards, CVX stock has moved 3.91%, 0.68%, -0.21%, 0.63%, 1.10% and -4.89% on a close-to-close basis. The net reaction in Chevron has produced an average gain of 0.2% in the first full session of trading. Variability of 2.86% based on a one standard deviation reading yields an estimated range of -2.66% to 3.06%.;In other words, Chevron doesn't often move that much.;CVX's seven-day performance has also allowed for a fairly benign average result, with shares falling marginally by 0.23%. However, the longer period has been accompanied by a much larger standard deviation of 5.14% and bumpier forecast range of -5.37% to 4.91%.;CVX Stock Weekly Chart;Click to Enlarge;Shares of Chevron are in an uptrend and providing a nice, lower-risk pullback entry point. The provided weekly view shows a corrective move of nearly 49% followed by a bullish uptrend, which began back in late 2014.;Currently, CVX stock is in the process of establishing a minor counter-move of several weeks. The overall shape of the pattern resembles a bullish weekly cup-and-handle.;With the handle or pullback situated above the 62% retracement level and longer-term weekly moving averages, bullish traders are provided plenty of technical support. That said, these supports comprise a fairly wide price range in CVX stock.;Testing of the penetrated 50% level and 50-week simple moving average near $102.50-$104 is roughly 10% to 11% below the current share price in CVX. Such a price drop wouldn't invalidate the uptrend, but the allowance for the current handle would certainly be compromised.;How to Trade CVX Stock;The spread between implied and underlying volatility in CVX has widened over the past month. Not only is 30-day implied volatility mostly flat, but it continues to trade in a very narrow price band - from about 15% to just above 20% over the past few months.;At the same time, statistical volatility of CVX stock has fallen to around 12% and fresh two-year lows.;Sell GoPro Inc Stock on This Pointless Karma     Rally (GPRO);The at-the-money 27 Jan $116 straddle market points to a 68% chance BAC will remain within an approximate price range of $113.40 to $118.60 into Friday's expiration. The math behind the calculated range is based on implied volatility of 25%, three trading sessions and shares of Chevron at $116.;The purest play on the earnings event is the weekly contract. Even during quiet periods like the one CVX stock is witnessing now, those premiums reflect what traders collectively expect to happen in the stock in the immediate aftermath of earnings.;The dollar move up or down works out to wiggle room of about 2.26% by Friday's close - a fairly quiet and typical event.;"Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

Better Buy: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. vs. NXP Semiconductors;January 24, 2017, 11:30:00 AM EDT;NXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) and;Advanced Micro Devices;(NASDAQ: AMD) both operate in the semiconductor industry. That's   about as far as their similarity goes. One is a rising star in   embedded solutions and automotive computing, heading into a $47   billion merger with sector giant;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) . The other is an eternal underdog in the PC   market that's working on a dramatic turnaround right now.;Which chip stock is a better fit for your portfolio? Let's   find out.;The heart of the matter;The choice between AMD and NXP boils down to two simple   questions:;"makeArticleAd();";Do you expect Qualcomm's buyout of NXP to run into any     issues in the regulatory review phase? If so, NXP shares should     fall when the merger is deep-sixed and AMD should be the     obvious investment pick.;Otherwise, NXP becomes a simple ticket to 14% returns by     the end of 2017. Can AMD beat that 11-month payoff?;Is NXP's deal safe?;I have often said that the Qualcomm-NXP combination;looks like a lock;. The two companies share very few customers and end markets, so   this merger is not likely to create any sort of monopoly.   Regulatory roadblocks would have to focus on the sheer scale of   the buyout. Moreover, President Donald Trump is paving the way to   easier megamergers by nominating anti-regulation candidates to   many key government roles. So, this buyout should be a   cakewalk.;Unfortunately, that high-odds risk has suddenly become more   likely.;Last week,;Qualcomm was served a lawsuit;from major customer;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) , wherein the iPhone maker claims that the   chipmaker has been playing extortion games with its component   supply chain.;Qualcomm shares fell as much as 14% on the news, and some   analysts expect the lawsuit to delay the NXP deal. Renewed   scrutiny of Qualcomm's business practices could block   rubber-stamp deal approvals in important territories such as   China, Taiwan, and South Korea.;The Apple charge will also divert management attention and   other assets from the NXP process. If nothing else, the final   approval might be pushed into 2018 or beyond.;This is a real risk for the NXP merger, but I still expect the   final signatures to be delivered by the end of the year. This   business combination is too important to let it slide out of   view. And don't forget that regulatory intervention would lead to   Qualcomm sending a $1.25 billion breakup fee NXP's way.;Your mileage may vary, which is fine. But if you agree with my   analysis, NXP remains a near-certain 14% return from here, and   AMD needs to show a stronger hand than that.;Image source: Getty Images.;What can AMD do?;Let's cut to the chase: AMD shares could go absolutely   anywhere in 2017. That's enough to keep my finger away from the   buy button.;The chipmaker had a fantastic year in 2016. AMD introduced a   new graphics chip architecture to rave reviews, promised an   equally game-changing update to its CPU portfolio in 2017, and;saw share prices quadruple;. AMD's chart has cooled down a bit in January, falling back 12%   as the company prepares for a fourth-quarter report next week.   But that's still a lot of market momentum. Share prices could   keep skyrocketing in 2017 if the company continues to deliver on   its next-generation technology promises.;That's a big;if;, though. AMD does not have a great track record when it comes to   dependable execution, and often falls far short of ambitious   goals. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has been a breath of fresh   air so far, but she is battling the fallout from nearly a   decade's worth of less-successful predecessors.;If AMD's momentum runs out, the stock has a long way to fall.   AMD's trailing earnings and EBITDA profits are negative, and free   cash flows stand at a razor-thin $148 million. Lacking the   support of traditional valuation builders, the stock chart would   take a dramatic nosedive in a hurry on the slightest of   errors.;AMD owners can win big or lose big here. That's a poker chip,   not an investment thesis.;By contrast, NXP offers a near-guaranteed 14% return. Even if   the Qualcomm deal falls apart, there's a quick $1.25 billion cash   payment in it for NXP investors.;This one isn't a close call. I would take NXP over AMD in a   heartbeat.;10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro     Devices;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Earnings Preview: Can Apple, Inc. Return to Growth?;January 24, 2017, 10:36:00 AM EDT;Scheduled to report results for its first fiscal quarter of   2017 on Tuesday, Jan. 31,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL)  will show whether it has returned to revenue   growth. With trailing-12-month revenue down 8%, even a small   year-over-year increase in Apple's first-quarter revenue would be   a nice change.;Here's a preview of the earnings report as well as some   background on a few key areas worth checking in on when the tech   giant reports results.;"makeArticleAd();";Image source: Apple.;The numbers;Metric;Q1 2017 Guidance*;Q1 2016;Year-Over-Year Change;Revenue;$77 billion;$75.9 million;1.4%;Earnings per share;$3.17;$3.28;(3.4%);Gross profit margin;38.25%;40.1%;(185 basis points);Fiscal quarters shown. Asterisk indicates figures are based on   midpoint of guidance ranges provided for management. Data for   chart retrieved from Apple's quarterly earnings releases. Table   by author.;After reporting three quarters straight of year-over-year   declines in revenue, Apple expects about a 1.4% year-over-year   increase in revenue in its first quarter. But despite   expectations for higher revenue, management anticipates a 3.4%   earnings decline as its profit margin is negatively impacted by   currency headwinds, higher cost structures for new products, and   an unfavorable comparison due to a $548 million award from a   patent infringement in the year-ago quarter.;3 key areas to watch;Beyond Apple's first-quarter revenue, EPS, and gross profit   margin, investors should look at iPhone sales, guidance for   Apple's second quarter, and services revenue growth.;1. iPhone sales:;Accounting for 63% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue,   the iPhone segment is undoubtedly the company's most important   business. The segment dwarfs its other segments, which represent   11% or less of trailing-12-month sales.;iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.;So, what can investors expect from iPhone sales? Given Apple's   guidance for its overall results and the influence of the iPhone   segment on total results, investors should expect similar iPhone   revenue and unit sales this year since Apple is only guiding for   a 1.4% increase in total revenue. In the year-ago quarter, iPhone   revenue was $51.6 billion and iPhone unit sales were 74.8   million.;2. Guidance:;One of the quarter's most insightful metrics will be the   guidance Apple provides for its second quarter. With this figure,   investors will get to see whether management expects more revenue   growth.;Given that the iPhone 7 didn't stick to Apple's usual biannual   schedule for form factor overhauls, it's possible the company   could return to year-over-year declines in the second quarter.   But until it provides guidance, there isn't any clear indication   of what investors should expect for the trajectory of revenue   beyond its first quarter.;3. Services revenue growth:;One segment that could help drive surprising growth is the   services segment, which includes sales from the App Store,   iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other   services. In the most recent quarter, services revenue was up an   impressive 24%, hitting a record $6.3 billion. Growing to   13% of Apple's revenue in the quarter, services is now its   second-largest segment. If the segment benefited from a   significant holiday boost in the first quarter, the growing   segment may play a key role in helping Apple's overall revenue   this year -- possibly even serving as the key factor for   preventing further declines in total revenue.;In its most recent quarter, year-over-year services revenue   growth accelerated from 19% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016   to 24% in its fourth quarter. Look to see if Apple can maintain   this higher growth rate achieved in its fourth quarter.;In addition to the first-quarter report after market close on   Jan. 31, management will host a live conference call to discuss   results at 2:00 p.m. PST.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should You Buy Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;January 24, 2017, 09:52:23 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc;(NYSE:;VRX;) has imploded over the past 18 months. VRX stock is down nearly 95% since it peaked in 2015. The company has made a fool of many famous investors, including famed activist Bill Ackman. What was once one of Canada's most exciting growth companies now sits at death's doorstep.;Source:;Wikimedia (Modified);With its market cap down to below $5 billion now, the question has become existential. Can Valeant survive? Or will it end up in bankruptcy court?;"makeArticleAd();";For investors in VRX stock, it's a matter of handicapping. Valeant;could;be a multi-bagger if it survives. However, there's a good chance the stock ends up at zero. Thus, what's an investor to do?;Let's look at the pros and the cons for VRX stock to decide.;VRX Stock Cons;Imploded Business Model:;"Ackman famously loaded up his huge position in VRX stock on the basis of ""platform value."" This was the idea that Valeant was worth a great deal due to its ability to keep acquiring new drugs. Once Valeant acquired a new drug company, it typically would raise prices for the acquired drugs while slashing R&D spending and other overhead. This made for fantastic margins.";Valeant borrowed heavily to make these acquisitions using the assumption that drug prices could continue rising indefinitely. This assumption, however, proved false following increasing scrutiny toward the sector from 2015 onward. VRX also engaged in some questionable business behavior, including using gray-area specialty pharma operations to push drugs at high prices. This window of opportunity has shut. Valeant has greatly limited capacity to raise drug prices going forward, and it doesn't have financial capacity to make further acquisitions.;10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     Back;Need to Sell Assets:;In fact, the opposite is true. Valeant is having to;dump;assets. And a forced seller rarely gets top dollar for their goods. For a year now, Valeant management has talked up imminent asset sales. Rumors of a;Salix;sale for as much as $10 billion sent VRX stock flying.;But that rumor, as with most such Valeant rumors, amounted to nothing. Valeant did manage to sell two smaller non-core businesses early in January, leading to a smaller pop in VRX stock. But that quickly gave way. The EBITDA multiples, particularly for the;Dendreon;unit, received on the asset sales do not appear high enough to justify the company's current valuation. Valeant likely has to sell more assets to avoid breaching debt covenants. And based on the past year's efforts, it could be difficult to sell more properties at acceptable prices.;Huge Debt Load:;Valeant sports about $30 billion in debt, against a minimal cash position. And virtually all of this debt is due no later than 2022. A sizable chunk matures in 2018.;Thus, Valeant is racing against the clock to come up with cash before it has to make good on its debt obligations. If lenders are generous, the company may be able to roll some of its debt over, though the interest rate would probably be unfavorable. Otherwise, it will have to sell yet more assets to stay liquid in the short-term.;VRX Stock Pros;Asset Sales a Step in the Right Direction:;While there is much more work to be done, Valeant's asset sales earlier this month are a clear positive. The company likely will have enough cash to make it through to 2018. Many prominent bears were suggesting that Valeant would go bankrupt in 2017. That looks significantly less likely now.;While VRX has much more to do, $2.1 billion is certainly a step in the right direction. The Dendreon business they sold was of low quality, and they appear to have gotten a decent price for it, all things considered. And the business they sold to;L'oreal SA (ADR);(OTCMKTS:;LRLCY;) went at a solid price, though it was one of Valeant's highest-quality assets.;Heavy Bearish Involvement;: Valeant has attracted numerous short sellers. As of data from December 31st, there are 29 million shares of VRX stock that have been sold short. That constitutes more than 11% of the total float. Since at least August, short sellers have maintained a short position in excess of 25 million Valeant shares.;Numerous big-name short sellers, such as Citron Research and John Hempton of Bronte Capital, have devoted numerous time to blasting the company. Hempton tends to;make comments;"such as: ""Valeant deserves to go bankrupt - and will go bankrupt unless the goodwill of bond holders and pharmaceutical payers is forthcoming.""";7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode;These are talented market operators, and there's a decent chance they'll be proven right. But if not, bears may find themselves stuck in a position that changes character on them. Bill Ackman isn't the only pro to ride a position for too long on occasion.;Better Drug Market Optics?;"President-elect Donald Trump will take office shortly. He's made some prickly remarks about the drug industry over the past few months, notably saying that pharma is ""getting away with murder."" That sounds bad. However, so far at least, he still appears more moderate on the issue. Hillary Clinton took to Twitter on various occasions to call out individual pharma companies and/or their executives.";Trump's repeal-and-replace rhetoric is a question mark for the healthcare industry. But it's an improvement from what would almost certainly have been a painful four years for pharma stocks had the alternative occurred. Healthcare performed worst of the S&P 500's 10 sectors last year. Unless Trump's words turn into concrete action against the drug companies, there is a good chance that sentiment picks up later this year in the sector.;Verdict;VRX stock seems appealing as a sort of high-risk high-reward play on the surface. Shares are way down off the peak. The company seems to have put the worst behind it, and is starting to make the right moves on asset sales and new management direction. But oh what a hole they had dug for themselves.;Valeant is in a race against the clock, and they need a lot of things to go correctly to avoid bankruptcy.

Total volume swelled to over 572,000 contracts, with   calls snapping up 68% of the day's take. If the shares' premarket   gains carry over into the open, Alibaba will eclipse peak 27 Jan   open interest of nearly 17,000 contracts at the $100 call   strike.;What's more, there is little in the way of additional call OI   north of this strike, by comparison, creating less potential   friction for follow-through buying heading into February.

Luckily, those trading BABA stock weren't fooled.;Source: Shutterstock;A 26% fall in earnings? Maybe, if you squint right, and you're looking for something to criticize, you can argue that earnings fell short.;"makeArticleAd();";But that was entirely due to investments made in digital media that will come back over time. And the growth in digital media sales, 273%, was a star of the earnings show. Entertainment even grew faster than the company's cloud computing operations, and total revenue was up 54%.;If this is miss, I'll take it.;Investors agree. Pre-market trading had BABA stock up to almost $102 per share, or about 4% higher. It's still short of 2016's high of $107 per share, and well short of the $115 per share achieved in early 2015.;But right now those records look due to fall.;Several Moving Pieces;Alibaba has several moving pieces, and;a detailed earnings release;offered real insight into them.;The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' Picks;"What the release reveals is that if you're thinking of Alibaba as strictly a play on China, you're thinking wrong. The fastest-growing segment of the business is ""international commerce,"" cross-border trade, mostly between China and other countries in East Asia, which was up 288% year-over-year, to $353 million, 4% of total revenue. That's even faster than digital entertainment grew.";Chinese commerce still represents 80% of revenue, but that's down from 86% a year earlier, even though retail sales were up 42% and wholesale sales were up 30%. It's that wholesale number that is the heart of the original company. Alibaba, unlike;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;), with which it is so often compared, was founded to enable business-to-business commerce, opening up global markets for small Chinese producers.;Taken together, Alibaba had GAAP net income of $2.471 billion ($1 per share) and revenue of $7.669 billion. Just as Amazon remains a fraction of the size of;Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.;(NYSE:;WMT;), in other words, Alibaba is a fraction of the size of Amazon.;But BABA is growing faster.;Where Does BABA Stock Grow From Here?;While Alibaba does seek to replicate most of what Amazon does, including its movies and cloud operations, at the heart of the growth story lies trading.;Trading is profitable. You don't have to buy what someone else is trading, just handle the logistics - the online elements, the transaction elements, the movement and warehousing. Thus, Alibaba has been able to deliver regular profits at a stage where Amazon could not, and this remains the case.;"Non-GAAP earnings of $1.30 per share easily beat the analyst estimates of $1.13, and even the whisper number of $1.16. The big numbers remain in consumer commerce within China, dominated this quarter by a record-setting ""Singles Day,"" but the big growth is in other areas.";That growth is spectacular.

Apple's Supplier Foxconn to Set Up Manufacturing in U.S?;January 24, 2017, 09:25:00 AM EDT;Per media reports, one of;Apple Inc.;'s;AAPL;biggest suppliers, Foxconn Technology Group is thinking of setting up a manufacturing plant in the United States. Though the exact details aren't available, Foxconn is interested in investing over $7 billion in setting up such facilities in the U.S.;Analysts note that that tech companies usually do not have manufacturing operations in the U.S because of higher labor costs involved than other regions like South East Asia. Apple has been subject to intense focus of President Donald Trump regarding this issue.;"Throughout his campaign, Trump opposed Apple's decision to manufacture goods overseas and even promised that he will urge Apple to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country. Trump was quoted speaking to The New York Times in Nov 2016, ""One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.""";Apple Inc. Price;Apple Inc. Price;|;Apple Inc. Quote;In fact, to alleviate Apple's concern of increased prices of finished products, Trump told the company's CEO Tim Cook that he will provide tech companies huge tax cuts.;"These promised incentives seem to have succeeded in attracting manufactures. Foxconn CEO Terry Gou was quoted saying ""If US state governments are willing to provide these terms, and we calculate and it is cheaper than shipping from China or Japan, then why wouldn't Sharp build a factory in the US?"". Foxconn bought the majority stake in Sharp Technologies, which supplies display panels for many major smartphone brands, last year for $3.5 billion.";Per Verge, this new facility could be in collaboration between Apple and Foxconn as Gou said that Apple, too, needs the display panels. The facilities could create 30 to 50K jobs in the U.S, something which Trump has been so focused on. However, Verge quoted Gou saying that manufacturing in the U.S will make prices go up as much as $500. So will consumers be happy about it?;Moreover, analyst also remain wary as it could mean taking China head on. Setting up manufacturing in the U.S. will deprive China of many million manufacturing jobs and surely the Chinese government won't be very happy about it. Foxconn has over 12 factories in China and Chinese workers form a majority of its 1.5 million strong workforce.;"Gou stressed that these plans are not ""promise"" but a ""wish"" and there is also a possibility that it might not work out at all. Apple made no comment on the development.";"Apparently, Apple is mulling to bring back manufacturing jobs to U.S. A few days back it was reported that Apple requested the government to allow it to use its Mesa, AZ facility to conduct ""high-tech manufacturing"". Apple had asked Foreign Trade Zones Board to allow it to manufacture ""finished products and foreign status materials/components"". This is because ""production under FTZ procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments on the foreign-status materials/components used in export production.""";"Per a Business Insider report, citing sources familiar with the matter, Apple will be using the Mesa facility to ""build and configure servers"" and then send it to other data center sites in the U.S. like Oregon and North Carolina. The Mesa manufacturing facility was set up by Apple in 2013 and was leased to a supplier to manufacture sapphire screen covers. However, after the supplier went bankrupt, Apple pumped additional capital of $2 billion to convert the facility into to a Global Command Center, powered entirely by green energy, to store data from iTunes and iCloud, adds the report.";At present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

How Microsoft Has Changed in the Past 3 Years;January 24, 2017, 08:40:00 AM EDT;Satya Nadella became CEO of;Microsoft;(NASDAQ: MSFT) about three years ago, with his formal appointment   coming on Feb. 4, 2014. It was an inspired pick that also   represented a change in tone from previous boss Steve Ballmer.   What wasn't known at the time is just how radically Nadella would   divert from the strategies of his predecessor and founder/CEO   Bill Gates before him.;Nadella wasn't another member of the old guard taking over. He   wasn't a Gates disciple who'd been around since the early days of   the company in the mid-1970s, but having started in 1992. He did   have a strong base of knowledge about where the company was and   where it needed to go. When he took over, he made it very clear   that changes were coming and they were going to come quickly.;"""Microsoft is one of those rare companies to have truly   revolutionized the world through technology, and I couldn't be   more honored to have been chosen to lead the company,"" Nadella   said in a";press release;"at the time. ""The opportunity ahead for Microsoft is vast, but to   seize it, we must focus clearly, move faster, and continue to   transform. A big part of my job is to accelerate our ability to   bring innovative products to our customers more quickly.""";"makeArticleAd();";Those remarks would prove prescient, as it's fair to say   Nadella quickly changed how Microsoft does business. It was a   radical remake that turned a still-successful tech dinosaur into   a company built for the future as well as the present.;Microsoft has changed dramatically in three years under   Nadella. Image source: Microsoft.;How has Microsoft changed?;Under Gates and Ballmer, Microsoft operated in a closed   ecosystem. The company wanted people to buy Windows computers, so   it generally kept its products inside that system. There were;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac versions of Office, but even those weren't   updated nearly as often as the Windows versions -- and they only   succeeded because so few options existed.;Trying to keep everything in the Windows world backfired on   Microsoft when iOS and Android phones and tablets exploded. Not   having key products such as the various Office programs in the   two major app stores started teaching a generation of younger   folks that there were alternatives.;Nadella quickly changed that. In November 2014, he brought the   signature productivity suite to Apple iOS and Android devices. In   addition, the company offered up free versions of programs   including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that allowed for viewing   documents, as well as some limited editing.;These moves, which the new CEO pushed through, also helped   Microsoft change its business model for these programs. Rather   than pushing Office as a one-time sale, the company moved users   toward subscriptions. That was made much easier by Microsoft's   newfound willingness to allow consumers to use Office on whatever   device they wanted, instead of just Windows machines.;A different company;If Microsoft had kept the walls up, it probably would have had   a long future as a steadily shrinking business selling to a core   group of business users. With its new strategy, the company has   been able to introduce Office, Skype, and even Windows to a new   generation while creating a steady flow of subscription revenue.   For example, revenue for Office 365, the name for the   subscription plan, was up nearly 70% in Q2 2016.;In addition to opening up the company's products to Apple and   Android products, Nadella has also been a decisive leader. He   made the bold decision to scrap Windows 8 and distance the   company from it by moving right to Windows 10 -- a revamp that   brought back many well-liked features. He was also quick to back   away from the Windows Phone, even if that meant admitting that   the company largely wasted $7.6 billion buying;Nokia;'s devices division.;Nadella has also been a strong champion of innovation at his   company. He supported the struggling Surface hybrid, which has   slowly become a strength for Microsoft. In addition, the CEO has   backed HoloLens, a future-looking platform that could help bring   virtual and augmented reality into the mainstream.;Microsoft is hip now;"Compared with Apple, Microsoft was always square. That's why   the old ""I'm a Mac/I'm a PC"" commercials worked. Now, under   Nadella, Microsoft no longer feels the same. It still may not be   quite as hip as Apple, but the Windows maker has gained some   ground, and its media events now also contain surprises, like the   SurfaceBook laptop.";In three years, the new CEO has taken his company from one in   decline to one that has a bright future. Some moves, such as   Microsoft's growing cloud business, can also be credited to   Ballmer, but opening up the company's products to all platforms   has changed the company's trajectory by exponentially opening up   its potential audience.;10 stocks we like better than Microsoft;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Nintendo's Pokemon Go Makes a Late Entry in South Korea;January 24, 2017, 08:25:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();";After a six month delay,;Nintendo Co Ltd;NTDOY;has now officially launched its blockbuster hit game, Pokémon Go in South Korea, on both Alphabet's;GOOGL;Play Store and Apple Inc.'s;AAPL;iOS store.;"Per media reports, Nintendo's Pokémon Go works with Google Maps, which has ""limited access"" in South Korea. Niantic had earlier sought permission from the South Korean government for access to Korean maps, which was flatly refused. Google had not agreed to South Korean government's demand to ""blur"" sensitive locations like government buildings on Maps.";Reportedly, the denial stems from the fact that South Korea remains concerned about its national security. It doesn't share warm ties with its neighbor, North Korea. The simmering border tension between the two nations has led the South Korean government to disallow storage of detailed maps of the country to be stored on any other servers except those in South Korea, add media reports.;It remains unknown how Niantic, the firm which developed Pokémon Go, bypassed the Maps issue, add further media reports. Niantic chose to remain silent on this issue during the press conference it held in Seoul on Jan 23, 2017.;Nintendo Co. Price;Nintendo Co. Price;|;Nintendo Co. Quote;"Dennis Hwang, Niantic's design director was quoted saying ""Niantic is a young startup run by a small team. We had not expected that 'Pokemon Go' would receive such explosive popularity worldwide, and needed time to 'take a breath. For a team of our size, it took a lot of time for us to prepare and localize the game for the Korean market, including translating the game's contents into Korean and such.""";Developed by Niantic in association with The Pokémon Go company, a subsidiary of Nintendo, Pokémon Go has been a monster hit. Though the success of the game didn't directly benefit Nintendo's financials, we believe that it has strengthened the Japanese video game publisher's position in the lucrative mobile games space. It was created by Niantic in association with Nintendo. Consequently, most of the benefit was netted by Niantic.;Over the past one year, the success of Pokémon Go has cushioned its share price, which is up 56.63% compared with the Zacks Toys/Games/ Hobby/Products industry's gain of 14.86%. However, the last few months haven't been pretty good for Nintendo. The launch details of its anticipated console, Switch caused share price to plummet. Even the revival of NES classic, despite a warm reception, suffered a massive inventory problem. Reportedly, Nintendo hasn't been able to supply NES units, which makes it a very hard find, thereby affecting its sales prospects.;Over the last three months, Nintendo's shares price has fallen 12.20% compared with the broader industry's decline of 6.82%.;At present, Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).;A better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is Veeva Systems Inc.;VEEV;which sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (ICPT) Stock Could Be Biotech’s Grand Slam;January 24, 2017, 05:44:43 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;The market has begun 2017 trading sideways, but don't let that   fool you into thinking there aren't opportunities out there,   especially in biotech. We're in a period of a consolidation,   which means as profits are being taken and forcing stocks lower   in some parts of the market, cash is coming off the sidelines to   buy the dips. Eventually, it will spark the next move higher.;As many of you may know by now, I like to make sure my   portfolio is well positioned ahead of that move by investing in   only the best companies out there. One such company - which is   trading at a discount right now - is;Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc;(NASDAQ:;ICPT;).;"makeArticleAd();";I've;talked about ICPT;before. It's a biopharmaceutical company focused on treating   progressive non-viral liver diseases, and millions of Americans   suffer from fatty liver disease.;7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio       Around;That sort of market opportunity gives this biotech the   potential to be a grand slam, in my opinion. Fatty liver disease   is when fat accounts for more than;5% to 10% of the organ's weight;. I think it's the American health crisis of the 21st century,   and it's simply the result of Americans becoming fatter.;Intercept's lead product is Ocaliva. It was;granted accelerated approval;by the Food and Drug Administration in May 2016 for the treatment   of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and is the first PBC   therapy that targets the farnesoid X receptor (FXR).;The company is also currently evaluating Ocaliva - or   obeticholic acid (OCA) - for potential uses across a variety of   additional chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic   steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and   biliary atresia. Intercept owns the worldwide rights to OCA   outside of Japan, China and Korea.;Now I will add the caveat that this biotech stock is a   higher-risk idea. It's likely gotten ahead of itself over the   years, but the fact that the shares rallied to $460 in 2014   underscores the ultimate potential here.;Apple Inc. (AAPL) Suit Against Qualcomm, Inc.       (QCOM) Is the Real Deal;Sure, there will be competition. And there have definitely   been some execution issues. However, I think the company will   clear those hurdles in time with three applications (PBC, PSC and   NASH) currently in or beyond Phase II and III FDA trials.;The stock is currently in a double-bottom formation, and a   bounce through $125 could lift ICPT up toward $175 in the next   year. Over the very long term, and certainly with some bumps   along the way, I still think this could be a $400 stock.;Curious what Wall Street insider Charles Payne really       thinks?;Get more behind-the-scenes insights, valuable market     research and hands-on guidance including live stock     recommendations from Fox Business's rising star.

Apple, Inc. Had to Get In Bed With Qualcomm Because of Verizon;January 23, 2017, 08:45:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;In the iPhone's early years,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) bought baseband modems from Infineon, which was   later acquired by;Intel;. The original iPhone launched as an;AT&T;exclusive, and AT&T's 3G network is built on GSM. The Mac   maker was still paying licensing fees to;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) , as all cellphone makers around the world must,   starting in 2007 with the original iPhone.;"makeArticleAd();";But things got a lot more complicated in 2011, which is when   Apple and Qualcomm really took their relationship to the next   level. It's because of;Verizon;(NYSE: VZ) .;It all started because of Big Red;That was the year that Apple;finally launched;"the iPhone on Big Red's network, ending Ma Bell's exclusivity   that was costing Verizon subscribers; the iPhone was a powerful   exclusive device that compelled many subscribers to switch. From   Apple's perspective, Verizon is the largest carrier in the U.S.,   so of course it wanted access to that subscriber base. Even   though Verizon's 3G network uses CDMA, the cellular technology   that Qualcomm helped pioneer, and CDMA is less common in other   parts of the world, Apple still recognized that it should offer   more variants of the iPhone in order to expand its addressable   markets worldwide.";It's worth noting here that China, which became the world's   largest smartphone market the following year in 2012, also uses   CDMA or variants of CDMA for 3G wireless service.;Here's an excerpt from Apple's complaint (emphasis added):;Apple has been indirectly paying Qualcomm licensing fees     since 2007, when it released the iPhone.;Apple became even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due     to Apple's desire to release an iPhone that could connect to     CDMA networks, such as Verizon's.;For many years, Qualcomm ensured that it was the only possible     supplier of CDMA chipsets, and it remains so today for the     chipsets used in Apple's flagship iPhone product line. As a     monopoly supplier of an essential input, Qualcomm had the power     to constrict and disrupt chipset supply, which (coupled with     Qualcomm's refusal to enter into industry-standard supply     agreements that would have guaranteed supply to Apple, absent     unusual or unforeseen circumstances) would have been disastrous     to Apple's business.;"Considering Qualcomm's dominance in CDMA, both in terms of its   patent portfolio as well as baseband chips, Apple had no choice   but to get in bed with the mobile chip giant. For years, it   seemed as if the pair had a strong and mutually beneficial   relationship evidenced by ongoing exclusivity. But what we now   know is that behind the scenes, Apple was incredibly unhappy but   also contractually obligated to keep quiet. The Mac maker now   says that it was continuously forced into ""undesirable,   one-sided, and unreasonable contract terms.""";Ultimately, it was still probably worth it, considering the   iPhone's multiyear growth run that only just ended in 2016. That   growth was fueled by both tapping the largest U.S. carrier as   well as expanding internationally, including in China.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

The 3 Stocks Most Hedge Funds Own;January 23, 2017, 07:07:00 PM EDT;Many hedge funds delivered disappointing returns last year.   The Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index, which tracks the top hedge   funds in the market, rose just 4.4% in 2016 -- underperforming   the  S&P 500's 11.2% gain.;The performance of individual funds varied greatly, but top   investors like;Warren Buffett;noted that the market was saturated with too many hedge funds,   and that their high fees made them poorer investments   than basic index funds.;"makeArticleAd();";Image source: Getty Images.;"Nonetheless, investors still like to see what the ""big boys""   own, and  BarclayHedge's third quarter report on hedge fund   holdings reveals three well-known tech stocks are at the top of   their shopping lists --";Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,;Facebook;(NASDAQ: FB) , and;Amazon.com;(NASDAQ: AMZN) .;Apple;Forty-five of the top hedge funds owned Apple during the third   quarter. That might seem surprising since the tech giant's   iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales all  declined annually last   quarter, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to   respectively rise just 6% and 8% this year.;But despite those speed bumps, Apple still generated $52.3   billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, held $20.5   billion in domestic cash at the end of 2016, and stashes over   $200 billion overseas. This means that Apple could easily   diversify away from its core hardware products by buying up more   companies or investing in new projects.;Over the past 12 months, Apple repurchased $29.2 billion in   shares and paid out $12.2 billion in dividends. That equals a   yield of just 1.9%, but its payout ratio of 26% means that it   could boost that payout to attract income investors. Apple's P/E   of 14, which is lower than the industry average of 17, also makes   it a safe value play in a volatile market.;Facebook;Forty-three of the top hedge funds owned Facebook during the   quarter. Facebook is a great growth play because it's the   800-pound gorilla of the social networking market and is   disrupting;Alphabet;'s business of traditional display ads.;Last quarter, Facebook's monthly active users (MAUs) rose    16% annually to 1.79 billion and its revenue surged 56% to   $7.01 billion. Advertising accounted for 97% of its top line, and   84% of that came from mobile platforms. Its net income also   surged 166% to $2.38 billion. With those robust growth figures in   mind, Facebook's trailing P/E of 61 -- which is higher than the   industry average of 50 -- doesn't look terribly expensive.   Looking ahead, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to   respectively rise another 52% and 80% this year.;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Image source: Facebook.;But Facebook isn't resting on its laurels. It's still   expanding into adjacent markets like virtual reality with Oculus   and 360-degree videos, machine learning with a dedicated AI unit   (FAIR), and even solar-powered drones for beaming internet   connections to rural and low income regions. Those moves could   all help Facebook grow beyond its core social networking and   advertising business.;Amazon.com;Forty-one of the top hedge funds owned Amazon, which dominates   the e-commerce and cloud infrastructure markets. Over the past   few years, Amazon expanded its e-commerce ecosystem with Prime,   which locks in customers with free shipping, discounts, and   digital perks. It's further expanded that ecosystem into homes   with devices like the Kindle, Fire TV, Echo, Dash, and;DRS-enabled appliances;.;That's a low-margin business, but the higher profitability of   AWS (Amazon Web Services) -- the biggest cloud platform in the   world -- offsets those losses. Last quarter, AWS' operating   income more than doubled annually to  $861 million, which   offset an operating loss at its international marketplace unit   and boosted its total net income by 219% to $252 million.   Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow 282% this year and 85%   next year.;That's why analysts currently expect Amazon's revenue and   earnings to respectively grow 28% and 282% this year. Based on   those growth estimates, Amazon's trailing P/E of 185 and forward   P/E of 93 don't look that pricey.;The key takeaway;Hedge funds often buy the same stocks because they're safe   picks. They're more likely to buy Apple, Facebook, and Amazon   instead of lesser-known small cap stocks with higher growth   potential. That herd-like mentality is common on Wall Street, but   I believe that these three stocks are still solid core holdings   for any tech investor.;Find out why Amazon.com;is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now;Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market. (In fact, the newsletter     they run,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor,;has tripled the market!*);Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for     investors to buy right now.

It must   be;almost two years;by now.;"makeArticleAd();";Speculating on;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) building a TV set used to be a favorite pastime   among investors and analysts. Sadly, the company reportedly   abandoned those plans a few years ago, after spending nearly a   decade contemplating and researching the idea. Well, the   speculation is back with a vengeance. The;Wall Street Journal;and;Nikkei Asian Review;are reporting that Apple's dominant manufacturing partner   Foxconn is thinking about investing in a massive $7 billion U.S.   factory that would create some 30,000 to 50,000 domestic   jobs.;"What's sparking the speculation is that Foxconn Chairman Terry   Gou told reporters yesterday that the facility would be producing   ""larger display panels."" Apple would be investing jointly in the   facility. The logistics costs for shipping large display panels   is much higher, so it makes a little bit more sense to   manufacture them in the U.S. It's not clear how large of panels   we're talking about.";Cue the rumor mongers;Apple has already confirmed that it is exiting the standalone   display market. The company finally discontinued the aging   Thunderbolt Display last year, and instead of updating or   launching a new model Apple chose to collaborate with;LG Electronics;to design a couple 4K and 5K UltraFine displays that complement   the new MacBook Pros.;"Beyond MacBooks, the only other Apple products that have   relatively large displays are iMacs, which come in 21.5-inch 4K   and 27-inch 5K display sizes. Back in 2012, Apple made a push   with U.S. manufacturing for both the iMac and Mac Pro. A portion   of iMac production was relocated to the U.S. at the time. In the   years since, it's unclear if Apple has continued domestic   production of its flagship all-in-one; it's possible that the   company quietly shifted iMac manufacturing back to China. The Mac   Pro is still assembled stateside in Austin, Texas, although Apple   would";prefer to shift;that manufacturing back abroad too if it weren't for the current   political climate.;The point here is that there are no other Apple products that   would need a domestic supply of large panel displays, so the   market, as it likes to do, has starting dreaming.;Two years later, it still doesn't make sense;"Here's the thing: Apple can accomplish most of its TV   ambitions without making a full TV set. That's essentially why   Apple chose not to pursue a TV set a couple years ago, since the   TV business is not a particularly attractive business in general;   margins are razor-thin, commoditization occurs rapidly, inventory   risk is significant, and pricing power is virtually nonexistent   (a function of commoditization).";There's little upside or potential for differentiation that   can be realized through deeper integration with TV hardware,   mostly since Apple can still innovate on the interface level with   software through its existing set-top box Apple TV. It can -- and   reportedly has tried -- also try to introduce TV services like   slimmer over-the-top cable packages without getting too involved   on the hardware side.;I don't know what Apple's up to, but I doubt that it's   resurrecting its TV ambitions.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn't one of them!

Today, WATT stock is getting hammered, albeit   gently, for a stock that traders usually swing violently by the   hind legs.;Shares of Energous were chugging along with the rest of the   broader market, when suddenly WATT stock took a turn for the   worst, dropping more than 5% in the span of minutes. The unlikely   culprit? A report published on;Seeking Alpha;entitled;"""Energous Corporation: Game Over.""";"makeArticleAd();";Certainly, opinionated news like that can't budge a behemoth   like;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;), but for the $338 million Energous, any news is a vine for   stock traders to swing on.;But Seeking Alpha's report is a doozy, alleging that Energous   is in way over its head and WATT stockholders are equally   clueless:;"""Nonetheless, logic and facts have thus far failed to   influence a retail investor base suffering from the most extreme   cognitive dissonance we have witnessed since Uni-Pixel or OCZ   Technology Group. The WATT bull case has eschewed substance, and   instead focused on the ""tea leaves"" of an Apple iPhone 8 wireless   charging design win.""";"It wasn't long ago that WATT stock saw a huge surge based on a   speculated partnership with Apple Inc., which SA believes to be   the only bull case for Energous - ""an iPhone 8 wireless charging   design win.""";"10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""       2017";However, Apple's latest patent filing are at odds with this.   In its more than 16 patent applications for wireless charging, SA   notes that Apple is focused on inductive charging, not the   RF-based technology used by Energous:;"""This novel approach would eliminate today's wireless charging   pads that require devices maintain specific points of contact and   orientation. Apple diagrams clearly illustrate how iPhones and   iPads will elegantly turn an entire surface into an inductive   charging platform.""";Energous' charging is slightly different, allowing for   wire-free charging through the air on any number of devices in   the room. The tech in question is also a regulatory hurdle that   WATT has yet to pass, as it hasn't been shown to not be a health   detriment.;At any rate, SA's report rightly concludes that Apple is   rarely a first-mover, and that its inductive tech, while in the   works for some time, is likely to be revealed alongside the   iPhone 8.;IDTI,;a supplier of inductive wireless charging chips for Apple's   Watch and;Samsung Electronics;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;), has previously mentioned Apple's intent to use its own tech   for iPhone wireless charging.;"The harshest reality, however, is Apple's dismissal of WATT's   technology as ""inefficient"" and a health hazard (due to radiation   no less) in a 2013 patent application for desktop wireless   charging.";Free Profits in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock       After Earnings;Energous stock was down 4.01% as of the close … but I'd   expect the WATT stock bulls to continue undeterred for the most   part.;$WATT;took this pic a few years ago, how I feel today haha.

Apple, Inc.'s Lawsuit Is a Fundamental Threat to Qualcomm's Entire Business Model;January 23, 2017, 02:13:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;There's really no way to overstate how important;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) unprecedented lawsuit against;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) is. It's not an exaggeration to say that the   complaint, which was filed last Friday evening, represents a   fundamental threat to Qualcomm's entire business model. It makes   sense then that Qualcomm shares have gotten absolutely crushed   today, down by as much as 14% in the morning.;"makeArticleAd();";For starters,;Apple's suit has more teeth;"than the regulators'. Qualcomm has been able to negotiate and   settle other antitrust complaints from regulatory agencies all   around the world, mostly behind closed doors. This usually   entails paying a fine and/or agreeing to reform some of its   business practices. On the other hand, Apple is unlikely to go   away so quietly, especially as the Mac maker feels as if it has   been coerced into silence all these years while paying what it   considers to be ""extortion-level"" royalties. While possible, I   don't think Apple has any interest in settling this suit quietly,   and the outcome of the case will affect Qualcomm's other   customers.";This is why Apple's case is so much bigger, despite the fact   that the immediate financial implications are comparable. Apple   is initially seeking $1 billion that it is already owed, which   isn't too much larger than the regulatory fines that Qualcomm has   been paying. Qualcomm paid $975 million in 2015 to settle with   China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and   South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm $853 million   just a few weeks ago.;Combined with Samsung, Apple and its suppliers represented 40%   of all of Qualcomm's revenue last fiscal year. That's actually   down from the 49% of sales that the companies collectively   represented in fiscal 2014.;Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Fiscal years   shown.;Being sued by your biggest customer is never a good thing, but   having your biggest customer allege that your entire business   model is flawed is about as bad as it gets.;"""Double-dipping""";"Qualcomm sells chips while also simultaneously licensing its   patent portfolio and collecting royalty revenue. Apple believes   that this is an illegal form of ""double-dipping"" where Qualcomm   is able to get paid twice. In patent law, the ""patent exhaustion""   doctrine, which is also known as the ""first sale"" doctrine,   states that a purchaser of a product that uses patented   technology automatically receives a license to use or   subsequently resell that product, and the patent holder should   not be able to pursue downstream customers or companies for   additional royalties, since they've already been paid based on   the first sale.";Yet this is precisely what Qualcomm does: It sells chips to   Apple contract manufacturers that are used in iPhones, while   separately requiring licensing deals from those same suppliers.   Qualcomm gets paid twice, even though when it sells chips it   should be automatically conferring the rights automatically. The   licensing business is;incredibly profitable;, with an earnings-before-tax (EBT) margin of 85%. The chip   business has an EBT margin of just 12%. If the court agrees with   Apple, Qualcomm's licensing business has a lot of potential   downside.;But at what cost?;"The royalties that Qualcomm charges are also based as a   percentage of the final sales price, another practice that Apple   argues is inappropriate. Another concept in patent law is that   royalties should be based upon the ""smallest salable unit,""   instead of based on the entire product's value. As Apple points   out in its suit, modern smartphones have become increasingly   advanced over the years with more and more features. The cellular   connectivity that Qualcomm's patents facilitate are a shrinking   portion of the total product's value. It makes no sense that   Qualcomm should collect more when customers pay extra for a   larger display or more storage, but that's exactly what Qualcomm   does even though those functions are entirely unrelated to   cellular connectivity.";"Simply put, Apple wants to pay royalties based on the chips it   buys, which it argues are the ""smallest salable unit."" Apple pays   about $10 to $20 per baseband processor. The percentages that   Qualcomm charges are rather high, too. While the company   typically negotiates each licensing deal separately, its 2015   agreement with the NDRC sheds some light. From the most recent   10-K (emphasis added):";In February 2015, we reached a resolution with the National     Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in China regarding its     investigation and agreed to implement a rectification plan that     modifies certain of our business practices in China. The     rectification plan provides, among other things, that for     licenses of only our 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents for     branded devices sold for use in China starting on January 1,     2015 (and reported to us in the third quarter of fiscal 2015),;we will charge running royalties at royalty rates of 5%     for 3G CDMA or WCDMA devices (including multimode 3G/4G     devices) and 3.5% for 4G devices that do not implement CDMA or     WCDMA (including 3-mode LTE-TDD devices), in each case using a     royalty base of 65% of the net selling price.;"Analysts estimate that Apple has been paying Qualcomm roughly   $15 per iPhone in royalties, probably net of the ""rebates"" that   Qualcomm provides in exchange for exclusivity. Using the terms of   the NDRC agreement would imply a royalty about $21 on a $650   iPhone (which is a multimode 3G/4G device). Qualcomm actually   offered Apple comparable terms. But Apple, being";no stranger to patent litigation;and licensing, balked at the terms. From Apple's complaint   (emphasis added):;"In 2015, Qualcomm made an ""offer"" to Apple to license     Qualcomm's Chinese 3G/4G declared-essential patents on terms     purportedly ""consistent"" with those that resolved an inquiry by     Chinese regulators into Qualcomm's licensing practices,     called the ""National Development and Reform Commission     resolution"" (""NDRC resolution"" or ""rectification plan"" for     short).";Apple immediately rejected the proposal;because it was not [fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory],     was excessive as compared to other licenses to cellular     [standard-essential patents] Apple negotiated at arm's length,     and was of limited value to resolving the parties' worldwide     licensing dispute.;Since Qualcomm has also been allegedly been tying chip sales   to licensing deals, while also pricing chips above competitive   prices, the chip business is also threatened by all of this. In   no uncertain terms, this lawsuit is a massive deal with major   implications on Qualcomm's business.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm Stock Tumbles Following Apple Lawsuit;January 23, 2017, 12:38:00 PM EDT;Image source: Getty Images.;What happened;Shares of mobile chip giant;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) fell sharply on Monday as analysts downgraded the   stock following news that;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) was suing the company. This lawsuit came just a   few days after the Federal Trade Commission formally charged   Qualcomm over anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm stock was down   about 13% at 11:15 a.m. EST.;So what;On Friday of last week, Apple accused Qualcomm of unfairly   charging excessive royalties for its technology. Furthermore,   Apple alleged that Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in payments as   retaliation for Apple's cooperation with agencies investigating   the company.;"makeArticleAd();";"Just a few days earlier, the FTC filed a complaint in federal   district court charging Qualcomm with ""using anti-competitive   tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key   semiconductor device used in cellphones and other consumer   products."" Specifically, the FTC alleges that Qualcomm uses a ""no   license, no chips"" policy, refuses to license standard-essential   patents to competitors, and extracted exclusivity from Apple in   exchange for reduced patent royalties in an effort to prevent   Apple from working with its competitors.";"Two analyst downgrades came on Monday following these   developments.

The $1 Billion Question: Did Apple, Inc. Rat Out Qualcomm to the Feds?;January 23, 2017, 12:00:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;There's a lot going on in;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) lawsuit against;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) . One of the main things that Apple is seeking is   nearly $1 billion that it says Qualcomm owes. Apple has been   paying what it considers inflated royalties for years, which are   passed along in full from its contract manufacturers that have   inked licensing deals with Qualcomm. Qualcomm is supposed to   license its patents at fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory   (FRAND) rates.;"makeArticleAd();";The two companies had previously reached a Business   Cooperation and Patent Agreement (BCPA), which includes quarterly   payments to Apple in exchange for other concessions, the most   important being exclusivity in supplying baseband processors to   Apple. But these payments are also contingent on Apple mostly   keeping quiet about the two companies' business arrangements, a   provision that Apple believes is intended to hide Qualcomm's   alleged anticompetitive behavior. However, the terms of the BCPA   were never meant to preclude Apple from cooperating with   government regulators if asked. At the heart of the issue is   whether or not regulators approached Apple first, or if Apple   voluntarily ratted Qualcomm out to the Feds.;Apple said, Qualcomm said;In Apple's complaint, it argues that Qualcomm intentionally   tries to hide its behavior from regulators (emphasis in second   paragraph added):;Preventing Apple from bringing its concerns to law       enforcement.;As a condition of even partial relief from its non-FRAND     royalties, Qualcomm sought to gag Apple and prevent     it from bringing its concerns to law enforcement     or challenging Qualcomm's compliance with FRAND     commitments.;As described above, through the second paragraph of Section     7 of the BCPA, Qualcomm conditioned royalty relief on a     provision that;restricted Apple from initiating or inducing     certain legal actions;"in three particular identified areas: (a) assertion of     patents against Qualcomm; (b) claims that Qualcomm failed to     offer a license to its [standards-essential patents] on     FRAND terms; and (c) claims that Qualcomm's patent rights     were exhausted.";...;The BCPA carved out, as it must, an acknowledgment that     Apple has a responsibility to respond to enforcement     agencies' requests for information. But in restraining Apple     from initiating action or bringing concerns to law     enforcement, Qualcomm conditioned billions of dollars on     Apple's silence before courts and regulators about Qualcomm's     business practices.;"That bit on ""initiating or inducing"" is a key piece here. If   Apple was the one initiating the regulatory investigation, then   it could be in breach of the BCPA terms, and as such Qualcomm   would be able to withhold payment. But Apple maintains that it   did no such thing:";"Apple has provided information and presentations only     at the requests of the agencies. Apple has not ""induced""     any agency or any other third party to take action against     Qualcomm on grounds that Qualcomm's licensing practices     violated the FRAND promise or that Qualcomm's patents were     exhausted.";Apple has complied with all other conditions and     requirements of the BCPA.;Naturally, Qualcomm's perspective is different. The mobile   chip giant issued a brief;press release;to comment on Apple's complaint last week. Here's what Qualcomm   general counsel Don Rosenberg had to say (emphasis added):;Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and     negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the     technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all     mobile device makers through our licensing program.;Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory     attacks;on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the     world, as reflected in the recent [Korea Fair Trade Commission]     decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and     withholding information.;"Qualcomm's response suggests that Apple has been more active   in ""inducing"" regulatory actions against Qualcomm. Furthermore,   Qualcomm thinks Apple is misrepresenting the pair's relationship   and business dealings. The Mac maker is looking for a wide range   of concessions, but that $1 billion seems to be hanging in the   balance of whether or not Apple instigated regulatory action, or   if it was merely cooperating with regulators as required by   law.";10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), Walt Disney Co (DIS) and Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE);January 23, 2017, 11:04:43 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;Today's three big stock charts look at names that are   making big moves on their charts. Shares of;Walt Disney Co;(NYSE:;DIS;) make the list for their recent rally that has left the market   behind, while;Adobe Systems Incorporated;(NASDAQ:;ADBE;) is finally back to breaking into new relative high territory.   Finally, in the news of the day category, shares of;Qualcomm, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;QCOM;) are trading more than 14% lower and taking out all kinds   of chart support worthy of reviewing.;Walt Disney Co (DIS);"makeArticleAd();";Disney shares appear to be reloading for another rally as the   stock has consolidated once again to its short-term 20-day moving   average. This is the third time that DIS stock has seen this   type of action since the rally started in December. Now, more   than 16% higher, momentum is suggesting that the short-term   pullback in Disney is likely just another buying opportunity.;Momentum on DIS shares has been building with   intermediate-term support underneath the rally, suggesting that   if the selling were to increase, it would be contained at two   important levels.;First, the stock's 50-day moving average, which is trending   higher and currently at the $102.50-level.  Second, this is   the same area that Disney's lower Bollinger Band resides,   suggesting that we would see more buyers some into the market   around this price point.;10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You       Back;Significant chart support builds in this area starting at   $103, telling us that this intermediate-term bull likely has a   long road to run as soon as this consolidation is finished.;Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE);Here goes Adobe again! The software provider took a break from   its rally to consolidate at the $108-level and get traction to   make its newest run to break above $111. ADBE shares are   opening trading this morning in this new high territory and will   grab the attention of traders in doing so.;The catch, Adobe's RSI reading is now hitting an overbought   indication that could have some profit takers enter the market   and begin to sell, but there is something we like about the   timing of this signal.;ADBE will not drop their latest earnings news on the market   until March 16, much later in the season than most of the   technical companies. This offers the opportunity for Adobe stock   to benefit from what has been a positive season so far, while   trading with less volatility.;"For now, we expect to see a small pullback after the break   above $111; however, this should be met by fast and aggressive   buying as the 50-day moving average for ADBE has just turned back   into a bullish trend, which suggests that higher prices are   likely as this trend grows stronger.";Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM);Qualcomm shares are trading more than 14% lower this morning   after news that the company is being sued by;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) and several downgrades have traders running to the hills.   QCOM stock has sliced through;all;of its short-term trading support trendlines and is already   breaking into a bear market trading pattern with the move below   more significant support.;3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep       Delivering in 2017;The significant support comes in the form of Qualcomm shares'   20-month moving average, a trendline that is currently positioned   at the $57.50-level. The long-term traders will be eyeing this   number over the next week or so, as a break below this on a   closing basis will draw even more QCOM sellers into the   group.;As if the company needed more pressure. All but one of the   analysts covering Qualcomm stock have it ranked a buy or strong   buy. This tells us that there are likely to be a lot more   downgrades coming forward on QCOM stock over the near-term, which   will add yet more selling pressure to the stock.;For now, the stock remains a sell and not worthy of losing a   finger by trying to catch this falling knife.;As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second       Wind;10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print       Money;The post;3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Qualcomm, Inc.

Why Apple's Lawsuit Against Qualcomm Has More Teeth Than the FTC's;January 23, 2017, 11:00:00 AM EDT;Last week, mobile chip giant;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) found itself on the receiving end of not one, but   two antitrust complaints:;one from the Federal Trade Commission;(FTC), followed shortly thereafter by one from;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) . That sounds like a powerful double whammy of   litigation, but the FTC's complaint may not actually have all   that much staying power due to the recent presidential   administration change.;Apple's complaint, on the other hand, carries no such   concerns.;The Trump factor;The FTC's complaint was initiated following a 2-1 vote. There   are typically five commissioners that are nominated by the   president and must be confirmed by the Senate. They serve   staggered terms that last seven years, and there can not be more   than three commissioners from the same political party. There are   currently two vacancies, but there are about to be three.   Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, a Democrat that was appointed by   President Obama in 2010, has announced her resignation effective   next month.;"makeArticleAd();";FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez resigns next month. Image     source: FTC.gov.;Of the two remaining commissioners, Maureen Ohlhausen   (Republican) and Terrell McSweeny (Democrat), Ohlhausen was the   dissenting opinion that voted against the suit. Ohlhausen even   took the rare move of issuing a;dissenting statement;"(link opens PDF), believing that ""the complaint fails to allege   that Qualcomm charges more than a reasonable royalty."" The   commissioner says that she has ""been presented with no robust   economic evidence of exclusion and anticompetitive effects.""";President Trump has tapped former FTC commissioner Joshua   Wright to advise on the FTC transition, and Trump is expected to   bring back a Republican majority to the FTC for the first time in   nearly a decade, along with a lighter regulatory stance. Despite   Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric throughout the campaign,   which at face value would suggest that he'd nominate outsiders,   Trump's recent nominations for other agency positions are   decidedly from the Republican establishment (including   Wright).;The new commissioners will be inheriting a complaint that they   are unlikely to feel strongly about. As such, it's quite possible   that Qualcomm can settle the lawsuit relatively quickly and on   more favorable terms.;Apple is done being quiet;In contrast, Apple's suit is unaffected by such political   matters. This lawsuit isn't likely to go away anytime soon, and   the new administration has no direct bearing on the damages that   Apple is seeking. Unlike regulatory suits, which often end in   fines and other types of negotiated concessions, Apple is seeking   nearly $1 billion that it says it is owed from Qualcomm, which   Qualcomm has been withholding in retaliation for the Mac maker   cooperating with South Korean antitrust regulators.;Image source: Apple.;"Apple also wants the court to help it obtain a direct license   for Qualcomm's patents at more favorable terms. Apple is seeking   disgorged royalties that it says have been ""extortion-level,"" and   wants to legally prohibit Qualcomm from voluntarily interrupting   Apple's supply of baseband processors. More broadly, Apple is   effectively asking for help in restructuring the royalties that   it has to pay, arguing that Qualcomm's current practice of   setting royalty rates as a percentage of the final product's   sales price is inappropriate.";Simply put, Apple's case has more teeth than the FTC's because   it's here to stay, and the outcome has the potential to   significantly alter how Qualcomm does business with smartphone   makers and competing baseband suppliers alike, especially if this   all plays out publicly. It sounds like Apple's relationship with   Qualcomm has been deteriorating for years, and considering the   extent of what Apple is seeking in the way of damages, it seems   unlikely that Apple and Qualcomm will simply kiss and make   up.;It's still possible that it will get settled behind closed   doors, and we're all familiar with Apple's penchant for secrecy.   But Apple's rare move of suing one of its most important   suppliers was intended to bring some of these practices to light,   practices that Qualcomm has allegedly obfuscated for a decade   with a sprawling web of confidentiality agreements.;Apple feels like it has been forcefully silenced all these   years from speaking out against alleged anticompetitive behavior   -- this suit seems predicated partially on principle. Apple has   been quietly fighting Qualcomm for years, and it wants to be loud   now. Settling wouldn't just feel like a financial compromise, but   a moral one, too.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Suit Against Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Is the Real Deal;January 23, 2017, 10:58:12 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) dropped a bombshell on one of its biggest partners,;Qualcomm, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;QCOM;) last Friday. Apple filed a complaint in U.S. District Court seeking $1 billion for monopolistic behavior. AAPL stock holders likely won't be impressed with the flimsy amount - after all, Apple brought in more than $215 billion in revenues last year.;Source: Shutterstock;But the litigation could have a material impact on Apple stock over the long haul.;"makeArticleAd();";At the heart of the suit is Qualcomm's baseband chips, which allow smartphones to connect to mobile networks. Without this core technology, you actually wouldn't be able to do much with your device. QCOM has protected this technology with an extensive set of patents, and has established global standards for the mobile industry.;While AAPL stock saw little initial reaction - it was up less than 1% on the news. But QCOM saw action, with shares down a grueling 10%.;Qualcomm is the target of various governmental lawsuits regarding anti-competitive behavior and unreasonable royalties. Just;last week;, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a suit (though this may ultimately be undone by the Trump administration). Then there was a similar action brought by the European Union, as well as a fine of $975 million from the Chinese government.;7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     Around;But the suit that has gotten most of the attention - and that's at the heart of Apple's own actions - is from the Korea Fair Trade Commission, which has levied a penalty of $865 million. QCOM is vigorously pushing back, claiming that its technologies are top-notch and the financial terms are within industry norms.;AAPL thinks this is laughable.;Apple says that Qualcomm is withholding rebates withholding rebates because of its cooperation with Korean authorities. AAPL also is alleging that it was coerced into buying QCOM chips, on an exclusive basis, to get relief on some royalties. This arrangement lasted from 2011 to 2016.;But for the most part, the real issue for Apple is that Qualcomm's royalties are steep, coming to as much as 5% of the average price of an iPhone. By comparison, typical chip operators like;Texas Instruments Incorporated;(NASDAQ:;TXN;) and;Broadcom Ltd;(NASDAQ:;AVGO;) generally charge pennies per unit because of the large volumes.;Is it any wonder that QCOM is so profitable?

Samsung (SSNLF): TWO Different Battery Failures on Galaxy Note 7;January 23, 2017, 09:49:52 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Samsung Electronic;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) held a press conference this weekend that was buried by coverage of the U.S. presidential inauguration and the Women's March on Washington. The company announced the final results of its Galaxy Note 7 investigation, and according to Samsung, there was not one but;two;separate Galaxy Note 7 battery flaws to blame.;Source:;Sylwia Bartyzel Via Unsplash;The second was introduced in the replacement battery after the initial issue was discovered.;"makeArticleAd();";Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Testing Marathon;It was pretty obvious once Galaxy Note 7s started bursting into flames that the battery was involved. But when the problems continued with replacement smartphones using a new battery from a different supplier, suddenly the root cause got murkier.;At the;press conference;, Samsung explained just how deeply it investigated the Galaxy Note 7.;10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     Back;Everything from the new USB-C port, to wireless charging and even software overload was closely studied and eliminated as a factor. So was Samsung's manufacturing process. The company built four test facilities (one at each site where it assembled the doomed smartphone) and put 700 engineers to work testing 200,000 Galaxy Note 7s plus 30,000 Galaxy Note 7 battery packs on their own. External testers from three different firms were also added to the teams.;Exploding Galaxy Note 7 Battery Cause: Almost Unbelievable;The result?;It turns out that SSNLF got hit by an almost unbelievable coincidence.;In its rush to take advantage of the expected low-key;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) iPhone 7 launch, it used a battery sourced from an unnamed supplier, that had a hidden design flaw. The battery lacked sufficient space to expand and contract - as batteries do - when charging and discharging. As a result, the battery's electrodes could touch, then short circuit. This issue was not caught by the battery manufacturer.;Samsung pointed out that for its own quality assurance team to have noticed the problem, they would have had to X-Ray the batteries.;Batteries from a second supplier (also un-named) used in some Galaxy Note 7s were fine. They became the go-to replacement batteries once the first wave of trouble began. However, Samsung then pushed that second supplier to dramatically increase its Galaxy Note 7 battery production volume.;The demand to quickly churn out 10 million batteries overwhelmed that company's production capability and manufacturing defects crept in. A faulty internal weld could cause these replacement batteries to also short circuit and again, the defect was not visible.;Samsung's Safety Pledge and the Galaxy S8;Samsung took full responsibility for the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco, admitting that it had pushed suppliers and the limits of the manufacturing process.;Going forward, the company is implementing an;8-point battery safety check;that includes accelerated usage testing, durability tests, X-Ray examination and physically disassembling the batteries.;"In recognition that lithium-ion batteries can be extremely volatile, Samsung has also committed to leaving more space around the battery packs in its smartphones going forward. While this runs contrary to the ""thinner at all cost"" mentality that Samsung and Apple have been pursuing, additional buffer space will protect the battery from impacts.";In an;interview with Recode;", Samsung's mobile division head said: ""I wish [that] this serves as an opportunity to improve safety of lithium-ion not only for Samsung but for the entire industry.""";Samsung also made it clear that the Galaxy S8 - due for release this spring - will be covered by the enhanced battery safety procedures.;Bank of America Corp's (BAC) Irrational     Exuberance Will End;That Galaxy S8 launch will be the critical test of whether SSNLF truly recovers from the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco. The chapter is estimated to have;cost the company $10 billion;, Samsung stock took a hit (although strong performance by its chips division more than made up for that) and its brand was damaged.;If consumers accept Samsung's findings, apology and pledge to prevent this from happening in the future, the Galaxy S8 could see a sales rebound. If the Galaxy Note 7 battery episode still surrounds the company, Apple's iPhone 8 stands a chance of clawing back share from Android when it launches in the fall and the Samsung's place on top of the Android pyramid could ultimately be in doubt.;As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;Apple Inc.

Here Are the Most Damning Parts of Apple's Blockbuster Lawsuit Against Qualcomm;January 23, 2017, 09:40:00 AM EDT;"After years of ""forced"" exclusivity, Apple finally added   another baseband supplier in the iPhone 7. Image source:   Apple.";Just days after the Federal Trade Commission sued;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) for antitrust concerns,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) took an unprecedented step of similarly filling   suit against one of its most important suppliers. The complaints   are largely the same, but Apple felt compelled to file its own   lawsuit in part to get nearly $1 billion that it says it is owed.   According to the complaint, Qualcomm gives Apple rebates that   effectively serve as royalty relief, but in exchange Apple has   agreed to buy baseband processors exclusively from the company   for the past five years. It's these rebates that Qualcomm is now   withholding since Apple has cooperated with antitrust regulators   around the world.;"makeArticleAd();";AppleInsider's Mikey Campbell unearthed the entire 104-page   complaint and posted it on;Scribd;. I'd encourage Apple investors to give it a look, but for those   that aren't inclined to spend their weekends reading legal   complaints, I've read through it in full and here are the most   damning things that Qualcomm is being accused of. (All bold   emphasis added by me.);Qualcomm tried to get Apple to change its testimony;The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Qualcomm $853   million just last month, based in part on Apple's testimony to   the KFTC. When Qualcomm learned that Apple would be cooperating   with the investigation, it tried to use the royalty rebates as   leverage:;"Qualcomm claims that Apple has forfeited those amounts by     responding to requests in the course of an investigation by the     Korea Fair Trade Commission (""KFTC""), which recently levied the     largest fine in its history against Qualcomm. Qualcomm has     withheld the required contractual payments from Apple even     though the agreement clearly permits Apple to respond to the     KFTC's lawful investigation and requests for information.";If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to     extort Apple into changing its responses and providing     false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's     release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused.;There's little enforcement of whether patents are actually   essential;When patents are deemed standards-essential by   standard-setting organizations (SSOs), they become incredibly   powerful. But companies are able to declare their patents as   essential, and SSOs do not validate these claims:;"Patent owners, like Qualcomm, can claim that their patents     are SEPs without having to prove that they are essential. Many     SSOs expressly declare that they do not test declarations of     essentiality or validity for accuracy. For example, one widely     recognized SSO, the European Telecommunications Standards     Institute (""ETSI""), affirmatively states that it has ""No     involvement"" in ""the assessment of the validity and     essentiality of patents declared as SEPs.""";Apple is challenging the validity of some of Qualcomm's   standards-essential patents (SEPs).;Qualcomm has violated its FRAND commitments;Companies that have SEP portfolios are required to license   those patents to rivals at fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates. Qualcomm is egregiously   refusing to offer FRAND licensing:;"Violation of the FRAND bargain can take several forms,     including demanding unreasonable royalties; applying royalties     discriminatorily (for example, charging different licensees     different amounts or imposing differing conditions on different     licensees, or conditioning royalties on licensees' agreement to     advantage the patent owner's products); and asserting that     patents are essential to the standard when in fact they are     not.";Qualcomm is guilty of all three.;Rivals never had a chance;Many companies have exited the baseband processor market over   the past decade. It wasn't just intense competition, either --   they never had a chance because Qualcomm cornered the market by   leveraging its patent portfolio:;"By refusing to license its SEPs to competing chipset     manufacturers, and by refusing to sell its chipsets to     customers unless they first license Qualcomm's SEPs, Qualcomm     forced purchasers of its chipsets to take a license to its SEPs     at extortion-level royalties. By threatening ""disloyal"" chipset     customers with even less-favorable royalties and license terms     if they purchased chipsets from Qualcomm's competitors,     discriminating between potential licensees by refusing to     license its SEPs to competitors, and offering only ""rebates""     rather than a direct FRAND license, Qualcomm excluded     competition in the chipset market. And by foreclosing     competitors from dealing with Apple, a key purchaser of     chipsets,";Qualcomm facilitated the marginalization and exit of     many of those competitors, enhancing its own monopoly     power.;Apple's contract manufacturers are partially responsible;Apple doesn't license Qualcomm's patents directly, and not for   a lack of trying. Instead, its contract manufacturers ink   licensing deals, and subsequently pass along the royalty costs;in full;to Apple. The contract manufacturers like Foxconn don't bother   negotiating, since Apple foots the bill. These agreements are   confidential, and Qualcomm won't even let Apple see them:;"Rather than grant Apple a direct license on FRAND terms,     Qualcomm has instead entered into confidential licenses with     specific Apple contract manufacturers (""CMs""), the third-party     manufacturers who make and assemble Apple products. The CMs pay     the exorbitant royalties Qualcomm demands and pass the costs     along to Apple in full.";Qualcomm uses these secret licenses to conceal its     anticompetitive licensing practices. Here is how it works:     Qualcomm knows that Apple is shouldering the entire royalty     burden, but by licensing the CMs and not Apple,;Qualcomm can demand higher royalties because the CMs     have no incentive to negotiate.;"In fact, the CMs have agreed to license Qualcomm's SEPs on     non-FRAND terms, locking Apple into outrageous royalties. And     the agreements are confidential; Apple cannot even see or     review them. The CMs have expressed willingness to show Apple     their Qualcomm licenses, subject to Qualcomm's consent, but     Qualcomm has refused to give that consent.";Apple pays more for less;Qualcomm is but one of many companies that hold SEPs and   contribute to cellular standards. Apple has to pay Qualcomm more   than everyone else combined:;Qualcomm's exorbitant royalties are price gouging, plain and     simple: between [REDACTED] per device, [REDACTED]. In 2016,     this was an order of magnitude greater than the royalties that     Apple pays to any other patent holder, and indeed is;more than Apple pays to all other cellular patent     holders combined.;Qualcomm used Apple to kill WiMAX;Once upon a time, WiMAX was a competing 4G standard. Apple   never released a WiMAX iPhone, which helped contribute to the   standard's loss to LTE, which has emerged as the dominant 4G   technology:;"The 2007 Marketing Incentive Agreement (""MIA"") capped     Apple's royalties for UMTS chipsets, payable at that time on     purchases of Infineon's chipsets. In exchange, Apple was     obliged to refrain from marketing wireless devices implementing     a competing wireless communication standard, WiMAX. Qualcomm     forced Apple to renounce WiMAX just as WiMAX was gaining     traction in the marketplace.";Qualcomm acted to eliminate the competitive threat     posed by WiMAX by ensuring that Apple would not market wireless     devices with WiMAX technology.;This has been going on for nearly a decade;The iPhone is now;10 years old;, and as such Apple has been seeking a direct license ever   since.;For;nearly ten years;, Qualcomm has failed to offer Apple a license for its cellular     SEPs on FRAND terms.;Qualcomm makes money when you upgrade storage;Since Qualcomm's royalty structure is calculated as a   percentage of the device's price, the company collects more for   more expensive phones:;In addition, a royalty base premised on final selling prices     means that Qualcomm charges manufacturers of high-value,     feature-rich smartphones substantially more for a license than     it charges manufacturers of basic cellphones,;despite the fact that the embodied wireless     communications functionality in the two products is     similar or identical.;This is inconsistent with the FRAND promise.;"Compared to a $100 Kyocera LTE smartphone, Apple estimates   that its royalty payment for a $400 iPhone SE is ""four to nine   times more than Kyocera's royalty for its smartphone."" That also   means Qualcomm collects more when customers pay as much as $200   more for increased storage capacity, a feature that has nothing   to do with cellular connectivity.";Apple has wanted to bring on competing basebands suppliers   for years;It goes without saying that Apple considers a wide range of   suppliers for nearly all of its components, considering the   significant benefits of dual-sourcing (reduced supply risk,   increased leverage in pricing negotiations, etc.). But it   couldn't:;Given the opportunity, many device manufacturers, including     Apple, would prefer to license Qualcomm's SEPs at FRAND rates,     and to purchase baseband processor chipsets from     Qualcomm's competitors, rather than be forced to purchase from     Qualcomm a bundle comprising a license to Qualcomm's SEPs and     substantial quantities of baseband processor chipsets.;...;Although Apple has;for many years been ready and able to switch;a smaller portion of its baseband processor chipset     purchases (e.g., for non-CDMA iPads) to Qualcomm's rivals,     Qualcomm's imposition of exclusivity has prevented Apple from     switching suppliers on a less than full-line basis, even with;non-Qualcomm chipsets priced substantially lower than     comparable Qualcomm chipsets.;There's more where that came from;These are the most interesting snippets within the filing, but   there is a lot of other information about Apple's contentious   relationship with Qualcomm over the years. This case is going to   be a big storyline for the two companies in 2017, and the legal   process could even potentially drag on for years unless Apple and   Qualcomm settle.;If the pair make it to trial, investors can expect even more   juicy details to finally see the light of day.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

(IBM);January 23, 2017, 09:14:39 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;U.S. stock futures are pointed lower this morning over   concerns that President Donald Trump will pursue a protectionist   agenda. Traders are beginning to shift away from the U.S. dollar,   with the Japanese yen drawing a safe-haven bid, and oil is also   moving lower. In earnings,;Halliburton Company;(NYSE:;HAL;),;McDonald's Corporation;(NYSE:;MCD;) and;Yahoo!

Over on the CBOE, the single-session   equity put/call volume ratio whipsawed from a one-month low of   0.59 on Thursday to a two-week high of 0.70. The 10-day moving   average, however, held steady at 0.65.;Turning to Friday's volume leaders,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) saw accelerated bullish bids following report the company is   planning new iPad launches in the first half of 2017.

However,   the note doesn't call the 12.9-inch iPad a ""Pro"" model.";Volume was brisk on AAPL stock Friday, with nearly 1.1 million   contracts traded on the shares. What's more, calls accounted for   a well above average 71% of the day's take. Overall, traders   remain heavily focused on the $120 strike in both the 27 Jan. and   3 Feb. series, with the latter bearing the brunt of speculation   heading into next week's quarterly earnings report.;Rite Aid Corporation (RAD);RAD put options were smart money ahead of Friday's selloff.

In fact, the FTC worried about Fred's taking over so many   stores.;RAD stock plunged more than 13% on the news, with options   traders once again turning to puts in the wake of the report.   Volume for RAD swelled to nearly 950,000 contracts, with puts   snapping up 74% of the day's take. According to;Trade-Alert.com;, the largest block trade on Friday took place at the Feb. 17 $6   put, where 33,000 contracts traded at the bid of 28 cents,   hinting at expectations that RAD may find a floor before the   selling runs much further.;International Business Machines Corp.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Faces $1B Patent Royalty Suit from Apple;January 23, 2017, 05:51:00 AM EDT;Qualcomm Inc.;QCOM;, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer using baseband technology globally, has recently been pressed with a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments by tech giant Apple Inc.;AAPL;. In the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple has accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.;Notably, just a couple of days before filing of Apple's lawsuit, Qualcomm had faced an anti-trust lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulator filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that the company has used anticompetitive measures to maintain a monopoly in baseband chipset market.;The FTC said Qualcomm had established an exclusivity agreement with iPhone and iPAD maker Apple from 2011 to 2016. Through this deal the San Diego-based chipmaker provided billions of dollars in license rebates to Apple subject to the condition that Apple would not use chipset of Qualcomm's rival companies. The company recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity of the deal to prevent the latter from working with and improving the effectiveness of its competitors.;"However, Qualcomm argued that the FTC's complaint is based on ""flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry"". While the chipset maker observes major flaws in the accusations, it is likely get a full hearing. In the last five trading days, the stock price of Qualcomm has declined 5.34% on Nasdaq.";The FTC alleged that Qualcomm has barred competitors from getting a foothold in the baseband chipset market by using unfair means to secure business, thereby harming consumer choice. Notably, Intel Corp.;INTC;and Media Tek are closest competitors of Qualcomm in this field. In addition to iOS, Qualcomm chipsets are vastly used for Alphabet Inc.'s;GOOGL;Google developed Android software and Microsoft Corp.;MSFT;developed Windows operating system.;Qualcomm generates approximately 29% of its total revenue from the licensing business however, this business accounts for almost 77% of the company's net profit. Moreover, the company has a history of facing allegations related to licensing disputes. The US regulator is latest in the line of accusers alleging Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position and imposing unfair licensing terms.;In 2015, the Chinese regulatory authority, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) fined Qualcomm nearly $975 million for abusing China's anti-competitive terms. In Dec 2016, the company was fined nearly $886 million in South Korea for restrictive licensing practices. Moreover, since 2011, Qualcomm has been under investigation for competition violations in the European Union region.;In its filing, Apple has accused Qualcomm of pressurizing the company in providing false statement to South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission regarding the above mentioned anti-trust case in that country. Apple and Samsung Electronics are the two major customers of Qualcomm's chipsets for modems that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for over 40% of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016 (ended in Sep 2016). Thus, a royalty lawsuit from Apple may harm Qualcomm in big way.;Price Performance of Qualcomm;In the last one year, the stock price of Qualcomm has gained a substantial 32.16% compared with 5.97% loss witnessed by the Zacks categorized;Wireless Equipment;industry. Qualcomm, the undisputed leader in the global wireless baseband chipset market is widening its presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, and mobile computing strategies which bode well for long-term growth. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is best known for its versatility in IoT applications.;However, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms and anti-competitive charges are some of the major headwinds faced by the company.

Will Samsung Be Able to Repair Its Brand Image?;January 21, 2017, 10:10:07 PM EDT;Currently,;Samsung;(SSNLF) and;Apple;(;AAPL;) are the two foremost players in the worldwide smartphone industry followed by Huawei at the third position. Samsung is the undisputed leader in the smartphone industry, as it holds 21% market share, whereas Apple holds just 12.5% market share.;Samsung was off to a great start in 2016, and the company's momentum got a boost soon after the launch of its latest flagship Galaxy S7 models. According to t3.com, before the launch of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, the Galaxy S7 Edge was the world's best smartphone. Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge successfully managed to hold the world's best smartphone position for over six months.;After the launch of the Galaxy S7 models, Samsung launched its new flagship Galaxy Note 7, which was intended to be a tough competitor for Apple's iPhone 7 models. Everything was moving in the right direction and in favour of Samsung until the Note 7 models started exploding.;"makeArticleAd();";At the end, Samsung was forced to terminate the production of Note 7 models and also announced an official recall of Note 7 devices because of the safety issues. The company reported that some batteries were irregularly sized that resulted in overheating, whereas others had manufacturing defects. The detailed explanation on this topic will be unveiled on Jan. 23.;Despite facing a severe problem, Samsung managed to remain in the green in 2016, thanks to the popularity of the Galaxy S7 models. However, the company is trying hard to recover from the damage caused to its brand.;For Samsung, a quick comeback is essential for the sake of its reputation. The company's comeback phone could be its next flagship Galaxy S8 model. It is likely that Samsung will unveil its next flagship device next month at its upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event in Barcelona, ahead of MWC.;There are several rumours that Galaxy S8 will include a 4K screen, a mini projector, a 30 megapixel camera, 6GB of RAM, a mammoth battery as well as a supercharged processor.;Summing up;Samsung is well aware of its mistake and trying hard to repair its brand image. Samsung's Galaxy S7 models became very popular in 2016, and same is expected from its upcoming flagship models this year. In comparison to Apple, Samsung brings more innovation in its devices, which make it a better investment candidate.;Disclosure:;No position in the stocks mentioned in this article.;Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.;Premium Members;This article first appeared on;GuruFocus;.
Will Apple Raise Its Dividend in 2017?;January 21, 2017, 08:02:00 AM EDT;The success of;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) has made many investors rich, and throughout most   of the tech giant's history, dividends played a tiny role.   Recently, though, Apple has embraced dividends, and now, some   income-hungry investors look to the iPhone maker for its   quarterly payouts as well as its potential for stock-price   increases. With tax reform proposals that could unlock some of   Apple's overseas cash stash, Apple might be in a better position   than ever to consider a dividend boost this year. Let's look more   closely to see if Apple is likely to raise its dividend in   2017.;Image source: Apple.;Dividend stats on Apple;Current Quarterly Dividend Per Share;"makeArticleAd();";$0.57;Current Yield;1.9%;Number of Consecutive Years With Dividend             Increases;Five years;Payout Ratio;27%;Last Increase;May 2016;Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Last increase refers to   ex-dividend date.;Apple's dividend history is short but sweet;Like many tech stocks, Apple was slow to jump on the dividend   bandwagon. The company paid a small dividend during the late   1980s and early 1990s, but it stopped making those payments in   1995 and left shareholders with a 17-year period during which   they received nothing in dividends from Apple.;In 2012,;Apple restored its dividend;, setting a quarterly payout of about $0.38 per share when you   adjust for the 7-for-1 split the tech company made in 2014. That   worked out to a yield of a bit less than 2% and a payout ratio of   about 30% of Apple's earnings at the time, which was in line with   what many other technology companies had done with their dividend   policies.;Since then, Apple has rewarded dividend investors with payout   boosts every year. Increases of 15% and 8% came in 2013 and 2014   respectively, and subsequent increases have been roughly 10% each   year. Along the way, Apple has become one of the biggest payers   of dividends in the stock market, routinely sending more than $10   billion in capital back to shareholders every year through its   quarterly payouts.;AAPL Dividend;data by;YCharts;.;Yet not everyone was happy about Apple's emergence as a   dividend giant. Even when the dividend first began in 2012, some   saw the move as a sign that Apple's days as a growth stock had   come to an end. Fears arose that Apple would begin to resemble   worse-performing mature tech stocks, despite the success of its   budding lines of mobile devices.;What's ahead for Apple?;If nothing else, the fact that Apple has achieved the largest   market capitalization of any stock in the market has reduced its   future growth potential to some extent. Yet the iPhone maker has   continued to increase its free cash flow, securing funding   necessary for its double-digit percentage dividend increases each   year. Some criticize Apple's failure to deliver revolutionary   innovations in recent years, but the company has effectively   taken advantage of still-strong demand for its mobile products   and has sustained customer loyalty with incremental evolutionary   changes to the devices over time.;Indeed, even with its dividend hikes over the years, Apple's   payout ratio has fallen slightly, now resting in the mid- to   upper-20s as a percentage of earnings. If Apple were to decide   that its growth potential had in fact slowed, it would be natural   to pay a higher proportion of income to shareholders as   dividends, and that could bring a big jump in yield to the   stock.;Finally, the potential for tax reform could prompt a different   approach to dividend policy. Currently, Apple keeps considerable   amounts of cash overseas in order to avoid repatriation taxes.   With the incoming Trump administration considering tax cuts to   encourage businesses like Apple to bring capital back to the   U.S., the Cupertino-based tech giant might take advantage of such   provisions and boost the amount it returns to shareholders.;Will Apple raise its dividend in 2017?;For now, Apple remains squarely in growth mode, and so a   typical 10% increase would bring the quarterly dividend up to   $0.63 per share. At current prices, that would push the yield   slightly above the 2% mark, keeping pace with recent stock-price   gains. The tech giant has made a habit of announcing its annual   dividend increases in late April, and there's no reason to expect   a departure from that practice in 2017. The only serious question   is whether any future change in tax policy could prompt a   response from Apple in accelerating its dividend growth going   forward.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Hedge Funds See Record High Assets, Value Strategies Beating Growth;January 20, 2017, 06:00:05 PM EDT;"For the first time in years, value-oriented hedge funds are notching results higher than those of growth funds. As return results for 2016 roll in, several prominent funds have reported market-beating gains, but data from Hedge Fund Research Institute on Tuesday confirms that funds categorized as ""value"" beat those focused on ""growth"" on 12-month, three-year and four-year annual bases.";In the category of equity hedge funds, the HFRX EH: Fundamental Value Index returned 0.85% in December, 3.64% in the past 12 months, 0.42% in the past three years and 4.12% in the past four years. The HFRX EH: Fundamental Growth Index declined 1.12%, 6.55%, 1.88% and 0.4% for the same periods.;The Fundamental Value Index also exceeded the general HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index in all periods except for December.

Total capital increased by $46.8 billion in the fourth quarter, to $3.02 billion at the end of the year. It was the second consecutive quarter of record assets for hedge funds.;The industry still faces investor withdrawals, as clients pulled $71.1 billion, or 2.4% of assets, from the industry in 2016, the second largest outflow since 2009, when they took back $131 billion. Client redemptions totaled $18.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or 0.63% of industry assets, compared to an outflow of $28.2 billion in the third quarter, the report said.;In the largest strategy in the industry, equity hedge, capital ballooned to $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $20 billion for the year, for a record of $849 billion. The index tracking the strategy also increased by 5.5% compared to the previous year, driven by energy/basic materials and fundamental value funds.;But the category also saw the fundamental value portion lead outflows, with $17 billion gone, followed by fundamental growth strategies, which lost $11 billion, as the total declined $6 billion. Investors redirected to other strategies within equity hedge funds, with quantitative directional seeing $4.7 billion and equity market neutral $3.9 billion in inflows.;Premium Members;This article first appeared on;GuruFocus;.

Qualcomm opposed WiMax, since it generated much lower   royalties from that standard, and supported the LTE standard   instead.;"The FTC claims that to prevent Apple from launching a WiMax   iPhone after Sprint deployed its first WiMax network in 2008,   Qualcomm ""agreed to rebate to Apple royalties"" received from the   iPhone maker's contract manufacturers ""in excess of a specified   per-handset cap."" In other words, Qualcomm allegedly let Apple   pay lower royalties to secure a long-term spot in the iPhone,   lock rivals out of the baseband market, and deal a fatal blow to   the WiMax standard.";The consequences of that deal;That alleged deal certainly helped Qualcomm, which remained   Apple's exclusive supplier of baseband modems until the iPhone 7,   which uses both Qualcomm and Intel modems. Qualcomm's biggest   baseband modem rivals --;Texas Instruments;and;Broadcom;-- both retreated from the market as Qualcomm's market share   rose. The death of WiMax dealt a devastating blow to Sprint,   which had invested billions in a dying standard and was forced to   invest billions more in LTE networks.;"The FTC didn't outline any specific penalties against   Qualcomm, but  ordered it ""to cease its anticompetitive   conduct and take actions to restore competitive conditions."" But   with the iPhone 7's modem production already split between   Qualcomm and Intel, Qualcomm could easily argue that ""competitive   conditions"" have been restored.";"Furthermore, Qualcomm could note that Intel's payment of   ""contra revenues"" (discounted chips, co-marketing agreements, and   financial assistance in redesigning logic boards) to OEMs in   exchange for using its mobile Atom chips was similar to its   rebate agreement with Apple.";The sound and fury (probably) signifies     nothing;"Most importantly, a Republican-led FTC probably won't   prosecute Qualcomm. The FTC voted  2-1 to charge Qualcomm --   with two Democrats supporting the lawsuit and one Republican,   Maureen K. Ohlhausen, voting against it, declaring that there was   ""no robust economic evidence"" of anticompetitive effects from the   deal.";One of those Democrats has already resigned, and the other   commissioner's term will expire soon. President-elect Trump is   expected to name Ohlhausen as  the acting chairwoman, and   the new vacancies could be filled with Republicans who will   likely support Ohlhausen's argument. Therefore, Qualcomm could   simply receive a slap on the wrist without any serious fines.;But the antitrust drama isn't over yet...;Even if the FTC lawsuit fades away, Qualcomm still faces   billions of dollars in overseas fines. Chinese regulators hit   Qualcomm with a $975 million fine and forced it to lower its   licensing fees in 2015, South Korea fined it $854 million at the   end of 2016, and it could face up to $3 billion in additional   fines in Europe and Taiwan -- which are both currently   investigating the company for anticompetitive practices.;These lawsuits could all hurt Qualcomm's QTL (licensing)   business, which generates the lion's share of its profits and   offsets the lower margins of its QCT (chipmaking) business. With   margins declining across the heavily commoditized smartphone   market, more OEMs and regulators will likely revolt against   Qualcomm's 3G/4G licensing fees -- which can  equal up to 5%   of a device's wholesale price. That could put tremendous pressure   on Qualcomm's earnings over the next few quarters.;Should investors worry about these lawsuits?;The lawsuits against Qualcomm reveal how badly the   commoditization of the smartphone market hurts the company. Its   QCT revenues are falling due to fierce competition from cheaper   ARM licensees like MediaTek, but its QTL revenues are also being   weighed down by desperate OEMs which hope lower licensing fees   can help them squeeze out more profits per handset.;These antitrust lawsuits won't sink Qualcomm, which is   expected to generate nearly $24 billion in revenues this year.   But they represent a dangerous paradigm shift in the market, and   explains why the chipmaker is;aggressively diversifying;into adjacent markets like connected cars, drones, wearables, and   Internet of Things devices.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The biggest concession of the deal is the sale of 865 drugstores to;Fred's Inc;.;RAD stock gained more than 20% on the Oct. 27, 2015, report that Walgreens - the country's No. 2 chain by store locations - would buy America's No. 3. Since then, shares have mostly hung around the $8 level, with a few peaks and valleys depending on sentiment about the deal.;That said, RAD had accelerated nicely since President Trump's election, not just on the broader market's back but also on increasing optimism that the deal would be approved.;Now, however, after more than a year of review, the FTC reportedly still has competition concerns, which means the deal might not go through by a Jan. 27 deadline.;7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode;While some believed the RAD-WBA merger would be approved today, Betsy Lordan, senior public affairs specialist for the Federal Trade Commission, told Drug Store News via email:;"""[The decision] won't happen [on Inauguration Day].

Square Inc (SQ) Stock Needs to Make Some Money;January 20, 2017, 12:11:11 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Square Inc.;(NYSE:;SQ;) has never been a money-making proposition. Like many tech companies, net income has not been their thing, man.;Growth;has been their thing. Revenues rose from $552 million in 2013 to $1.267 billion two years later, and that record will likely be beaten when the company next reports on Jan. 31.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified);Analysts are expecting;$451 million in revenue for the quarter;, or $1.307 billion for the year. The whisper on losses, 8 cents per share, would bring total losses for the year to 46 cents. Square survives on hope and cash flow, which was slightly positive in 2015 and the third quarter of 2016. Its growth is slowing noticeably.;But what if, just for fun, Square did something wild, crazy, and in-line with what the rest of the payments industry does, and made a little money for shareholders?;The stock would take off. It would take off bigly.;How Square Stock Might Make Money;Square is not going to make a net profit as a processor. It's not going to bypass exchange fees. Instead it's going to become profitable as a platform, with a host of financial products attractive to its small business base.;The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for Retirement;As our James Brumley wrote this week;these include Square Capital, whose loans have;doubled over the last year;. Square is also offering;payroll services, inventory management and analytics;to its small business customers.;This hope has sent SQ stock up 56% in the last six months, which sounds great until you take the chart out a few months, and see that stock hit another peak in April, 2015, which took it higher than the present price of $14.90. At that point, speculation on brighter days had pushed it to $15.13.;Who Wants SQ Stock?;Partly for that reason, our Tom Taulli has another reason to buy Square stock.;As takeout bait.;Square has a powerful brand (at least within its niche), it's big in mobile, and there are a lot of big tech companies that aren't in payments yet but might like a play there, like;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;).;That's interesting, but if SQ stock were going to be taken out, the buyer would not likely come from that quarter. Processing is something a tech company can do for itself, if it's interested in that low-margin business. There are easier ways to make money.;It's more likely the buyer would come from the payments mainstream - processors like;First Data Corp;(NYSE:;FDC;),;PayPal Holdings Inc;(NASDAQ:;PYPL;) and;Vantiv Inc;(NASDAQ:;VNTV;). These companies understand just how complex processing merchant payments are, and what the capacity is worth. Wait a few years and maybe some banking organizations like;JP Morgan Chase & Co.;(NYSE:;JPM;) or;Capital One Financial Corp.;(NYSE:;COF;) might come calling.;A move by any of these players could set off a feeding frenzy in the industry, one that would deliver shareholders a premium well over its current $5.3 billion price.;That may be why a processor isn't making such a move. SQ stock is already bigger, by market cap, than;NCR Corporation;(NYSE:;NCR;), which has been around since the 19th century.;The ancillary businesses may also be unattractive. It's hard enough just processing payments.;A winning premium would also make Square unaffordable for a merchant processor outfit like Vantiv, worth $12.3 billion, and make the merchants payment outfit vulnerable to takeover by one of the banks that distribute cards and serve the customer side of the transaction. Maybe;Intuit Inc.;(NASDAQ:;INTU;) or;American Express Company;(NYSE:;AXP;) might be interested in upsetting the apple cart in that way, but again you're talking about a less-profitable operation and, in the case of Intuit (worth $30.1 billion), a deal that could soak up a lot of its market cap.;A Speculation;There are many companies that could make a move on SQ stock, setting off a frenzy of merger activity in the payments space akin to what everyone keeps expecting will happen in media after Sumner Redstone dies and the sharks come for;Viacom, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;VIAB;).;Is the Groupon Inc (GRPN) Comeback Done for Good?;But waiting for such a frenzy, betting on it with your money, is speculation. Square today is still a money-losing proposition in an industry where losing money is uncommon, and a company whose growth is slowing rapidly.;Go for it if you wish, but don't hock the silver.

Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years;January 20, 2017, 11:29:41 AM EDT;Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo);Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to “Make America great again,” promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.;We won’t know for certain which of Trump’s policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trump’s policies take shape.;"makeArticleAd();";Lower Corporate Taxes;Trump’s promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (;AAPL;) and Microsoft (;MSFT;), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.;Beyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump — given his pro-business stance — were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (;CSCO;), Facebook (;FB;) and Alphabet (;GOOGL;) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (;TSLA;) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.;“Repeal and Replace”;The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to — among other things — “insure the un-insurable.” Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle you’re on, Obamacare either did its job or was a “complete disaster,” according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (;UNH;) to find a stock can will thrive.;UnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its  exposure to any changes Trump might make. What’s more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.;Not every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (;HCA;) and Universal Health Services (;UHS;) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (;CNC;) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (;MOH;).;Scale Back Dodd-Frank;Cutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money — something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (;BAC;), JPMorgan Chase (;JPM;), Citigroup (;C;) and Goldman Sachs (;GS;), financials are once again the sector to bank on.;"Written to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. ""There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank ""the number one priority on the regulatory side.”";To that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes it’s tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (;MS;) can provide. It’s not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (;CMA;), US Bancorp (;USB;) and PNC Financial (;PNC;), which Trump has made great again.
Apple Inc. Planning New iPad Launches in 1st Half of 2017;January 20, 2017, 11:23:00 AM EDT;According to a pre-publication note in DigiTimes,;Apple;"(NASDAQ: AAPL) is preparing to launch three new iPad models in   the first half of 2017. The note, which doesn't include too many   details, says that in the first quarter of 2017 -- this quarter   -- Apple will begin producing what it refers to as a ""9.7-inch   iPad with a friendly price range.""";"Then, in the second quarter, Apple is expected to begin   producing two flagship products: an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro   and a 10.5-inch iPad. The note doesn't refer to it as an ""iPad   Pro,"" curiously enough.";"Apple's iPad business has been struggling for quite some time,   with multiple years of unit declines. To put things in   perspective, Apple shipped nearly 68 million iPads in its fiscal   2014; that figure plunged to 54.9 million in fiscal 2015 and then   to 45.6 million in fiscal 2016.";"makeArticleAd();";Revenue, too, has struggled as well, with iPad-related   revenues dropping from $30.3 billion in 2014 to $23.2 billion in   2015, and then again to $20.6 billion in 2016.;Apple obviously isn't going to give up on this product line,   so its best course of action is to continue to invest in building   excellent products to try to stimulate demand -- or, more   pessimistically, stem the rate of demand declines.;Let's take a closer look at what we should expect from these   new iPad models, and what they could mean for Apple's iPad   business.;The cheaper 9.7-inch iPad;Today's 9.7-inch iPad offerings consist of the discounted iPad   Air 2 and the pricier 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The latter has a faster   processor than the former (A9X vs A8X), superior wide-color True   Tone display, improved cameras, support for the Apple Pencil, and   support for Apple's smart keyboard.;Image source: Apple.;Previously, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo;said;that the cheaper 9.7-inch iPad will incorporate an Apple A9 chip   manufactured by;Samsung;(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) . The use of the A9 chip in the low-cost   9.7-inch model, rather than the A9X that's currently featured   inside the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, should make the device cheaper to   manufacture.;Additionally, by using the A9 in the cheaper model, Apple will   be able to market a larger performance delta between the low-cost   9.7-inch iPad and the pricier 10.5-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad   Pro.;It will be interesting to see how else Apple de-features the   cheaper 9.7-inch iPad to both save costs and encourage upsell to   the 10.5-inch or 12.9-inch models. Apple Pencil and Smart   Keyboard support seem likely candidates for the chopping block   here.;In terms of impact on Apple's iPad business, it's generally a   good thing to deliver more value for the money with new products   at a regular clip, but this doesn't seem likely to be a game   changer for the iPad business.;The newer 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models;The more interesting products will almost certainly be the   higher-end 10.5-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. These should   include faster A10X processors, potentially;upgraded display technology;, and -- in the case of the 10.5-inch model -- a newer design or   form factor.;The current 12.9-inch iPad Pro launched in November 2015, so   it's getting quite long in the tooth - regular device   improvements are generally needed to catalyze demand. The good   news is that if Apple can deliver a worthwhile refresh, it should   be able to boost demand for its jumbo-sized iPad model.;Image source: Apple.;The real star of the show, though, is likely to be the   10.5-inch model. It's been a long time since Apple has   fundamentally changed the look and feel of its iPad models, but   that looks set to change with this product.;For one thing, Apple is moving from a 9.7-inch display to a   10.5-inch display, an interesting change. Beyond that, the device   is rumored to have very thin bezels, in sharp contrast to the   very large ones found on the current 9.7-inch iPad Air/iPad Pro   models.;The device may have a significantly improved aesthetic, which   could help jump-start customer interest.;"Additionally, if Apple includes the ""faster display   technology"" Bloomberg mentioned last year, then this could really   transform the user experience, as high refresh-rate displays make   things";so;much smoother.;Apple's iPad business could get a nice boost in the second   quarter from these new products. Additionally, the buzz that   these products may potentially generate could help keep people   interested in Apple ahead of the launch of its next-generation   iPhone models in the fall.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can’t Please Everybody;January 20, 2017, 11:17:36 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;I have to admit straight off the bat that I'm not too fond of writing about;Apple Inc;. (NASDAQ:;AAPL;). For starters, everyone - and I do mean;everyone;- has an opinion on Apple stock.;Source: Apple;Even those that may be uninterested in the markets, or consumers who prefer products from;Samsung Electronic;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) or;Sony Corp (ADR);(NYSE:;SNE;), still seem to throw in their two cents. That's the power of the Apple brand.;"makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');";I'm not complaining. Although I have a financial interest in SNE stock, and have owned Samsung smartphones in the past, Apple products are better. Its ecosystem is seamlessly connected, and its interface is intuitive. Best of all, the company has an uncanny ability to provide solutions for which you have yet to realize is a problem. And no - finding a good-looking, untucked dress shirt is;not a real problem;!;The central issue I have with Apple stock is that investors may be too emotionally vested. If there's any advice I can give, it's that business is all about the numbers. Holding any other view could lead you down a dangerous path.;Positive Factors Buoying Apple Stock;Admittedly, Apple stock doesn't make market agnosticism easy. The heart of the organization of course is the iPhone. Last Friday, rumors circulated that the upcoming iPhone 8 will feature;better water resistance;"than its predecessor. The improvement could potentially allow the ""8"" to survive immersion greater than one meter deep. Whether the safety feature is actually useful or not, it's a";great marketing tool;. Samsung initiated their waterproof model with their Galaxy GS4 Active to critical acclaim.;7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode;Of course, there's much more to Apple's flagship product than making it accident proof. According to;InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli;", there are already ""indications that the device will be standout, such as with OLED (organic light emitting diodes) screens, which will be thinner and perhaps even allow for bending. Interestingly enough, there may not even be a bezel, which will not only make the device look sleeker - one of Apple's hallmarks - but allow more room on the screen.""";"We also must consider the Apple stock price in comparative value against the broader consumer technology industry. As Taulli notes, ""AAPL stock still sports a reasonable valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.5X. Hey,";Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) is at 19X and;Oracle Corporation;(NYSE:;ORCL;") is trading at 14X.""";To go along with this analysis, you have to appreciate the creative synergy that drives Apple stock. Despite roadblocks like the;Supreme Court decision;that has serious implications for intellectual property rights, AAPL, and by extension, AAPL stock keeps on chugging. I don't doubt for a second that they'll continue asserting themselves in the retail market. They're too much of a;valuable entity;for any other course of action.;Weaknesses in Apple's Armor;Yet it's in the financial markets where Apple stock loses some sheen. As;Investor's Business Daily;wryly notes;", in the same year that AAPL ""opens an edifice to its greatness - a massive new headquarters that looks like a flying saucer - the company faces growing questions about its future and whether it can still surprise and delight customers with exciting new gadgets."" Furthermore, expectations are ""sky-high that 2017's 10th anniversary iPhone will be something special that unleashes the full potential of the Apple revenue-generating ecosystem.""";No one questions that AAPL stock is backed by a solid team carrying out founder Steve Jobs' grand vision. Nevertheless, that's a lot of pressure riding on the company. It's a well-known fact that a majority of AAPL's sales and profits comes from the iPhone. In fact, we are starting to see some kinks in the vaunted armor.;Again,;Investor's Business Daily;"writes that iPhone ""sales declined last year for the first time ever, during the iPhone 6S cycle. They could fall again this year, during the iPhone 7 cycle. In fiscal 2016, iPhone unit sales declined 8%, while iPhone revenue shrank 12%.""";Furthermore, there's an overreliance on its smartphone division that could come back to haunt them. A glaring example is the fact that Apple hasn't done much of anything with its premium line of Mac computers. Sure, that industry is in decline, but Apple has always been chic-cool. If it's abandoning Macs in favor of portable e-devices, it's going to be in a dogfight with discount-price leaders.;And if it can't protect its designs as the Supreme Court decision implies, that just makes Apple's job all the more difficult. Hence, it either needs to kill it with its new iPhones or it needs other products for diversification.;Technical Challenges Ahead;Click to Enlarge;This is where we get into a real tough decision. My heart tells me that AAPL is going to be just fine - and there's good reason to believe that.;But Apple stock really hasn't shown that much confidence. Yeah, it's soared from last summer, but that's what rallies from yearly lows are supposed to do. What happens next is the critical question.;In 2015, Apple stock took multiple bites at $130, only to be rebuffed. It then faltered, and only began to pick itself up just recently. Now, it's heading toward another crack at the psychological price target. Is the fifth time the charm? I'm sure AAPL stock is good for another 8% or 9% - enough to get real close to $130.;Abandon General Electric Company (GE) Stock     After Q4 Earnings;But to actually breach that level and build something substantive on top of it? That's where I have my doubts about Apple stock. What AAPL does, no one does better. But after so many years following the release of the first smart devices, the consumer is expecting much more. Apple will deliver, but what it does may not be so exciting for Wall Street.;As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE stock.;More From InvestorPlace;The Most Dangerous Dividend Stocks for 2017;3 Vanguard Funds That Are Taking on Water;The post;Apple Inc.

Better Buy: Fitbit Inc. vs. Apple;January 20, 2017, 11:14:00 AM EDT;Image source: Fitbit.;The worlds of;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL)  and;Fitbit;(NYSE: FIT)  seem to be colliding a lot these days, even if   it's just the smaller of the two that's crashing and burning.   Apple and Fitbit didn't have a whole lot in common beyond   health-monitoring apps on iPhones until the class act of   Cupertino introduced the Apple Watch in the springtime of 2015.   The move thrust Apple into the realm of wearable tech that Fitbit   was dominating.;"makeArticleAd();";Fitbit didn't shy away from the matter. The leading maker of   fitness trackers threw its hat into the smartwatch ring with last   year's introduction of Fitbit Blaze. Apple also raised the stakes   later in the year when it rolled out the Apple Watch 2, complete   with GPS and improved water resistance. The new features made   Apple's updated smartwatch more attractive to runners and   swimmers, folks that historically gravitated to Fitbit's   activity-tracking wristbands. Apple also recently began;aiming for the corporate wellness market;, a space that Fitbit has started to thrive in lately.;The battle lines appear to be drawn, but the irony here is   that Fitbit products remain;very popular with Apple fans;. Fitbit's mobile app raced up Apple's App Store chart --   trailing only;Super Mario Run;-- in the days following Christmas last month, implying that   Fitbit trackers were popular holiday gifts. Even with the second   generation of Apple Watch filling up stockings the love for   Fitbit in iOS-fueled circles remains strong. Fitbit didn't fare   nearly as well on the app marketplaces for rival Android   smartphones.;It's a whole new starting line;The popularity of Fitbit products with iPhone owners may   suggest a harmonious balance between the two companies, but what   if you could only invest in one stock? Would you buy shares of   Apple or Fitbit?;We know who the winner of 2016 was between the two   investments. It wasn't even close. Shares of Apple rose 10% last   year, a modest gain but a welcome break for Fitbit stock's 74%   plunge. However, the real question is which stock will provide   the best return for 2017 and beyond. The answer isn't   obvious.;Apple offers a history of innovative bar-raising and   market-defining ingenuity. It trades at a reasonable 14 times   trailing earnings and an attractive 13 times Wall Street's   bottom-line target for the current fiscal year. Apple also shells   out a decent dividend, translating into a current yield of   1.9%.;Fitbit doesn't pay out distributions, and it's also in a funk.   Revenue growth has slowed dramatically, and the competitive   nature of the fitness tracker market has squeezed margins. In a   sobering metric, Fitbit's stock is trading for seven times 2015's   profit, 17 times trailing earnings, and just 11 times this new   year's projected profit.;Eyeing top-line multiples, Apple fetches an enterprise   value-to-sales ratio of 3.0. That's a lot higher than Fitbit's   multiple of 0.4, but that's also a testament to Apple's   higher-margin business and Fitbit's current margin-munching   challenges.;The lower forward multiples belong to Fitbit, but that also   discounts the risks. Neither company is at the top of its game.   Both companies are expected to have posted revenue growth in the   low single digits during the holiday quarter, though Apple is   expected to rebound to 7% top-line growth for all of fiscal   2017.;Drawing the line;Fitbit faces a longer road to get back on track, but we've   seen how a hit product can spur a revival in either company.   Apple is widely expected to make this year's iPhone a substantial   update given this summer's 10th anniversary of the product's   debut. Fitbit has been acquiring wearable tech pioneers in a move   that could redefine its niche.;I own both stocks, and I wouldn't own them if I didn't think   that both Apple and Fitbit were positioned to beat the market   this year. However, deciding on the ultimate victor really   depends on an investor's risk tolerance. Conservative investors   don't need to go beyond Apple. It's attractively priced, pays a   respectable dividend, and since every few years it seems to roll   out a hit new product it's easy to get excited. The ceiling may   not be as high as Fitbit if it's able to turn things around --   the downside of commanding a $630 billion market cap -- but the   floor is also steadier.;Fitbit would be the choice for risk-tolerant investors.   Whether 2017 product rollouts resonate with consumers or more   corporations subsidize Fitbit trackers for employees to lower   health coverage costs there are catalysts for a pop. Fitbit also   remains a prime buyout candidate, something that obviously   doesn't factor into the upside potential at Apple.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

But really, what choice do I have? AT&T as a corporate entity has existed for over 50 years above the average American lifespan. This isn't Elon Musk and;Tesla Motors Inc;(NASDAQ:;TSLA;). And I highly doubt that there are T stock fan boys trolling the internet to defend the honor of AT&T.;Source:;Mike Mozart via Flickr;"Maybe that's a bit of a low blow.

At one point, T was up 4% generated by the enthusiasm.";Why Investors Love T stock;At the same time, T stock just gave investors a 30% return last year. Obviously, they're doing something right. It would be intellectually dishonest not to acknowledge and credit the successes of AT&T.;First, the venerable company is making some savvy moves. The most conspicuous of these is the acquisition of;Time Warner Inc;(NYSE:;TWX;). Although this deal has its own set of inherent risks - we are talking about media and entertainment, after all - AT&T is loaded with money. More importantly from an administrative perspective, its;free cash flow;is indeed free and flowing. If anybody can absorb the risk, it's T stock.;"10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's     ""America First"" Plans";Then there's the exciting details written in the fine print. The company has revamped its acquisition of DirecTV with standard-bearing streaming services. Also, the introductory rate for new DirecTV customers is $35 a month, which then moves up to a still agreeable $60 regular rate. Best of all, the platform is well-integrated with others, including;Apple Inc;. (NASDAQ:;AAPL;) TV and;Amazon.com, Inc;.;'s;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) Fire TV.;If initial reports are anything to go by, T has a big winner on its hands. There's good reason to believe that the late winter rally of AT&T stock was primarily attributed to DirecTV's popularity.;Of course, anyone that has had their eye on T stock knows that the AT&T dividend is a huge draw. With a 4.7% yield, that is very difficult to ignore. This is all the more true considering that high rates of passive income typically carries significant capital risk. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty certain that this company isn't going anywhere any time soon. Furthermore, the payout on the AT&T dividend has steadily increased over the last 32 years.;Is the Relationship With AT&T Getting Old?;"So why on earth would anyone cast doubt on T stock? The problem for me is that AT&T is in the maintenance business. As Taulli notes, the company has ""79.4 million business wireless subscribers, 53.9 million consumer wireless subscribers and 25.3 million video subscribers. More importantly, AT&T has the benefit of a powerful moat - that is, a nationwide fiber optic network. Replicating this would be incredibly expensive."" Although impressive, there's not much more that T can do in that department besides annexing Canada.";This is a point of heated contention, but it's definitely worth mentioning - traditional media is dying.;Naturally, I'm leery of organizations and investments like AT&T stock, where salvation comes from a steadily archaic industry. And here's another scary thought: According to;Inc;, a majority of millennials;don't even watch;television.;Don't Sweat Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock --     Here's Why;"This leads to a disconcerting theory. Maybe it's not that T stock is irrelevant; rather, it's their core business that is losing influence. If AT&T's investments are focused on chasing yesterday's trends, that might be a hindrance when tomorrow comes around.";At the end of the day, none of this matters depending on your personal perspective. If you're looking for growth and have the time frame to take on heavier risks, avoid T stock. It just doesn't have the speculative potential that's necessary to reliably produce great gains. In addition, the AT&T dividend isn't that big of a deal unless you're putting serious capital to work.;Which then brings T stock to where it most belongs - in a conservative retirement portfolio. For that purpose, there aren't that many superior candidates.

Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Just Turned a Vital Corner;January 20, 2017, 09:41:23 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Netflix, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;NFLX;) appears to have turned an important corner in regards to streaming profitability with its fourth-quarter earnings release. And that's one of the most important pillars in any argument about whether to buy NFLX stock.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Via Netflix;Cash burn is of serious concern, but the other big note about Netflix earnings for the quarter is that its original programming just keeps getting better and cements its long-term proposition. NFLX is not the kind of stock I would presently;put in my forthcoming stock advisory portfolio, The Liberty Portfolio;, but it might one day be if the valuation got reasonable.;First, let's look at the important numbers here for Netflix earnings. Then, we'll analyze where NFLX stock sits for potential buyers.;Netflix Q4 Earnings Recap;Much of the good news was driven by better-than-expected growth in subscriptions. NFLX added 7.05 million net new members globally, against its own guess of 5.2 million … and represented the largest quarter of additions thus far.;Of these, 1.93 million NFLX subscribers came in the U.S., blowing away the expectation of 1.45 million, and up 25% year-over-year. The same good news came across internationally, which grew by 5.12 million versus the 3.75 million forecast, and up 25% as well.;What's important with these additions is how they contributed to revenue and operating profit. U.S. streaming revenue grew by about 27% to $1.4 billion. Contribution profit leaped from $379 million to $536 million. International streaming is seeing improvement, with the rate of revenue increases outpacing the rate of expense growth, so contribution loss improved from -$104 million to -$66 million.;10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second Wind;DVD memberships continue to fall … but we all pretty much knew that.;What I Really Liked About This Report;I have to point out a very significant item from this batch of earnings. Netflix content has always been good to great, with very few duds. The content continues to impress, but it impresses on a very specific level.;The content Netflix is producing is highly targeted. It has been reviving series that used to be watched by millions like;Gilmore Girls;and;Full House;. It is offering comedy, which always does well. It has animated stuff for kids. It is offering intelligent, high-brow, and indie-sensibility-driven original series. Its films are a wise combination of popular culture and weird/European/indie (;The Discovery;).;Good on Netflix.;By offering the indie/European-style content, it enhances its appeal to European subscribers. I've always been a bit skeptical about the ability for Netflix to have broad and profitable appeal in non-English speaking countries. Yet it just might have more success there than I thought.;The fact is that NFLX is the first-mover for on-demand streaming content in most countries. While there is a cultural obstacle to overcome, in that most cultures want to see its own faces in the content it consumes, its better to have content at all without those faces than no content. That is what may help Netflix more than I anticipated.;Still, we need to tackle some financial issues.;Problems With NFLX Stock;Original programming is expensive, and we're seeing this reflected in the P&L and the cash flow. Netflix raised a billion dollars in debt in Q4, but once again, I confess surprise. I thought that debt would easily cost it 10% or more, but they managed to price it at only 4.375%. This is huge. It means raising debt to fund original programming will not be the cost suck I expected.;We can't sugarcoat the fact that Netflix burned $639 million in cash in 2016. The $1.83 billion of liquidity that Netflix has will fund $1 billion in new content, and another year of cash burn, but then it'll have to raise cash again. I don't think the company could get away with another NFLX stock offering because shares are controlled by momentum players now. But I've been wrong before. Clearly, debt remains an option.;Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL);And now, a final thought on valuation.;The market does what the market does. Yes, I think Netflix stock is overvalued. What might it be worth? Well, we finally have;HBO data to compare it to;. HBO's operating income for the trailing 12 months was just about $2 billion.;Time Warner Inc.;(NYSE:;TWX;) had TTM operating income of $7.2 billion. If we thus assume that HBO is about 30% of Time Warner's value (market cap of $73 billion total), then HBO is worth about $21 billion.;Including after-hours pricing on NFLX stock, Netflix is valued at $61 billion. I don't see that as a fair valuation. However, I;do;think it's fair to value Netflix stock at about the level of HBO.;It doesn't have the library HBO does, but it has more pricing power, since it's already about a third cheaper than HBO.;Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcoming;Liberty Portfolio stock newsletter;.

New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL);January 20, 2017, 09:22:09 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;It's a pretty safe bet at this point that;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is releasing new iPads in 2017. Rumors had been pointing to a   March special event for AAPL to take the wraps off its latest   tablets, including the iPad Air 3 and two new iPad Pro   models.;However, a newly released report - based on information from   Apple's supply chain - suggests the launch may be pushed to the   second half of 2017.;"makeArticleAd();";New iPads Delayed;9to5Mac;reported on a;Digitimes;story based on sources from within Apple's supply chain. These   sources claim that the new iPads are still in the planning stage,   and may not be released or even announced;until the second half of 2017;.;Many Apple watchers expected a March;special event announcing the new iPads;(the 9.7-inch iPad Pro was unveiled at a March 2016 event),   but that timeframe now seems in doubt. Summer product   announcements are practically unheard of. Everyone is in vacation   mode and not paying close attention to what tech companies are   doing. That makes a fall announcement and release the most likely   option if spring falls through.;MacRumors;"elaborated on potential causes for the delay, besides the generic   ""being stuck in the design phase"" description.

This is AAPL's flagship tablet, competing against the   likes of;Microsoft Corporation's;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) Surface Pro 4. Apple will want to keep its momentum in the   professional/enterprise tablet space.;An all-new iPad Pro model in the form of a 10.5-inch,   bezel-free device that's a more business-friendly size than the   current 9.7-inch iPad Pro likely will make its debut.;"As for the 9.7-inch form factor, that's up in the air. It's   too small for many business users, so there's a good chance Apple   will drop the ""Pro"" designation. Instead, it would become the new   low-cost midsize tablet in the Apple lineup, repackaged as the   iPad Air 3.";Experts also expect a new version of the Apple Pencil stylus   to be in the mix.;If the;Digitimes;report is correct and AAPL is forced to push the release of new   iPads to the second half of the year, the company could have a   very crowded calendar come fall.;Apple Inc.

We will see more rotation from bonds to equities in   this reflationary environment.

Broadcom Limited: Exceptional Growth At A Reasonable Price - With A Dividend Kicker;January 20, 2017, 07:58:12 AM EDT;By;Chuck Carnevale;:;Investment Thesis;Broadcom Limited (;AVGO;) has historically been, and is expected to continue to be a growth stock. On the other hand, the company is also an attractive dividend growth stock as well. The combination of high growth and above-average dividend yield is rare. This becomes especially intriguing when you consider that their cash flow generation is extraordinary, their dividend payout ratio low and their dividend growth rate one of the highest I've ever examined. Consequently, even though the dividend yield is above average, the opportunity for the dividend to grow over time appears enticing.;But as previously stated, Broadcom Limited has been, and is, a growth stock. The long-term capital appreciation the company has generated for shareholders has been significant. Couple that with the rapidly growing dividend suggests that Broadcom Limited offers a noteworthy opportunity for above-average long-term total return. Therefore, I am comfortable in proposing that Broadcom Limited looks like a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too research candidate. The cake would be the capital appreciation potential and the eating part would be the above-average yield and fast-growing dividend.;"makeArticleAd();";But perhaps best of all, the company appears fairly valued based on almost every fundamental metric you could measure it against. Later in the video associated with this article, I will be covering valuation extensively. However, as a cautionary note, Broadcom Limited is a complex technology company, and as such, its business model might be difficult for many investors to understand - yours truly included. But with that said, the rate of return and dividend growth prospects the company offers indicate that Broadcom Limited might be worth making the effort to learn more about it.;Shareholder Friendly Management;Broadcom Limited has historically achieved its rapid growth through mergers and acquisitions. In addition to increasing in size, this activity also keeps it relevant with current technological advancements.;The current company was formed through the merger of AVGO and Broadcom. Furthermore, on November 2, 2016, they announced the acquisition/merger of Brocade Communications Systems (;BRCD;), which is currently under Federal Trade Commission review. Brocade stated that they still expect the merger will be consummated in the second half of its fiscal 2017. Here is;a link;to a slide deck describing the acquisition. I especially like this recent acquisition because I consider Brocade currently undervalued and therefore an attractive acquisition.;Morningstar considers Broadcom Limited's management team as good stewards of shareholder capital. The following excerpt from Morningstar's analyst notes provides more detail and insight:;"""Broadcom Limited is undergoing an aggressive consolidation strategy by merging with several chipmakers, including LSI, PLX Technology, Emulex, and, most notably, Broadcom to rename the combined firm ""Broadcom Limited."" All in all, we view these deals as reasonable ones for the company that made strategic and/or financial sense. We also like the firm's move to vertically integrate into storage by buying Brocade, which we viewed as an undervalued asset.";"Although this consolidation strategy will leave Broadcom Limited a bit more debt-laden than others within the cyclical semiconductor industry, we like that Broadcom has clear intentions to improve its balance sheet upon the integration of each new acquisition. The company has also steadily raised its dividend each year and targets a roughly 10% annual dividend increase, which we see as achievable.""";Broadcom Limited;:;A Complex Technology Company;The following short business description, courtesy S&P Capital IQ, illustrates the technological complexity of this intriguing company:;"""Broadcom Limited designs, develops, and supplies a range of complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products worldwide. The company operates through four segments: Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial & Other.";"The Wired Infrastructure segment provides set-top box system-on-chips (SoCs); cable, digital subscriber line, and passive optical networking central office/consumer premise equipment SoCs; Ethernet switching and routing application specific standard product; embedded processors and controllers; serializer/deserializer application specific integrated circuits; optical and copper physical layers; and fiber optic laser and receiver components.";"The Wireless Communications segment offers RF front end modules, filters, and power amplifiers; Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and global positioning system/global navigation satellite system SoCs; and custom touch controllers.";"The Enterprise Storage segment provides serial attached small computer system interface, and redundant array of independent disks controllers and adapters; peripheral component interconnect express switches; fiber channel host bus adapters; read channel based SoCs; and preamplifiers.";"The Industrial & Other segment optocouplers; industrial fiber optics motion control encoders and subsystems; and light emitting diodes.";Its products are used in various applications, including enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.;"The company was formerly known as Avago Technologies Limited and changed its name to Broadcom Limited in February 2016. Broadcom Limited was founded in 2005 and is headquartered in Singapore.""";Competition Risk;Furthermore, due to the diversity of the businesses and industries that Broadcom Limited operates in, it also competes with many of the most prominent technology companies in the world. The following is a list of Broadcom Limited's competitors, also courtesy of S&P Capital IQ:;"""Broadcom Limited Competition";"The company's primary competitors in the wired infrastructure segment are Cavium Inc.; Intel Corp.; Finisar Corp.; GlobalFoundries; HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd.; Lumentum Operations LLC; MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.; Marvell Corp.; Mediatek Inc.; Mellanox Technologies; Mitsubishi Electric Corporation; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; Quantenna Inc.; ST Microelectronics N.V.; and Sumitomo Corporation.";"The company's primary competitors in the wireless communications segment are Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.; Qorvo, Inc.; Qualcomm Inc.; Skyworks Solutions, Inc.; and TDK-EPC Corporation.";"The company's competitors in the enterprise storage segment include Cavium Inc.; Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.; Microsemi Corp.; and Texas Instruments, Inc.";"The company's primary competitors in the industrial & other segment are Analog Devices, Inc.; Cree, Inc.; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.; Heidenhain Corporation; Renesas Electronics Corporation; and Toshiba Corporation.""";Concentrated Business Risk;Generally speaking, investing in growth stocks is riskier than investing in blue chips. This is primarily due to the fact that most growth stocks pay little or no dividend. Consequently, as an investor, you are generally subject to achieving a rate of return based solely on the price rising (capital appreciation). Additionally, since high earnings growth will be the primary driver of long-term price appreciation, you are also exposed to the possibility, and I would add, the logical likelihood that growth will eventually slow.;However, Broadcom Limited is different than most pure growth stocks. Although the company does grow as fast as most growth stocks could be expected to grow, the fact that it offers an above average dividend yield, which is also growing, is a real plus. Consequently, on this basis, I would suggest that investing in Broadcom Limited is less risky than investing in most pure growth stocks. Nevertheless, I believe one of the primary allures for investing in this company is above-average growth leading to above-average capital appreciation and a rapidly growing dividend over time.;On the other hand, there are risks associated with achieving that growth. The rapidly changing technological environment is certainly a big one. However, specific to Broadcom Limited is the risk of customer concentration with Apple (;AAPL;). According to Morningstar, in fiscal 2015, AVGO earned 24% of their revenue from Apple while Broadcom earned 19% of the revenue from Apple. Consequently, according to Morningstar, the combined Broadcom Limited is likely to generate 20% of their revenue from Apple going forward. There are many risks associated with having one customer representing such a significant portion of your business.;Broadcom Limited a Fundamental Analysis Video Presentation via FAST Graphs:;Summary and Conclusions;Broadcom Limited offers investors a rare opportunity from the combination of above-average long-term capital appreciation, above-average current dividend yield and the opportunity for above-average dividend growth. Furthermore, the company is available at a sound valuation. Although I believe there are risks associated with investing in Broadcom Limited, I believe they are well defined, and therefore, I believe the company is worthy of consideration.;Rarely will you find a company that transcends various investment objectives. In the case of Broadcom Limited, I believe it offers appeal to the total return-oriented investor as well as the prudent dividend growth investor. But as always, I recommend comprehensive research and due diligence be conducted before investing.;"If you enjoyed this article, scroll up and click on the ""Follow"" button next to our name to see updates on our future articles in your feed.";Disclaimer:;The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

Nintendo Co.

The company also confirmed via a message on;Twitter Inc;(NYSE:;TWTR;) that;Super Mario Run;will finally be available for Android in March.;#SuperMarioRun;will arrive on Android in March. You can pre-register in Google Play to be notified when it launches!;https://t.co/u4H9bxVi9R;pic.twitter.com/Hd5uzRcYcK;- Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica);January 19, 2017;Fire Emblem: Heroes;is;the second release in Nintendo's ambitious plan to conquer the mobile gaming market. A tactical role-playing game, there have been over a dozen Fire Emblem titles released for Nintendo game systems, dating back to 1990.;Fire Emblem: Heroes;arrives for both iOS and Android on Feb. 2 as a free-to-play title.;Nintendo Is Now Committed to Mobile;Its own mobile gaming systems have taken a big hit since;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) launched the iPhone and App Store. The company has found that it's an increasingly difficult proposition to sell dedicated game hardware - like the $199 3DS XL - and $30-plus games to consumers who already own an iPhone with a higher resolution display, more powerful CPU and a virtually unlimited library of free-to-play games.;The Nintendo DS handheld game system launched in 2004 and;went on to sell nearly 155 million units;. Apple released the iPhone in 2007, but the smartphone didn't really begin to show its promise as a mobile gaming platform until the year after, when Apple launched its App Store. It was all downhill from there for Nintendo's mobile gaming business. The number of games exploded on the App Store. Major game publishers like;Electronic Arts Inc.;(NASDAQ:;EA;) began releasing titles for the iPhone as well and even when they weren't free, they were a fraction of the price of games for consoles.;As a result, the 3DS series has sold just 58 million units for Nintendo. Making things worse, the Wii U was a sales disaster … that puts pressure on Nintendo as mobile gaming is more critical to its bottom line than ever.;Recognizing the potential for complete disaster, Nintendo opted to finally throw in the towel and;join the smartphone gaming world;. Leveraging its popular games and characters offers the opportunity to cash in on the market, even if it means the potential for giving up some 3DS sales.;"The Lessons of ""Super Mario Run""";Fire Emblem: Heroes;is the second game in Nintendo's smartphone release schedule. The first was;Super Mario Run;, which launched on Dec. 15 for iOS. Everyone will be watching closely to see how this title performs after lessons Nintendo learned from;Super Mario Run;.;That first game was a massive hit, in that it saw record downloads of;40 million in just its first four days;. In comparison, the;top-selling 3DS title;of all time is;Pokemon X & Y;with 15.64 million copies. However, that 3DS game retails for $40, while;Super Mario Run;was a free download. To play beyond the first few levels (for me, this was just 15 minutes of gameplay) costs $10. And according to the;Wall Street Journal;,;as few as 3% of players;actually forked over that cash. When you take Apple's 30% App Store cut from that, the numbers aren't quite so impressive.;Nintendo also took heat for delaying the Android release of the game. Considering that the vast majority of smartphones out there run;Alphabet Inc's;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) Android software, not iOS, that was likely a costly choice. The company finally;confirmed a March release date;in a tweet, but by now much of the excitement has died down.;With;Fire Emblem: Heroes,;Nintendo is going with a simultaneous release on iOS and Android. Like;Super Mario Run;, it's a free download, but this time Nintendo appears to be going with a more traditional freemium pricing model, offering in-app purchases instead of requiring a lump sum payment to unlock the majority of the game.;Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;Nintendo has a very busy two months ahead. Its new Switch console - and Wii U replacement - launches on March 3.;Fire Emblem: Heroes;will be released for iOS and Android on Feb. 2. And;Super Mario Run;finally hits Android in March. For Nintendo, February and March 2017 could well turn out to be the most important 60 days in its history.;As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It;"10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's ""America First"" Plans";The post;Nintendo Co.

The rumor claims that the release will include new 9.7-inch,   10.5-inch and 12.9-inch tablets.

Will NVIDIA Corporation's Smart Home Plans Take Off?;January 19, 2017, 12:43:00 PM EDT;NVIDIA;(NASDAQ: NVDA) recently unveiled Spot, a $50 golf ball-sized   microphone which can be plugged into any electrical socket. The   device picks up speech up to 20 feet away and synchronizes with   NVIDIA's Shield TV set-top box to control smart home devices.;The NVIDIA Spot. Image source: NVIDIA.;"makeArticleAd();";But instead of building an ecosystem from scratch, NVIDIA has   tethered Spot to;Alphabet';s(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Assistant and;Samsung;"'s SmartThings as a ""universal remote"" for both platforms. The   Spot and Shield TV will be compatible with Google AI out of the   box, but customers need to purchase an additional dongle to add   SmartThings compatibility. The Spot will also only be compatible   with the Shield TV, and not other hubs like Google Home.";NVIDIA's approach is interesting, but can it help the GPU   giant gain ground in the highly competitive smart home market? Or   will it be overshadowed by more widely recognized products like   Google Home and;Amazon;'s(NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo devices?;A closer look at Nvidia's Shield devices;After NVIDIA's Tegra CPUs failed to gain ground in the   smartphone and tablet markets, the chipmaker launched the Shield   family of devices (a handheld, gaming tablet, and set-top box) to   showcase the Tegra's capabilities.;Those devices didn't gain much mainstream momentum, but they   appealed to niche users who wanted to play Android games on   multiple screens or stream PC games to other devices. More   importantly, the Shield gaming tablet got the attention of;Nintendo;, which had NVIDIA supply custom Tegra processors for  its   new Switch consoles.;NVIDIA's Shield TV. Image source: NVIDIA.;It could be about connecting cars to homes;Despite that progress, the Tegra's core market remains the   automotive one, where it powers infotainment and navigation   systems in high-end cars. That's why NVIDIA's automotive revenue   rose 61% annually last quarter and accounted for  6% of its   top line.;But the ties between smart homes and connected cars are   already appearing. Amazon, for example, is working with;Ford;"to have  its cars ""talk"" to its smart homes via Echo   and vice versa. Ford's Sync connect system enables car owners to   remotely start their cars from inside the house, turn off lights   from inside the car, and check the status of their   computer-monitored components via Alexa.";Therefore, NVIDIA's move into the smart home market could be   an attempt to establish similar connections between its   Tegra-powered vehicles, Spot, and Shield TV devices. It certainly   could leverage its strength in the automotive market to do so,   but Amazon, Google, Samsung, and others might have a better   starting position from;inside;the house.;The upcoming smart home battle;Each of these smart home players has unique advantages.   Amazon's robust sales of cheap Echo devices, its prisoner-taking   Prime ecosystem, and the gradual introduction of Dash buttons and   DRS-enabled appliances make it a natural fit for linking homes to   the internet. Amazon's Echo Dot costs the same as NVIDIA's Spot,   but doesn't require an additional set-top box like the Shield TV   -- which starts at  $200.;Google Home, which costs $130, is more expensive than the Spot   but doesn't require an additional set-top box. That could make it   the ideal choice for customers who are heavily dependent on   Google's massive ecosystem of services. Meanwhile, Samsung's   SmartThings customers might already own the SmartThings hub,   which lets them control their smart appliances via a mobile app   -- which makes the Spot and Shield TV combination seem   redundant.;Investors also shouldn't forget about;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which has already tethered plenty of home   automation devices to its HomeKit platform. Apple is also   reportedly planning to launch a Siri-powered smart speaker to    compete against Home and Echo. Looking further ahead,;Facebook;will launch its home automation platform Jarvis, which   could  extend the social network's reach into your connected   appliances. Therefore, NVIDIA's Spot could easily be left behind   as these tech titans battle it out for control of the smart home   market.;But let's not get ahead of ourselves...;Research firm Markets and Markets estimates that the smart   home market could  grow from $47 billion in 2015 to $122   billion by 2022. But investors should take that bullish forecast   with a grain of salt, since security issues, privacy concerns,   and the challenge of changing everyday routines could easily   throttle the market's growth.;Therefore, NVIDIA's expansion into the smart home market   deserves attention, but it won't likely become a pillar of growth   anytime soon. Instead, investors should focus on its growth in   gaming GPUs, data center GPUs (for machine learning), and   automotive CPUs instead.;10 stocks we like better than Nvidia;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Nvidia wasn't one of     them!

3 Reasons Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Should Buy Fitbit Inc (FIT);January 19, 2017, 12:40:44 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;New President-elect Donald Trump places;corporate tax reform;, including repatriation of overseas earnings, high on his economic agenda. This will affect;cash-rich tech companies;such as;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;), which hold billions of dollars overseas.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;iphonedigital via Flickr;Now might be the time for Apple to start thinking about what it wants to do with the money, including possible acquisitions.;Smart acquisitions could boost the price of Apple stock by increasing earnings per share, bringing in talent and strengthening Apple's ecosystem. Buying;Fitbit Inc;(NYSE:;FIT;) would strengthen Apple's position in the wearables market, which should help AAPL stock in the long run.;Currently, the;wearables market faces pain;, as slower-than-expected growth chips away at stock prices. But wearables, including fitness trackers, remains a young technology, still in the early stages of growth.;Demand for wearables should remain strong as consumers age and become more health-conscious, and workplaces and insurers encourage their purchase.;10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print Money;In a recent survey of the U.S., U.K. and Australian markets, research firm;Gartner;put the penetration of fitness trackers at 19% and smartwatches at 10%.;And Brian Nichols of;Investorplace.com;"recommended that Apple buy Fitbit in April. I don't think the case for Apple buying Fitbit has weakened since then; Fitbit stock is probably an even better value buy right now.";Why Apple Should Buy Fitbit: FIT Stock Trades at Low Multiples;The market has savaged Fitbit stock over the past year, and it has fallen 60% over the past year. Indeed, the stock has been falling since 2015, when it traded at $50 a share. Apple would be buying FIT at near-bargain basement prices.;Fitbit stock trades at 0.69 times sales and 1.42 times book value. Cash accounts for 37% of FIT's market cap, with $2.97 per share. Fitbit's enterprise value is 3.85 times EBITDA. Fitbit also trades at 2.06 times net current asset value, which;Jonathan Heller;recommended it for.;"Investors tend to overreact; in a fit of irrational exuberance, they sent Fitbit stock up from its IPO price of $20 in June 2015 to $50 a share by August 2015. Now, the market is probably overreacting in the opposite direction: pricing in the worst-case scenario.";"Fitbit stock already trades at 3.22 times net working capital, its liquidation value; how much lower can it go?";At such low prices, the risk of Apple making a mistake by buying FIT is very low.;Why Apple Should Buy Fitbit: More Services Revenue;Purchasing Fitbit would also help Apple increase its revenue from services.;Mark Spoonauer;noted that by buying FIT, Apple could accelerate the adoption of Apple Pay. New Fitbit devices could come preloaded with Apple Pay. The mobile payments industry exhibits network effects: with more people using Apple Pay, more merchants will decide to accept payments from Apple Pay.;17 million people;use Fitbit devices daily.;FIT stock already is;developing wearables;that can make payments, having purchased Coin's wearable payments division. Both Fitbit and Apple Pay use NFC technology, so making them work together shouldn't be too difficult.;Also, Apple is interested in;digital health;, and wearables can be a source of subscription revenue from health services. Fitbit users can pay $39.99 for a one-year subscription to;FitStar Premium;to access workouts and other personalized services.;Why Apple Should Buy Fitbit: Synergies;An Apple purchase of Fitbit should unlock some synergies: 1 + 1 = 3.;Apple will be able to integrate Fitbit's 17 million active users into a network with Apple Watch users. Social engagement matters for wearables, since people tend to use fitness trackers less if they don't have friends using them too. Fitbit found that users with;one or more friends using Fitbit;took 700 steps a day more than those without.

Why 2017 Could Be This Little Known Stock's Best Year Yet;January 19, 2017, 12:30:00 PM EDT;Machine-vision company;Cognex Corporation;(NASDAQ: CGNX) is not a cheap stock by either current valuations   or near-term analyst estimates. Moreover, the stock has more than   doubled in the past year, leaving investors wondering whether   there is more to come in 2017. Arguably, Cognex needs to beat   analyst estimates to move significantly higher this year, but I   think there's good reason the company might just do that, and   here's why.;Cognex Corporation is a growth stock;Cognex's machine vision solutions capture and process images   in order to help corporations operationally guide devices to   properly execute functions--think of a robotic arm being guided   toward assembly of an automobile. With that in mind, there   are three key growth drivers to focus on for 2017:;A recovery in industrial production in the U.S. is likely     to lead to a freeing up of capital spending among manufacturers     -- something highly likely to benefit Cognex's factory     automation solutions.;Cognex's largest customer is;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which accounted for 18% of revenue in 2015,     and a similar kind of deal with a consumer-electronics company,     or even additional deals with Apple, would lead to a step     change in revenue.;Cognex has been expanding its total addressable market     (TAM) in recent years and has ample growth opportunities in     areas such as logistics, mobile terminals, and 3D vision.;"makeArticleAd();";Image source: Getty Images.;U.S. industrial production;Most forecasters are predicting that U.S. industrial   conditions will improve this year. For example,;FedEx Corporation;(NYSE: FDX) predicts that U.S. industrial production will   increase to 1.3% and 2.2% in 2017 and 2018, from a decline of 1%   in 2016. If this occurs, then Cognex is likely to be a major   beneficiary, because its Americas operations have been the weak   spot in the company's sales efforts in the past couple of   years.;"For example, back in the second quarter of 2015, CEO Rob   Willett spoke of a modest year-on-year increase in factory   automation revenue from the Americas and said ""spending by   manufacturers in the Americas has slowed and we have experienced   delays in closing some large projects."" Fast-forward to the last   set of earnings in October, and Willett outlined how ""spending by   U.S. manufacturers in many industries remains lackluster.""";Cognex's factory automation solutions help guide, inspect,   gauge, and identify automated processes and as such are largely   reliant on capital spending. It's the first thing likely to get   cut in a slowdown and also the first to be increased when   companies feel more confident.;More Apple and Apple-like deals to come?;Cognex's management sees consumer electronics and logistics as   two key areas of growth, and it's worth taking a step back to see   how transformational the Apple deal was. In 2012 and 2013, no   single customer accounted for more than 10% of Cognex's revenue.   However, after the Apple deal was inked, the consumer-electronics   giant accounted for 16% of 2014 revenue and then 18% in 2015.   Here's what the step changes in revenue, income, and free cash   flow (with no significant impact on margin) look like:;CGNX Revenue (TTM);data by;YCharts;More revenue from Apple is somewhat contingent on new product   introductions, and the iPhone maker has been significantly   increasing capital expenditures and research-and-development   spending in recent years:;AAPL Capital Expenditures (TTM);data by;YCharts;New growth areas;Cognex's CFO Richard Morin recently outlined the company's TAM   at the Needham Growth Conference, the key points of which you'll   see in a moment. For reference, Cognex's trailing yearly revenue   is only $489 million, meaning Cognex is selling into less than   17% of its TAM. Given that it's the leading player in highly   fragmented machine-vision marketplace -- Japanese rival;Keyence;is a company nearly eight times larger but sells less into this   particular market -- Cognex clearly has plenty of growth   potential.;While its share of TAM in 2D vision is above 20% and in the   mid-teens in ID factory automation, Cognex is still growing   strongly. For example, Morin outlined that factory automation is   growing by more than 20%. Meanwhile, logistics (a market that   contributes around 10% of Cognex's current sales), life sciences,   and 3D are all markets where Cognex has a TAM share in the single   digits. Cognex has negligible revenue in mobile terminals and   airport baggage handling.;Data source: Cognex Corporation. Chart by author.;In short, Cognex has plenty of growth potential and logistics   is key opportunity. For example, FedEx and;UPS;both;are under pressure to expand their networks;and invest in productivity-enhancing solutions to deal with   e-commerce growth. This is a trend likely to be relevant across   the entire logistics industry, and if so Cognex could be a key   beneficiary.;CGNX EV to EBITDA (Forward);data by;YCharts;Looking ahead;All told, Cognex has plenty of growth drivers, and despite   being on a hefty valuation--see chart above --- it could   still have a great year in 2017. All it will take is one or two   large deals to be signed and analyst estimates will be revised   higher, and for growth orientated investors Cognex might well be   a very attractive stock.;10 stocks we like better than Cognex;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Cognex wasn't one of     them!

Leading Stocks That Are Driving A Hot Mutual Fund's Rally;January 19, 2017, 11:22:38 AM EDT;American Century All-Cap Growth Fund (;TWGTX;) is enjoying an uptick in performance so far this year relative   to its large-cap growth rivals. The outperformance stems from   recent gains by the type of stocks it has long favored: U.S.   stocks with sustainable accelerating growth. Two of the places   it's finding those are in internet leaders and electronic payment   platforms. The surge has $1 billion All-Cap Growth pointing back   in the direction of its long-term outperformance.;So far in this young year, the fund is up 3.31%, going into   Thursday. That tops 66% of its peers tracked by   Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 3.04% gain as the   S&P 500 rose 1.56%. The fund topped 49% of its direct   rivals over the past year. It beat 90% of its peer group   over the past 10 years.;During the fund's year-to-date romp, best performing   investments included such top holdings as social media giant;Facebook;(;FB;), with a good 90 Composite Rating from IBD, which is up   11% this year. The social network has entered the   enterprise software market with a business collaboration suite   called Workplace. Workplace is a challenge to a lot of   intraoffice email.

Information technology was   the fund's largest sector as of Dec. 31, with a 31% weighting.   Consumer discretionary was next with a 21% weighting.;In addition to Facebook and Alphabet, tech-oriented holdings   included;Apple;(;AAPL;) and;Amazon;(AMZN) among top holdings as of Nov. 30.;Broadcom;(AVGO) and;Applied Materials;(AMAT) were two additional tech names.;Broadcom is on IBD's Leaderboard.

One key reason is Broadcom's three quarters in a row of   accelerating sales and earnings growth.

Investors are ignoring the critics, who point out that the cash burn and debt levels are less than ideal.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Via Netflix;NFLX's asset is its original programming. But that's a double edged sword. On the one hand, it's the carrot that is the magnet for subs. On the other hand, it's a costly proposition that is the source of the financial criticism.;Technically, we've noted the upside potential in NFLX stock when we wrote about;streaming profits for free;just two weeks ago. The trade is a complete win and can be booked for profits. While I can't argue with the notion that Netflix has its financial stresses, I can't get on board with a complete collapse.;NFLX will have fierce competition from the likes of;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;).

Should I Buy Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;January 19, 2017, 10:24:52 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;The mission at;Whole Foods Market, Inc;. (NASDAQ:;WFM;) is to focus on a healthy lifestyle, but for WFM shareholders, the experience has not been so healthy. Since Whole Foods stock hit an all-time high in late 2013, the shares have been cut in half.;Source:;Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified);This is another example of a former Wall Street darling that has not able to live up to exuberant expectations.;"makeArticleAd();";But then again, there are certainly plenty of cases of turnarounds, right? Just look at;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) and;Starbucks Corporation;(NASDAQ:;SBUX;). There was a time when few had any confidence in their abilities either.;In fact, when a company goes into a slump, there are actually advantages. Management has more incentive to make bold changes and try new innovations.;So perhaps we will see a comeback with Whole Foods stock? Or perhaps the problems will take a lot longer to cure? Let's take a look at three pros and cons:;WFM Stock Pros;Pioneer and Leader in Organic Foods:;WFM got its start back in the late 1970s, when the industry for organic foods was in the nascent stages. But co-founder John Mackey wanted his company to be the dominant player in the industry. Part of this was a savvy marketing strategy focused on women. But there was also an aggressive M&A campaign - bolstered with an IPO in the early 1990s - to consolidate smaller players.;"10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's     ""America First"" Plans";As of now, WFM is the largest natural and organic foods grocery operator in the U.S. and the No. 5 publicly traded food retailer. There are 456 locations, which attract more than 8 million customer visits per week.;What's more, Whole Foods has been making new efforts to expand its model, such as with 365 by Whole Foods Markets. Launched in 2016, this is a small format store that focuses on value pricing. Right now, WFM is in the experimentation phase. But if 365 by Whole Foods Markets gets traction, it could greatly expand the market opportunity for the company.;Attractive Market:;The market for healthy foods is massive. According to;TechSci Research;, the spending on organic products is currently at about $45 billion in the U.S., and the growth is forecasted at 16% per year until 2020.;This should not be surprise. The fact is that consumers demand healthier offerings. But there is also concerns about sustainability and the environmental impact of business practices.;As Mackey noted on the recent;earnings call:;"""At the same time, the market opportunity is expanding as the consciousness about fresh healthy foods continues to awaken. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and the culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever. And where our company is today is just a shadow of where we think it will be in the future.""";M&A Bait:;The grocery space continues to see lots of dealmaking. For example,;Apollo Global Management LLC;(NYSE:;APO;) purchased Fresh Market for;$1.4 billion;and;Onex Corporation;(OTCMKTS:;ONEXF;) paid $1.4 billion for Save-A-Lot.;But there is more pressure on large grocery operators, like;Kroger Co;(NYSE:;KR;), to get more acquisitive since growth continues to remain slow. In other words, a deal for WFM would greatly expand a company's footprint, allow for cost synergies and also provide more diverse product offerings in the organics market.;WFM Stock Cons;Competition;: Again, the market for healthy foods is likely to see lots of growth. But of course, this has resulted in fierce competition. Mega operators like;Wal-Mart Stores, Inc;(NYSE:;WMT;), KR,;Target Corporation;(NYSE:;TGT;) and;Costco Wholesale Corporation;(NASDAQ:;COST;) have made an aggressive play for the opportunity. And while their offerings may not necessarily be at the quality of Whole Foods, this may not matter too much. The fact is that consumers also want to get a good value for their grocery shopping.;"No doubt, WFM has a reputation of being about the ""Whole Paycheck."" Granted, this may be a bit of an exaggeration. But then again, surveys do show that WFM still is on the pricey side. For example, according to analysts at";Wedbush Securities;, the company has prices that are roughly 15% more expensive compared to traditional grocers in various key markets.;E-Commerce & Disruption:;Venture capitalists are showing interest in the healthy foods space. To this end, these firms are funding startups that provide new approaches like home delivery and premade packages.;Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Outshine the     Snapchat IPO;Just look at Thrive Market, which is an online grocer of organic foods. For this year, the company projects sales of;$130 million;, up from $50 million in 2015. Thrive also recently raised $111 million.;As for WFM stock, it has taken a partnership strategy, such as relying on Instacart for deliveries. However, according to a report from Barclays, the service is;29% more expensive compared to Thrive;.;Of course, Whole Foods has more than just startups to worry about. There are also the large traditional internet operators, especially;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;).;Valuation/Financials:;Even with the drop in WFM stock, the valuation is still far from cheap. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is 21X. By comparison, KR and WMT trade at about 15X.;Yet it could be tough for WFM to sustain the valuation since the company's growth has been anemic. For the current fiscal year, the company expects same-store sales to be 0% to -2%, with overall sales increasing anywhere from 2.5% to 4.5%.;Bottom Line on Whole Foods Stock;It's encouraging that WFM is taking steps to innovate, such as with 365 by Whole Foods Markets. But this initiative is still in the early stages and will take time to move the needle.;In the meantime, WFM must fight intense competition from traditional retailers and there is also pressure from online startups. Overall, it's going to be tough for the company to get back into the growth phase.;So should you buy Whole Foods stock? For now, it's best to avoid this one.;Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog;IPO Playbook;and is a registered investment adviser representative (you   can;visit his site;to learn more about his financial planning services).;He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.;Follow him on Twitter at;@ttaulli;.

General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Rise On … Rail Power?;January 19, 2017, 09:12:46 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;By all accounts,;General Electric Company;(NYSE:;GE;") should be getting out of the railroad business, rather than deeper into it. CEO Jeffrey Immelt has spent the past several years paring divisions that didn't fit with his vision of making GE stock a pure ""digital industrial"" investment.";Source: Shutterstock;He divested the bulk of its finance business in 2015, for example, and he sold the appliance business to;Haier Group;early last year. Meanwhile, 2016's rail traffic continued to deteriorate compared to 2015's levels, leaving everyone wondering if things could get any worse for railroading in 2017.;"makeArticleAd();";So when General Electric announced in December that it was going to;acquire train-technology company;Ider;"to bring its ""self aware"" train technology in-house";, some owners of GE stock were left scratching their heads.;The railroad industry appears to be dying. And this sliver of GE's transportation arm;pulls in less than $6 billion in revenue per year;. If anything, Immelt should want to get out of this distracting, unfruitful business as well, right?;As it turns out, there may be a method to the madness.;Railroads' Worst Is Behind Them;For perspective, rail traffic in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico was mostly down in 2016, following a lackluster 2015. The implosion of commodity prices and drying-up demand for coal and oil, in particular, were key contributing factors.;The Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Safety in     2017;So far in 2017, we've seen some stability in rail traffic, even a little growth. That modest rebound arguably even began in 2016, when commodity prices finally perked up. Still, it's tough to be too optimistic about rail freight.;General Electric's interest in next-generation railroading, though, may actually make a lot of sense.;In Railway Age's rail outlook for 2017;, Jason Seidl opined:;"""Year-over-year carloadings are looking better for the railroad group, with much of it due to easier prior-year comparisons. Growth in agricultural products and less of a coal traffic decline have also helped. Looking out to 2017, we have hopes for volume growth to return to the industry, albeit at a low-single-digit pace …";We believe the pending deadline for electronic logging devices (ELDs), coupled with fleet reductions in 2016 by many carriers, will limit capacity as 2017 progresses …;"Coal traffic, while not expected to show a sharp rebound, should not be nearly the drag it was for the industry in 2016.""";In other words, things can only get better from here. And a pro-business, anti-regulation President Trump is likely to not only spur economic activity, but ultimately lower rail operating costs.;It was something Tom Simpson said within the outlook, though, that should really resonate with GE stock holders. He explains:;"""What will help the industry survive the current downturn? Class I executives are looking to technology and an improved, more-focused quality process …";"Our industry has always bounced back from economic downturns, as in the early 2000s and the early 2010s. We may see a different rebound this time, fueled by technology, innovation and continuous quality improvement.""";He's right. And it just so happens that General Electric upped the ante on technological innovations for the rail-freight industry.;Ider in Focus;With all of this perspective in hand, the acquisition of Ider suddenly makes a lot more sense.;GE Transportation President and CEO Jamie Miller;said of the deal;:;"""This strategic acquisition marks another milestone for GE Transportation in creating an efficient, self-aware rail ecosystem that helps customers achieve smarter outcomes made possible by sensor data and analytics. This acquisition puts GE in the driver's seat, allowing for faster innovation and scale, digital breakthroughs and future enhancements by in-house talent.""";Though it's still not entirely clear what, if anything, GE will add or subtract to Ider to make it and its current rail transportation business more marketable, it is clear that the rail industry is beginning to enter the digital age. At the very least, a connected locomotive (and presumably rail cars, too) will make railroads and their customers more efficient simply by giving them more information as to the status of a delivery, and tools to better manage that freight.;Sell Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Buy Microsoft     Corporation (MSFT) Stock;If this concept seems vaguely familiar, it may be because it's a shadow of the broader advent of the internet of things, and perhaps more specifically to General Electric, a way to integrate rail traffic and its;nascent but fast-growing IoT platform called Predix;.;It could be the edge railroads need to attract new customers, or re-attract lost customers.;Rail freight is already the most fuel- and cost-efficient means of transporting goods;. It's just so much easier to have a tractor trailer bring goods right to your door.;Ider's technology may well change that reality.;Bottom Line for GE Stock;The expansion of GE's tiny rail division won't be a game-changer for the company. The GE dividend of 23 cents per share of won't be catapulted higher, nor will earnings soar as the company revolutionizes rail freight … directly.;"But if General Electric makes a move to meld Ider's technology with other pieces of its ""digital industrial"" mission, the behemoth of a company becomes more of a one-stop solutions provider.";In other words, the rail division will never be a big piece of the revenue pie, but look beyond the superficial numbers. This acquisition and implementation could make GE's other ventures more marketable 10 and even 20 years into the future.;It may well rekindle railroad stocks, too.;As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for     Retirement;10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print     Money;The Ultra-Cheap Portfolio: 3 Schwab ETFs for     2017;The post;General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Rise On … Rail Power?;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.

Does This Apple, Inc. Stock Recovery Have Legs?;January 19, 2017, 09:00:00 AM EDT;AAPL;data by;YCharts;.;Following a lackluster 2016 that saw;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) just;barely;squeeze out some outperformance relative to the;S&P 500;, shares now seem to be recovering from the negativity. It's   worth noting that Apple did spend much of last year   underperforming the market, including the final months of the   year. The Mac maker only pulled ahead in the last couple weeks.   Shares are now trading in the ballpark of $120, levels not seen   through;all;of 2016.;"makeArticleAd();";Investing is a forward-looking endeavor, so the real question   is: Does this recovery have legs and will shares continue higher,   or will shares gyrate lower and we're now just seeing the top of   range-bound trading?;Why 2016 was so tough;Last year marked the first time that Apple posted   year-over-year declines in iPhone unit sales, both on quarterly   bases as well as for the full fiscal year. Considering the   importance of the iPhone to Apple's financials, that's an   incredibly tough storyline to beat. Apple investors in particular   are known to be an emotional bunch, and investor sentiment is a   function of emotion. It also didn't help that Apple Watch --   along with the broader smartwatch market -- is already suffering   from weak demand and likely year-over-year declines in unit   sales, too.;The iPhone 7 was not a game changer. Image source: Apple.;"The skepticism only fueled the idea that Tim Cook's Apple   can't innovate in the same way that Steve Jobs' Apple could. Just   this week, a former Apple engineer argued that Cook changed   ""Apple from a dynamic change-maker into a boring operations   company,"" among other critical comments about Apple's direction   and ability to innovate.";I'd agree that Apple is a lot more boring these days, but I   don't think focusing on operations is necessarily a bad thing.   Execution and operations are intimately linked, and don't forget   how nearly all of Apple's pertinent operating metrics --   including;iPhone unit sales and revenue;, among many others -- have skyrocketed under Cook's leadership.   Those gains are more attributable to strong execution than   revolutionary new products.;It's hard to see shares rising much from here;"Don't get me wrong; I've long been the Fool's resident Apple   perma-bull, and Apple remains one of my largest holdings. But in   my opinion, it seems likely that Apple shares will remain   range-bound and we may simply be near the top of that range. I've   noted a";significant disconnect;between the buy-side and the sell-side, which I attribute to poor   investor sentiment on the part of the buy-side. The sell-side has   less skin in the game, and lofty price targets are often derived   by using comparable peer valuation multiples.;If;Apple stock;is to really rise meaningfully from here, the company;has;to overcome the prevailing perception that it has lost its   innovative touch, which would subsequently inspire investor   confidence. Maybe then the market will price in higher valuation   multiples. The problem is that disproving the skeptics takes a   long time. And lacking any revolutionary breakthrough products in   the short-term pipeline (i.e., in 2017), the company doesn't have   many other ways to prove them wrong.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Buys Twitter's Platform for Developers;January 19, 2017, 08:21:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();";Alphabet Inc.;GOOGL;owned Google has decided to acquire Twitter Inc's;TWTR;mobile app developer platform Fabric. Google however did not say how much it will pay for Fabric.;Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the Zacks;Internet Services;industry. It has gained 15.37% compared to the industry's gain of 15.36%.;Fabric that includes popular tools like Crashlytics crash reporting system, Fastlane development automation system, Answers mobile app analytics and Digits SMS login system will be absorbed into Google's Developer Products division and form a part of its Firebase (the company's cloud-based mobile software tool) business.;Twitter's vice president of product management and Fabric head Jeff Seibet announced in a tweet that Rich Paret, Fabric's vice president of engineering & GM will helm Fabric after the transition. Google will retain the entire Fabric team.;Since its inception in 2014, Fabric's tools have been pretty popular and Twitter claims that the platform has served more than 580,000 developers, backing apps on nearly 2.5 million mobile devices.;How is Alphabet Poised to Benefit?;We believe that the acquisition will help Google build Firebase into a wider developer platform so that it could be pitted against similar offerings from Facebook;FB;.;Fabric can also help Google to take developers away from Apple;AAPL;. Fabric is popular with developers of Apple's iOS and Google is now in a position to make them develop apps for its Android software and mobile app.;Additionally, Google will be getting Fabric's mobile developers who have the much needed talent for cloud computing service.;Alphabet Inc.

Recently, the company phased out its six-second video service Vine and replaced it with Vine Camera that no longer hosts videos. It has also trimmed down 9% of its workforce.;We believe that the latest move from Twitter is an effort to shed its non-core assets and revitalize the slow growing social media site.;To Conclude;Alphabet has been making a large number of acquisitions.

TiVo Corp. (TIVO) Faces Stiff Competition: Should You Dump?;January 19, 2017, 07:55:00 AM EDT;Do you still have shares of;TiVo Corporation;TIVO;in your portfolio? If yes, then this is the best time to dump the stock as chances of favorable returns in the near term are slim.;"makeArticleAd();";In fact, the stock has gained just 9% in the past one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized;Internet Services;industry, which has witnessed a gain of 15.4%. Let's delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company down.;Growth Impediments;Intense competition is eroding TiVo's subscriber base. The company faces increasing competition from cable and satellite providers, who offer bundled up DVR service with digital cable in one set-top box at comparable monthly subscription rates and without any upfront costs. It faces significant competition from a number of companies, which have created competing DVR technologies and offer attractive licensing agreements to service providers and manufacturers of DVRs, thereby leaving little to no scope for differentiation. The company is also facing significant competition from Alphabet Inc.;GOOGL;TV, Roku and Apple;AAPL;TV.;The current challenging economic environment and intense competition in the DVR business have made operations more difficult. As a result, TiVo has been increasing its research and development (R&D) spending to stay ahead of the competition, which will continue to hurt its profitability, going forward.;The merger of TiVo and Rovi Corp. has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry with complementary products and services as well as a number of patented technologies. The new TiVo Corporation has now become the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. However, the actual synergies from the merger will take some time to reflect on the company's performance and much depends on the successful integration of TiVo's legacy business.;Estimates Moving South;Estimates for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 have moved south in the past 30 days. The company's fiscal 2016 earnings estimates moved down by 43 cents to $1.23 per share. Similarly for fiscal 2017, earnings estimates moved down by 65 cents to $1.39 per share. Given its weak fundamentals and an unfavorable Zacks Rank, it is likely to keep underperforming in the quarters ahead.;Low Return;Given the other unattractive features like low return on equity (ROE) and low return on assets (ROA), the stock looks very unappealing. TiVo currently trades at a ROE of 13.6%, much lower than the industry average of 23.6%. Notably, the company has an ROA of 6.7% compared with the industry average of 11.2%. Return on capital (ROC) of 7.7% is also lower than the industry average of 16.2%.;Last Word;"The stock has Zacks Style Score of ""D"" in Momentum, ""D"" in Value and ""C"" in Growth.  The stock has a VGM Style Score of ""C"".. So, if a stock you're in slips to Style Score of D, C or F, it's better to sell that stock and switch to a new one with a Style Score of A or B.";We expect the aforementioned factors to hurt the company's near-term profitability. Hence, we recommend investors to stay away from TiVo shares until its Zacks Rank, VGM score and estimates improve.;Stock to Consider;A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Seagate Technology plc;STX;, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Sell Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock;January 19, 2017, 06:03:11 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) is boring,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is exciting. That's been the narrative on Wall Street for years, but the results don't match the narrative.;Source:;Johannes Marliem Via Flickr;Over the past five years, MSFT stock has risen 120%, an average annual return of 24%. Apple stock, despite grabbing far more headlines and gaining greater attention for its products, has risen 98%, or just under 20% annually, during that time.;"makeArticleAd();";When you factor in the dividends - Microsoft yields 2.5% and has nearly doubled its payout in the past five years, Apple yields 1.9% and has only been paying a dividend since 2012 - the gap between the two stocks is even wider.;In fairness, the peaks in Apple's stock have been much greater than those in the Microsoft stock price, but MSFT has been a steady, reliable grower with equally reliable dividend growth. Therein, perhaps, lies the difference between the two stocks.;MSFT Now a Dividend, Value Stock;Its days of regular double-digit sales and earnings growth long behind it, Microsoft stock has instead become the technology stock of choice for income investors and value investors (it trades at just 19 times forward earnings estimates) alike. AAPL, on the other hand, is still searching for an identity now that it's no longer the unstoppable growth stock it was five years ago.;5 Chinese Internet Stocks With Long-Term     Potential;Even though Apple's dividend is growing and its yield respectable, and the stock has become much cheaper (forward price-earnings of 11.8) than MSFT, Wall Street still views AAPL as a growth stock. But the company is no longer growing, as reflected by three straight quarters of sales declines.;"Microsoft's sales aren't growing either, down nearly 9% last year. But profits are improving, and are expected to increase again next year. And what Microsoft lacks in ""wow"" factor it makes up for in solid business decisions.";For instance, the company's foray into cloud computing has been a major growth driver. Its Azure cloud computing platform, where applications can be developed and managed via a global network of Microsoft-controlled data centers, has posted triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters, making it easily the company's fastest-growing segment.;Microsoft also just finalized its $26.2 billion acquisition of;LinkedIn Corp;(NYSE:;LNKD;);.;And while that's a hefty price to pay for a social media company whose impact on Microsoft's bottom line could be minimal, it's a sign of the company's financial clout - even after the LinkedIn buyout, MSFT still has $136.8 billion of cash ($17.59 per share) in its coffers. Plus, buying a social media site that a lot of people know and use is a good way to stay relevant and at the forefront of investors' minds.;Then there's the Cortana, Microsoft's lesser known answer to;Amazon.com, Inc.'s;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) Alexa. It's a digital personal assistant for anyone with a Windows 10 device. While the Alexa grabbed all the headlines at this month's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas because of its new automaker partnerships, Microsoft announced a deal of its own with Nissan to install Cortana on its car dashboards.;So, while Microsoft's products often get overshadowed by Amazon's (whether it's the Alexa over the Cortana, or Amazon Web Services over the Azure), there are plenty of catalysts for growth here. And Microsoft stock has already been growing just fine, thank you.;Bottom Line on MSFT and AAPL Stock;Apple stock had a nice bounce-back year in 2016, too. But that came on the heels of a bad 2015, and AAPL's future catalysts are less defined amid a seemingly endless cycle of iPhone and iPad updates.;Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Going to     $80 in 2017;Some analysts have speculated that Apple is on its way to becoming the next Microsoft, a company whose best days are behind it. But MSFT peaked 17 years ago, and the company has since settled into a slower-growth, under-the-radar, shareholder-friendly identity that has worked well for it.;It could take a while for AAPL to adapt to its new slower-growth reality. In the meantime, I'd buy MSFT stock.;As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;10 Companies That Should Be in the Dow     Jones;The Ultra-Cheap Portfolio: 3 Schwab ETFs for     2017;The post;Sell Apple Inc.

Is This Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Rumor True?;January 18, 2017, 09:14:00 PM EDT;On;Twitter;, user Arkthub sent me a link to a forum post containing an   interesting rumor about a key component inside of;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) 2017 smartphone lineup. The forum post, which   appears to have originally shown up on website;TheLayoff.com;, essentially says the following:;Apple won't use;Intel;'s(NASDAQ: INTC) upcoming XMM 7480 cellular modem in the     next-generation iPhone for several reasons, which essentially     boil down to the fact that the 7480 is technologically inferior     to competing solutions.;Apple will instead use;Qualcomm;'s(NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon X12 modem as well as the follow-on     to the XMM 7480, known as the XMM 7560.;Although on the surface this rumor might seem reasonable, it   doesn't quite make sense upon further thought.;The XMM 7560 probably won't be ready;Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has made it clear that the company   intends to release new stand-alone cellular modems at an annual   clip. Intel began shipping the 7360 during the second quarter of   2016, so it makes sense that the follow-on to 7360, which Intel   calls the XMM 7480, will begin shipping in the second quarter of   2017 -- just in time for Apple's next-generation iPhone models   (if Intel wins the spots, that is).;"makeArticleAd();";Image source: Apple.;It seems very unlikely that Intel would have the follow-on to   the XMM 7480, known as the XMM 7560, ready for commercial   deployment in time for the iPhone 8 launch. After all, if the XMM   7560 were going to be all set for commercial deployments just a   year after the XMM 7360 shipped, then wouldn't it make sense for   Intel to just cancel the XMM 7480 altogether?;So, at the very least, this part of the rumor doesn't appear   to be likely.;What modems will be inside of the next iPhone, then?;The following is pure speculation on my part -- there haven't   been many leaks about the next-generation iPhones, particularly   with respect to the individual components and suppliers thereof   that will be in the phones.;However, key Apple supplier;Broadcom;(NASDAQ: AVGO) , which supplies radio frequency (RF) and Wi-Fi   connectivity components for Apple's iPhones, has indicated on   several occasions that it expects to enjoy dollar-content   increases in successive iPhone generations.;Increased RF content suggests enhanced wireless capabilities,   which not only helps Broadcom's business, but also tells us that   cellular modem upgrades are probably on the way.;The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus use either Intel's XMM 7360 or   Qualcomm's Snapdragon X12 - depending on the model. The   Snapdragon X12 is more capable than the XMM 7360, but Apple   appears to be;artificially restricting;the capabilities of the former to ensure parity of wireless   specifications of both.;Image source: Qualcomm.;One hypothesis that I've put out there in the past is that   Apple could deliver better wireless capabilities in its rumored   OLED iPhone model compared to the capabilities found in the more   mainstream models. In that case, I could see Apple using   Qualcomm's Snapdragon X16 modem (i.e., gigabit-class LTE) in the   OLED model, and then sticking with the X12 or using the Intel XMM   7480 in the other ones.;"The X12 would, once again, need to be ""sandbagged"" to bring it   to parity with the XMM 7480 (the X12 supports up to 600 megabits   per second download speeds; the 7480 supports just 450 megabits   per second).";We'll know more in about eight months when Apple formally   unveils its next generation iPhone models.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Is This What's Held Back Apple, Inc.'s Cellular Baseband Ambitions?;January 18, 2017, 07:13:00 PM EDT;You won't find an integrated baseband in the A10 Fusion chip.   Image source: Apple.;"""There is no stand-alone modem business anymore.""";"makeArticleAd();";That's;NVIDIA;CEO Jen-Hsun Huang from a conference call way back in;2013;, when the company was developing a Tegra mobile processor with   an integrated baseband modem to challenge;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) . The baseband market had been shifting toward   integrated solutions for years, and Qualcomm was by far the   technological leader with integrated cellular connectivity.   Integration provides significant benefits in costs and power   efficiency relative to stand-alone modems.;Yet, here we are in 2017 and;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) is;still;using stand-alone baseband modems. The Mac maker had been   exclusively sourcing modems from Qualcomm for about five years,   and only recently added;Intel;to the mix as a second supplier. But over the years as Apple's   own chip ambitions grew with its A-chips, this question has   lingered: Why hasn't Apple integrated cellular connectivity into   A-chips? We know the company places high value on power   efficiency, which directly affects battery life.;The answer may potentially lie in the FTC's recent;anticompetitive complaint;(link opens PDF) against Qualcomm.;[Redacted] = Apple?;While the complaint has an entire section dedicated to   Qualcomm's relationship with Apple, and all the ways Qualcomm   leveraged its baseband supplier relationship to score   exclusivity, the second charge is that Qualcomm consistently   refused to license its standards-essential patents (SEPs) to   competitors at fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND)   rates, contrary to its commitments.;For smartphone OEMs that it supplies basebands to, Qualcomm   has incredible leverage since any disruption in baseband supply   could cripple their ability to make mobile devices. But for   competing suppliers where Qualcomm lacks that leverage, licensing   SEPs enables competition. Things get a little murkier when you   talk about vertically integrated companies that are both   customers;and;competitors. Samsung comes to mind as a prominent customer of   Qualcomm chips as well as a maker of applications processors and   baseband processors.;Apple has long been a customer, and common sense suggests it   should also have been interested in licensing Qualcomm's SEPs in   order to integrate cellular connectivity into its own chips. Over   the years, there's been tons of;evidence;that Apple is;building its own wireless chips;.;"Naturally, Qualcomm wouldn't want to lose Apple's baseband   business; did Qualcomm refuse to license its SEPs to the iPhone   maker? What if Apple is the redacted company from this part of   the complaint?";"In breach of its FRAND commitments, at odds with its     recognition that other industry participants ""will require"" a     license to its FRAND-encumbered SEPs, and in tension with its     practice of securing patent licenses for the benefit of its own     customers, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license its     SEPs to competing suppliers of baseband processors. Several of     Qualcomm's former and current competitors, including Intel,";[redacted];, and Samsung, have sought SEP licenses from Qualcomm. In each     instance, Qualcomm refused to grant a SEP license.;You might not consider Apple a competitor to Qualcomm, but it   very much is, particularly as its chip engineering teams have   ballooned in recent years. Apple designs many competing   semiconductors, even if it doesn't sell them to other companies   and just uses them in its own products. Qualcomm competes for   Apple's business against Apple's own chip teams.;Refusing to license SEPs to Apple could be the perfect answer   to the question that's been bothering me for years, since that   would easily explain why Apple has yet to integrate cellular   connectivity. Apple simply can't risk losing access to Qualcomm's   modems, since the iPhone accounts for two-thirds of sales.;"And it's not as if Apple could quickly ditch Qualcomm   basebands in favor of its own A-chips with integrated cellular   connectivity; it would take years for Apple to design and develop   even after scoring a SEP license and it would need basebands in   the interim. That's not a transition that Qualcomm would be   supportive of, as granting Apple a SEP license would merely lay   the foundation for Apple eventually ditching Qualcomm's   basebands.";As a result, Apple has quietly endured Qualcomm's demands for   the past five years.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

Apple Stock Hits $120: Is It Still a Buy?;January 18, 2017, 07:05:00 PM EDT;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has been on quite the tear recently, rising   21.5% in the past six months and easily outperforming the S&P   500's 5% gain during the same period. After setting a new 52-week   high in January, the stock closed Wednesday's trading session one   cent shy of a nice, round $120.;With;Apple stock;trading higher, is it;still;a;buy;? I think so. Here's why:;"makeArticleAd();";Image source: Getty Images.;1. Apple stock's valuation remains     conservative;Even after Apple stock's nice increase over the past six   months, it still trades at a significant discount. On average,   S&P 500 companies have a price-to-earnings ratio of about 25.   Apple's P/E is just 14.4.;Further, Apple stock's valuation is particularly cheap when   considering its price relative to its underlying free cash flow,   or the cold, hard excess cash Apple's business generates that can   be used for future capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends,   and share repurchases. Apple stock trades at just 12.2 times free   cash flow -- a valuation that essentially assumes Apple's free   cash flow per share will remain at current levels.;In other words, since Apple stock is already priced for the   headwinds impeding its growth to stick around, investors have a   good chance of earning a meaningful return on their investments   over the long haul even if Apple never finds a way to grow its   top or bottom line. All Apple has to do is maintain its current   levels of profitability.;2. Worries are still overblown;Of course, there's good reason for Apple's conservative   valuation. Year-over-year revenue declines in the company's   iPhone segment recently have been weighing heavily on the tech   giant's results. The device accounts for over 60% of the   company's trailing-12-month revenue, so a tough year for iPhone   ensures the company's overall results will suffer, too.;Data for chart retrieved from Apple SEC filings for quarter's   shown. Apple's fiscal quarters are used. Char source: Author.;On the other hand, while it makes sense for investors to view   this negative trend with skepticism, the doom-and-gloom   narratives about Apple's prospects are overblown. For instance,   the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sparked a monster upgrade   cycle for Apple as consumers gobbled up the first iPhone with a   phablet-sized screen, which meant Apple's fiscal 2016 was up   against some very tough annual comparisons. Already, Apple is   guiding for its year-over-year revenue comparisons to improve in   2017. The company expects its first-quarter revenue to be   slightly higher than in the year-ago quarter.;Further, it's easy to imagine iPhone sales returning to growth   when the company overhauls the device's form factor with its   inevitable next redesign -- something that could occur as early   as this year.;Also, other Apple segments, or even future new products, could   surprise the market. The tech giant's services segment is;already looking promising;, and investors can take comfort in the fact that any new   products would launch to a very loyal customer base thanks to the   Apple's brand power.;Image source: Apple.;3. Apple is a great dividend stock;Last, even if the company struggles to grow its revenue -- or   even its bottom line -- the stock is an excellent dividend   investment. Sure, Apple's dividend yield of 1.9% may not be   impressive, but its starts looking tasty when investors consider   the company has been increasing the dividend at a rate of about   11% annually, and it is only paying out 23% of its free cash flow   in dividends. Going forward, therefore, there's no reason why   Apple couldn't continue increasing its dividend at a rate of   about 11% annually for the foreseeable future. At that rate,   Apple's dividend would;double in about 7 years;.;So, yes: Even at $120, I'm still betting on Apple stock.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they       have run for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of       them!

Regulators Accuse Qualcomm of 3 Shady Practices;January 18, 2017, 03:37:00 PM EDT;Image source: Getty Images.;Following;rumors;, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) officially charged mobile   chip giant;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM)  with anti-competitive behavior last night,   which was the culmination of an investigation that kicked off in   2014. Qualcomm has long enjoyed a cushy spot smack dab in the   middle of the mobile value chain. Both of its business segments   -- chips and licensing -- dominate mobile devices in different   and highly complementary ways. The company is by far the top dog   in mobile baseband processors (the modems that allow mobile   devices to connect to cell networks) and licensing of   standards-essential patents (SEPs) for telecommunications. While   that incredibly strong position is also a crucial part of the   investing thesis, the FTC thinks the company went too far.;"makeArticleAd();";Here are the three primary charges of anticompetitive   practices that regulators are alleging.;"""No license, no chips""";"Since licensing agreements are negotiated on a case-by-case   basis, the FTC alleges that Qualcomm used its chip supplier   relationship to force handset original equipment manufacturers   (OEMs) into agreeing to onerous terms and ""elevated royalties.""   These terms would often include higher royalty rates when OEMs   purchase baseband processors from competitors. Regulators refer   to this as Qualcomm's ""no license, no chips"" policy.";"If OEMs weren't willing to agree to these terms, Qualcomm   would withhold its baseband chips and not sell them to the   manufacturer, according to the complaint. This utterly cripples   an OEM's ability to produce mobile devices, since the baseband is   such a crucial component and without it the device can't connect   to cell networks. Qualcomm has a lot of leverage here, and it   knows it. By charging elevated royalties when OEMs purchased from   rivals, Qualcomm was effectively creating what the FTC   characterizes as a ""tax"" on OEMs for using competing   products.";"Qualcomm's supplier relationship also hurt OEMs' ability to   challenge the royalty rates in court. The company charges a   royalty rate based on the sale price, but this may be   inappropriate since modern mobile devices have evolved to include   a plethora of features beyond cellular connectivity. Absent the   ""no license, no chips"" policy, OEMs would likely argue that   Qualcomm's technological contributions comprise a smaller   proportion of a device's value. Most OEMs never challenged the   rates due to the risk of losing access to Qualcomm's chips.";Chipmakers was no FRAND to competitors;SEPs must be available to license, even to competitors, at   fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates. Qualcomm   has committed to FRAND licensing, but the FTC believes it   breached these commitments and refused to license its SEPs to   large peers like;Intel;and;Samsung;.;"The regulators note that while Qualcomm has significant   leverage over OEMs thanks to the threat of supply chain   disruption, it has no such leverage with rivals looking to sell   competing baseband processors. As such, Qualcomm simply chooses   not to license to rivals. Additionally, if it did license SEPs to   rivals, those rates would be fairer than those it extracts from   OEMs; the possibility that those lower rates become known could   establish additional data points for ""reasonable"" royalties,   which would hurt its negotiations with OEMs.";Holding Apple hostage;Apple;"(NASDAQ: AAPL) had been sourcing basebands exclusively from   Qualcomm for years, and now we may know why. It might not have   just been superior technology. The Mac maker reportedly finds   Qualcomm's royalties ""inconsistent with Qualcomm's FRAND   commitments"" and has previously attempted to reduce its royalty   burden with different agreements in 2007, 2011, and 2013.";The 2007 agreement provided some relief in the form of royalty   rebates, but only if Apple did not introduce a WiMAX iPhone. If   you recall, a decade ago LTE and WiMAX competed to become the   accepted standard for 4G. LTE won out, and Apple's aversion to   WiMAX certainly didn't help WiMAX's odds. Qualcomm doesn't hold a   lot of WiMAX patents relative to LTE, so if WiMAX had won,   Qualcomm's licensing business would have suffered.;"The 2011 and 2013 agreements were exclusivity agreements,   where Qualcomm would pay ""substantial incentive payments"" to   retain exclusivity in supplying basebands for all new iPhones and   iPads. The 2013 agreement also included a condition that Apple   not question the royalty rates as violating FRAND commitments.   We're talking about ""billions of dollars in conditional rebates""   that Qualcomm paid to keep its cushy spot.";Qualcomm responds;Naturally, Qualcomm is;defending itself;and believes the charges lack merit. The company's general   counsel has issued a statement (which can be seen in full at;Tech Trader Daily;), believing that the FTC is rushing to file the complaint before   the new Trump administration takes power.;Of the current three commissioners, one has already resigned,   another is on their way out, and the third dissented with the   complaint. There's a chance that the new administration and/or   commissioners appointed by Trump won't take the complaint   seriously, given Trump's harsh stance on regulation. Shares are   up modestly today, so it seems investors are optimistic about the   outcome.;10 stocks we like better than Qualcomm;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of     them!

Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL AR, AMZN Card, Waymo Tech, YHOO;January 18, 2017, 03:21:00 PM EDT;Top news last week included Apple's;AAPL;augmented reality glasses, Amazon's;AMZN;credit card, Waymo's self driving system and Yahoo's;YHOO;name change.;Apple AR;Tech journalist Robert Scoble has unleashed a rumor that Apple is in partnership with German luxury brand Karl Zeiss AG to make augmented reality smart glasses. He also says that the glasses may be launched this year or the next although Apple's supply chain orders indicate that it is not ready to get into mass production just yet.;Tim Cook has made frequent comments about the AR opportunity saying that he considered it a much bigger market than VR and also that Apple continued to invest in it. Augmented reality is different from virtual reality in that it doesn't totally immerse you in another world but allows you to mix real word situations with digital objects.;"It might be just the thing to watch TV and other shows handsfree, without the need to flip a switch or surf channels. You could simply tap the Airpods and say, ""Hey Siri…"", sit back and relax. Not that Apple's said anything to that effect, but it is going after original programming, so…";Amazon Credit Card;Amazon has partnered with Chase to launch the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card that credits Prime members an amount equal to 5% of their purchases on Amazon. They will also get 2% back on purchases at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores and 1% back on other purchases. The credit can be used to make further purchases on Amazon.;Holders of the existing Amazon card, if they are also Prime members, will be automatically upgraded to the new card. If a Prime member doesn't renew the subscription, they will be changed back to the old card that offers a 3% credit on Amazon purchases only.;Alphabet Makes Changes At Waymo;Alphabet;GOOGL;regained some spotlight for driverless car technology at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Its recently-spun-out Waymo has developed a Lidar-based sensor system that it will be selling auto makers. The main challenge in using the technology has been the cost, which at around $75K, significantly adds to the cost of the vehicle.;Waymo CEO John Krafcik thinks that since the company's technology reduces this cost to $7.5K or less, there are chances that adoption will pick up. Waymo has been testing its self-driving car technology the longest and says it has made notable improvements in the last few years. In 2015 for instance, its test drivers had to take over control once every 1,250 miles while today it's only required once every 5,000 miles.;Yahoo Post-Verizon Sale;If Yahoo manages to sell off its core assets to Verizon, the remaining assets comprising a 15% stake in Alibaba;BABA;"and a larger chunk of Yahoo Japan will become an investment company called Altaba (appears to be a way of saying ""alternative to Alibaba""). Altaba will have half the number of directors. Marissa Mayer and co-founder David Filo won't be part of the team.";Verizon hasn't confirmed that it will buy Yahoo after the hacking news came out and it could negotiate a lower price. It also hasn't said whether Mayer will continue to lead the Yahoo division after its takeover.;Company;Last  Week;Last 6 Months;AAPL;+0.94%;+20.20%;FB;+3.99%;+6.51%;GOOGL;+0.69%;+9.64%;MSFT;-0.22%;+15.53%;INTC;+0.85%;+5.13%;CSCO;-0.53%;+0.84%;AMZN;+2.66%;+9.92%;What happened in the last week -;Corporate;Apple Director Moves to Tesla;: Chris Lattner, the 11-year old Apple veteran behind its Swift programming language is leaving the company. Lattner is joining Tesla as head of its Autopilot software unit. This follows Tesla's decision to double down on autonomous technology after one of its testing drivers were killed in a tragic accident. In Apple's case, things are also changing because the company laid off a large number of workers at Project Titan last year and invested a billion dollars in China's Didi Chuxing.;Fitbit to Launch Wearables App Store;: Fitbit;FIT;CEO James Park said at CES that the company will launch an app store this year. Not surprising given its intention of entering the smartwatch segment, where devices are priced higher but expected to have greater functionality. Its 2016 acquisition of struggling smartwatch maker Pebble will no doubt help since Pebble already had around 14K apps on its app store and had therefore already figured out some aspects of setting up a store.;Unlike Pebble, Fitbit continues to sign up corporate customers and also has a way for users to connect with each other. But an app store will build its ecosystem by bringing third party development effort. At any rate, the jury's still out on when the market will actually take off but it could be anywhere between three and five years.;MS Positive on Apple;: Morgan Stanley became the latest brokerage with a bullish call on Apple. The analyst Katy Huberty at MS sees the main reason for upside in the iPhone and expects the new AMOLED version to be a big driver of sales, led by China. The analyst said that Apple retains an 80% share of the high end segment and current softness in China wasn't an indicator of declining loyalty. It is instead attributable to the lack of a form factor change in the last upgrade cycle. Earlier, Goldman Sachs forwarded a positive view on Apple based on its strength in services and growing recurring revenue.;Facebook News Partnerships Head;: Facebook;FB;really needs to keep the media happy because it's an important source of content. At the same time, users are the life blood of a social platform and restricting user generated content can lead people to abandon the site and create bad publicity. So it needs to find middle ground, which is exactly why it has created a News Partnerships group. It has chosen Campbell Brown to head that group because of her previous experience as an anchor for NBC News and CNN and more recently, for her efforts around education reform.;Cisco Smart City Initiative in India;: Cisco, along with business process management and services provider Genpact, has announced a Global Center of Excellence in Jaipur, in Rajasthan state of India as part of its Lighthouse City project. The project is aligned with Prime Minister Modi's Digital India program. Accordingly, the MoU signed between the companies and the Government of Rajasthan requires Genpact to use Cisco Smart+Connected™ Digital Platform (CDP), Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences, and Cisco Video Surveillance Manager Solutions to develop analytics-driven technology applications.;Seagate Cuts China Jobs;: Seagate is reportedly shutting down its Suzhou, China facility, where it employs 2,127 people as part of a broad restructuring plan announced back in Jul 2016. The total plan involves consolidation of existing facilities across the Americas, Asia, EMEA and the reduction of total headcount by 6.5K or 14%. It followed another plan in June to take down 1.6K employees. As HDDs make way for SSDs, the two leading suppliers have reduced the amount of resources devoted to its manufacture. But while Western Digital also fortified its position with the acquisition of SanDisk, a leader in SSDs, Seagate is sticking with cost reductions for now.;Legal/Regulatory;Apple Antitrust Issues;: Apple's practice of allowing iPhones to run only those apps that were purchased from its App store has the effect of limiting competition and increasing prices of those apps. And since Apple takes a cut of whatever the apps earn, it directly benefits from the higher prices. This was the subject matter of a case filed back in 2012 when a lower court agreed with Apple's submission that it couldn't be sued in this case because users bought the apps from developers and not from Apple. Judge William A. Fletcher has said on appeal that users do buy directly from Apple, so they do have the right to sue. Apple is yet to comment.;New EU Privacy Rules;: The EU is looking to adopt privacy law that would require services like Google's Gmail, Facebook's social network and Messenger and Apple's iMessage to obtain explicit permission of users before tracking them with cookies or otherwise. They will also be required to keep their online activity confidential, meaning that even conversations that they are following can't be tracked without consent. This could have an immediate negative impact on ad revenue and impact the speed at which they develop artificial intelligence in the long term.;Facebook Fighting Oculus Lawsuit;": Video game company ZeniMax is saying that Oculus faked its origin story while enticing a key executive John Carmack to steal valuable code from Zenimax that he passed over to Oculus when he joined the company. Zenimax alleges that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey ""lacked the training, expertise, resources or know-how to create commercially viable VR technology, his computer programming skills were rudimentary and he relied on ZeniMax's computer program code and games to demonstrate the prototype Rift.""";Amazon Pulled Up in India;": India's foreign minister censured Amazon for selling doormats featuring India's flag after a Twitter user tagged her with a picture of the said mats that Amazon Canada was selling. ""Amazon must tender unconditional apology. They must withdraw all products insulting our national flag immediately,"" she tweeted. ""If this is not done forthwith, we will not grant Indian Visa to any Amazon official,"" she followed up in another Tweet. ""We will also rescind the Visas issued earlier."" While some attempted to trivialize the matter, others lauded her. Her tweet was retweeted several thousand times.";Technology/Products;Apple Original Content;: People familiar with the matter are saying that Apple is hunting for rights to original TV shows and has been in talks with veteran producers. The programming will reportedly be made available to 20 million plus people that have already signed up for its $10-a-month music streaming service by the end of the year. Original movies are also in the works although that will likely take more time.;Apple iPad Problems Could Be Gone Soon;:  Apple analyst Ming Chi Quo says that the company is getting ready to launch three new iPads next quarter in 12.9-inch (with A10 processor), 10-10.5-inch (A10 processor), and 9.7-inch (A9 processor) sizes. Kuo has a great track record in breaking Apple news before the company itself does, so this may be more than a rumor.;At any rate, the analyst is more optimistic about iPad shipments this year (despite an expected decline of 10%) because last year was worse, because iPad Pro is growing stronger versus the cheaper Mini, and because chances of lower costs due to increased competition amongst display providers.;Separately, Apple has now given us a reason for the inconsistent battery life of its iPad, which is the particular testing style that turns off the Safari cache. Apple said this is not a real-world situation and Consumer Reports apparently confirmed that normal consumer testing resulted in consistent results. A second review/report from the firm is now awaited.;Intel 5G;: At CES, Intel launched its first 5G modem saying that companies could now start developing 5G solutions. 5G is expected to increase network speeds, as more IoT and home network devices connect with the cloud and autonomous driving becomes a reality. Verizon is the first carrier to adopt: the company plans to start 5G deployment this year. Intel's early start may help it gain share versus Qualcomm, which pretty much owns the 4G market.;Video Ads on Facebook;: Facebook will soon be serving ads in the middle of video clips from established news houses and sharing 55% of the proceeds with content creators just the way YouTube does. But unlike Facebook, YouTube shares revenue with all content creators and not just professionals. Facebook is probably just testing the product with plans of a broader rollout later on.;Facebook also requires videos to be at least 90 seconds long with the ad not kicking in until at least 20 seconds of the video is played, thus encouraging longer and more engaging video on the platform. So it looks like an important step towards growing the time spent on the platform and ultimately pulling in more TV ad dollars.;Nintendo Launches New Switch Console;: Nintendo has finally launched its first game console (Switch) in four years and the company initially expected to sell 2 million of the devices by the end of March. But pricing for the more elaborate Switch, which doubles as a smart home hub, is a disappointment, because it's 20% more expensive than the earlier unsuccessful WiiU in Japan and comes for the same price in the U.S.;The earlier device had limited choice in terms of games and was also hit by the shift to mobile gaming. This device holds more promise and Nintendo has said that more than 50 game software makers are developing 80 titles for the Switch. Of these eight will be available at launch in Japan.;M&A and Collaborations;Microsoft Buys Maluuba;: Microsoft has bought a Samsung-backed artificial intelligence startup called Maluuba for an undisclosed sum. Maluuba's specialty is in what it calls general artificial intelligence, i.e. the ability for bots to think, reason and communicate like humans. Microsoft is focused on making Cortana more appropriate for enterprise use, something that other smart assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant haven't prioritized. The ability of a smart assistant to carry out an entire operation requires greater cognitive capabilities that can set Cortana apart and help Microsoft advance in the cloud computing race.;Google Shutters Titan;: Google had a number of plans to take Internet to more people. It was also considering use cases for drones. The company's Titan project brought these two ambitions together, i.e. it was a plan to beam Internet to remote areas using drones. But soon after Facebook's similar idea crashed unceremoniously, Google also shelved its plans because of technical difficulties. Its Project Loon appears to be on track to deliver however.;Google Buys Swedish Software Company;: Google has bought Sweden's Limes Audio, primarily for its patented TrueVoice noise reduction software. Google offers a number of communication services including Chromebox, Hangouts, Allo and Duo. It's expected that the acquisition will help Google improve the audio quality of its services, even in low-bandwidth conditions and help it compete more effectively with rival services like Skype.;Alibaba Buys China Retailer;: Alibaba is buying traditional Chinese retailer Intime, which operates 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls across urban China for $2.6 billion. Alibaba is the leading Chinese online retailer by far. Its current growth strategy is focused on bringing international brands to urban Chinese consumers while also increasing penetration in rural areas. This acquisition gives it offline presence that can be used to showcase products when necessary that customers can buy on site or on its website (the raging omnichannel trend).;Some Numbers;Apple Leads Wireless Headphones Sales;: A new report from Slice Intelligence says that 75% of all headphones sold in December were wireless and that 26% of total wireless headphone spending was on Apple Airpods. And if that isn't enough, its Beats headphones are also doing extremely well, accounting for 32% of wireless headphone sales over Cyber Weekend.;PC Market;: PC shipment reports from IDC and Gartner are out and as usual the difference in measuring criteria means that their estimates differ slightly. So while IDC says that PC shipments declined 1.5% in the Dec 2016 quarter, Gartner says the decline was as much as 3.7%.;Also, while both agree that the top three vendors were Lenovo, HP and Dell in that order, IDC sees Apple as number four followed by ASUS, while Gartner says it's the other way around. IDC also says that the market continues to stabilize with most geographies coming in stronger than expected.;The U.S. declined slightly as high channel inventory going into the seasonally stronger quarter was depleted. In EMEA, desktops came in about as IDC expected while notebooks outperformed. Many factors affected APAC: India's demonetization was negative, China's continued demand for thin and light consumer PCs was positive, commercial was weak in both India and China and impacted by macro concerns in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines with Korea growth being an exception. Overall, competition from tablets and phones has eased up.;Zacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term   Profit;Today you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Here’s What To Expect In 2017 From the Laptop Market (MSFT, AAPL, INTC);January 18, 2017, 02:00:08 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;2016 was quite the year for the laptop market. The competition   was favorably stiff, as each brand tried to do their absolute   best to come up with the technology that would crush its   rivals.;Despite the success of the tablet, laptop sales didn't suffer   much last year. Ultrabooks and 2-in-1s flourished in a market   where trying to find a decent laptop-replacement tablet proved   fruitless.;"makeArticleAd();";Last year also opened the eyes of many traditional gamers, who   thought laptops would never be as powerful as desktop   computers.;The reasons ranged from power efficiency limitations to   overheating, but all these were dismissed by products like the   remarkable Schenker XMG U727 and the even more decorated;ASUS ROG GX700;: the world's first liquid-cooled laptop.;"Evidently, therefore, notebook manufacturers went in hard last   year. However, going by 2017's ""laptops coming soon"" list, as   well as the already announced hardware from industry players like   Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA, things are bound to heat up pretty   severely this year.";Below is a look at our expectations for the laptop in 2017,   and why you should be excited if you aren't already.;Hardware Makers Won't Slow Down Innovations;Gone are the days where power meant having a car-sized desktop   PC with all sorts of performance modifications. Nowadays, you can   walk into a retail shop and pick out a laptop that will   comfortably labor through your demanding apps and games;That said, hardware manufacturers aren't slowing down this   year. For starters,;Intel Corporation;(;INTC;) has already made its new 7th generation Core i-series   processors - codenamed Kaby Lake - available for desktop PCs. The   chips range from an entry-level Core i3, all the way up to a   10-core Extreme Edition Core i7 (soon to be launched). It is now   only a matter of time before new laptop releases feature the new   tech.;So, what can we expect from the new generation CPUs? In   addition to the obvious improvements such as better overclocking,   power efficiency and graphics upgrades, laptops with 7th   generation processors will support Intel's new Optane memory: a   memory module that is designed to virtually improve the read and   write speeds of hard drives.;The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' Picks;Intel is also planning to follow up Kaby Lake with Cannon   Lake, which will be based on its first-generation 10-nanometer   production technology. We are expecting Cannon Lake U-series   processors to appear in ultrabooks and 2-in-1 laptop/tablet   devices later this year.;Moving on from Intel,;Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.;(;AMD;) also has a few tricks up its sleeve. Its;7th-gen (Bristol Ridge and Stoney Ridge);processors - which the company announced last year - are expected   to be significantly faster than their predecessors, while   simultaneously giving Intel chips a run for their money.;These chips should already be making their way into some new   Asus,;Dell Inc.;,;HP Inc;(;HPQ;) and;Lenovo Group Limited (ADR);(;LNVGY;);laptops;.;AMD might not be doing enough to ward off the fierce Intel   competition, but it's certainly got its claws out for;NVIDIA Corporation;(;NVDA;). Through their Alienware line, Dell amazingly made the   previously desktop-exclusive AMD RX 470 Polaris available for   laptops late last year.;More manufacturers will undoubtedly follow suit. It will also   be exciting to see how these new AMD cards will fair in   comparison to NVIDIA's upcoming GeForce 20-series. What is   apparent, however, is that 2017 will see gaming laptops reach   heights never reached before.;Design's Dramatic Moves;The laptop's internal hardware has come quite a long way in   the last few years, but the design has evolved just as   drastically.;"Not that long ago, laptops were clunky, bulky and mostly   devoid of any attention to detail. But in the quest to be crowned   ""the fairest of them all"" manufacturers have recently gone to   great lengths to come up with some really stylish products.";Now, you will find a laptop that is almost as thin as your   smartphone, with a beautiful exterior, feathery weight and a   premium finish that will make heads turn when anyone sees it.;But what can we expect in 2017? Well, for starters, there will   be an even bigger emphasis on portability. 2016 saw the   overwhelming success of the 2-in-1, thanks in great part to the;Microsoft Corporation;(;MSFT;) Surface Pro 4. Hybrids are now worthy replacements to   traditional PCs, and the world knows it.;It is, therefore, no surprise that manufacturers have more   than a few brilliant 2-in-1 and ultraportable releases lined up   for this year. Asus, for instance, is ready to take the market by   storm when it makes the successor to its bestselling;Chromebook Flip;available for retail.;Dell also has a;convertible version of its XPS 13;laptop in the pipeline, which with a nearly bezel-free screen is   expected to be the smallest 13-inch laptop yet. The company is   also planning a convertible version of the Latitude 13 business   laptop to be unveiled soon after the XPS 13.;"HP's EliteBook X360; advertised as ""the thinnest   business-centric 2-in-1,"" and Lenovo's Miix 720 are also   exemplary-designed products to watch out for.";But perhaps what we all can't wait to see is Razer's   awe-inspiring;Project Valerie;. The futuristic and somewhat impressively ludicrous piece of   technology aspires to bring portability to immersive gaming with   three automated, foldable 17.3-inch 4K screens for the most   expansive viewing experience we have ever seen in a notebook.;Software;Microsoft hasn't said anything about a new OS version, but   expect more features and an overall improved design language with   Windows 10 Creators Update version 1704, which as the version   number indicates is set for release in April, this year.;Laptop;Although test builds never show the full picture, the latest   Insider Version of the upcoming update features some new settings   to help users dictate how updates will be installed. You can   pause Windows updates for up to 35 days, and also choose whether   or not to include driver updates when updating.;Also included are tweaks inside Settings to help users get to   the right options faster, a Microsoft Edge browser improvements,   more Windows Defender functions, smoother animations, among other   generous features.;The Best Investments for 2017;While the update will be available for manual download, we can   safely expect it to come preinstalled in some of the laptops   planned for release after April.;The next biggest notebook OS is;Apple Inc.'s;(;AAPL;) OS X, and rumor has it that plans for the next OS X 10 update   are underway. MacOS 10.13, the follow-up to Sierra is presumed to   be unveiled around mid-2017, and so far, nothing other than UI   tweaks and app redesigns can be predicted for sure. Apple   probably hasn't even settled for a codename yet. For now, all we   can do is sit and wait.;Although we have our expectations, no one can know for sure   how the laptop scene will be when the year ends. From the look of   things, however, there's a high chance that things will be   great.;About the Author;Vigilance Chari is a freelance writer currently covering     tech news and gadgets at;LapopNinja;.

Is International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock in Danger?;January 18, 2017, 10:48:10 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;International Business Machines Corp.;(NYSE:;IBM;) pulled off a solid 2016, with IBM stock up about 16% to beat the broader market.;Source: Shutterstock;However, the stalwart IT company faces an early test in 2016 - its fourth-quarter earnings report, which is slated for Thursday after the market closes.;"makeArticleAd();";The biggest question many analysts and investors have heading into Thursday: Can the company's restructuring get the fundamentals back into gear?;What to Expect From IBM Earnings;Well, Wall Street hasn't set the bar too high.;IBM earnings are expected to reach $4.88 per share - up just 4 cents on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are forecast to hit $21.6 billion, a 2.3% dip that would extend IBM's streak of sales declines to 19 consecutive quarters.;The 7 Best REITs to Buy for High Yield AND     Growth;That said, a decline in revenues shouldn't be alarming. IBM is moving toward cloud computing, which means moving from charging customers on a one-time basis to a subscription structure. The plus side? Predictable revenues. The downside? IBM is restricted in how much it can report.;If this sounds familiar, it's the predicament;Adobe Systems Incorporated;(NASDAQ:;ADBE;) found itself in a couple years ago. However, their switch to more of a subscription model has gotten the company back on a growth path. The transition merely needed to take its course.;So IBM stock holders will be awfully interested in seeing how the cloud business is performing. Here, there's reason to be upbeat. In Q3, revenues in this segment jumped an impressive 42% to $3.4 billion. You can thank numerous advantages to being an established tech giant like IBM, such as a trusted brand, a wide assortment of mission-critical software systems and a large high-end consulting business, which has helped with deployments for companies like;Salesforce.com, Inc.;(NYSE:;CRM;) and;Workday Inc;(NYSE:;WDAY;).;Another core driver is Watson, which continues to make strides in the megatrend of artificial intelligence. Already, IBM has leveraged this technology into growth areas including customer service, the internet of things, financial services, weather forecasting, regulatory compliance and even cybersecurity.;IBM Stock: The Risk Factors;On the flip side, IBM still has much to do before the turnaround can be considered complete, and a number of headwinds could hinder the momentum.;The market for cloud computing is getting crowded and more intense. Just a short list of major competitors includes;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;),;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) and;SAP SE (ADR);(NYSE:;SAP;).;But investors shouldn't count out other worries.;For instance, there's uncertainty regarding Donald Trump's policies regarding trade, as well as concerns about the soaring dollar (which Trump recently nodded to). Both of these are issues that will cause problems for many U.S. multinationals, including IBM.;Something else: IBM is beset with legacy businesses, such as hardware systems and on-premise software, that are expected to deteriorate even further.;To put it kindly, IBM is a juggling act.;Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Hike App Store Prices     ... Because Brexit?;Some Wall Street analysts aren't convinced that IBM is getting up to speed. Credit Suisse' Kulbinder Garcha, for instance, believes earnings will take a hit this year. That's why he slapped a dismal;$110 price target;on IBM stock, implying a 34% decline from current levels.;Bottom Line on IBM;I think any extreme bearishness on IBM stock is overblown. Wall Street has been rightly factoring in sluggish growth, and it seems all too aware that a turnaround will take time. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on IBM is just 12, compared to 19 for Microsoft and 20 for SAP.;Turnarounds can be choppy. But when results begin to materialize, the stock can get legs in a hurry, as;Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co;(NYSE:;HPE;) shareholders would attest. HPE stock is up about 80% over the past year.;Patience can pay off, and I believe this will be the case for IBM stock.;Just ride out the earnings volatility for now, and IBM's traction in the cloud and AI will eventually make things right.;Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog;IPO Playbook;and is a registered investment adviser representative (you   can;visit his site;to learn more about his financial planning services).;He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.;Follow him on Twitter at;@ttaulli;.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Hike App Store Prices … Because Brexit?;January 18, 2017, 10:14:53 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;According to an email to developers,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is making plans to raise prices in its U.K. App Store by   approximately 25%. The price hike is, apparently, in;response to the weakening pound sterling exchange   rate;, which has been steadily dropping since June's Brexit vote.;Source: Apple;"makeArticleAd();";The price changes are expected to roll out to the App Store   over the next week.  Per;The Guardian;:;"""Similar price increases are expected to hit other Apple   Stores, including the iTunes Store for music and video and the   iBooks Store.""";This announcement comes on the heels of;October's unilateral 20% price jump;for AAPL hardware, including the company's newest MacBooks, Mac   Pro, and the iMac.;Brexit Vote Pulled Down the British Pound;After the Brexit vote, which occurred last June, the value of   the British pound has depreciated approximately 18.5% against the   U.S. dollar and is currently on its way to a;31-year low;. This devaluation of the pound, together with the U.K.'s 20% VAT   rate, has led to price parity between the United States and   Britain. In short, that means an app that once cost 99 cents in   the U.S. and £0.79 in the U.K. will now cost £0.99.;Interestingly, Apple's price increase is actually;higher;than the loss of value to the British pound. The question on the   minds of many investors' and analysts' is: Are the price   increases in the Mac and iOS app stores an indication that AAPL   management believes the pound may fall further? Or is the   Cupertino tech titan taking advantage of the volatile financial   situation?;7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in       2017;According to;Forbes;, Apple reported that total spending in its App Store was almost   $30 billion, which generated;more than $20 billion in revenue;for developers last year, up more than 49% year over year. This   means the App Store created more than $8.8 billion in revenue for   the company.;It's also worth noting that approximately 10% of the $28   billion or so in App Store sales resulted from subscriptions. The   assumption among many is that Apple's modified revenue-sharing   agreement with developers, which reduced the revenue share split   from 30/70 to 15/85 after one year, was largely responsible for   the subscription revenue growth.;Additionally, the Apple TV App Store is assumed to have been a   contributing factor as well, given that 2016 was the first full   year that the platform was open to developers.;The Apple Store and AAPL Stock;The bulk of revenue for AAPL's App Store comes from the U.S.   and Japan. However, last year,;China surpassed the U.S.;as the largest download market for iOS apps in the first quarter,   according to App Annie.;The meteoric rise of the iPhone in 2015 was followed by;sharp declines in iPhone sales in China in   2016;. Yet, revenue from the App Store in the China grew faster than   in other regions, which is understandable considering the newness   of iOS to Chinese consumers. The depreciation of the pound in the   U.K., however, took away from otherwise impressive overall   revenue figures for the App Store.;It shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that AAPL management   has chosen to institute a broad price increase in the U.K. But   overall, the Apple Store price hikes won't likely amount to much   more revenue. Instead, they'll prevent declines.;How U.K. iOS users will respond to these price hikes is yet to   be seen. More than likely, there will be the expected mumbling   and grumbling, but in the end consumers will have no choice but   to pay the increased prices for apps. Developers will enjoy   additional revenue for the same work.;AAPL stock investors, on the other hand, should be   rejoicing.;Apple Inc. Faces a New Threat to the iPhone 8       (AAPL);Apple's App Store already was expected to do extremely well   this year, given the overwhelmingly positive response on New   Year's Day. So, the results of the Brexit vote on App Store   prices, while irritating for iPhone owners, actually is a   positive thing for Apple stock holders.;In the long run, however, the price hike is minor. Even though   25% is statistically significant, in the real world of apps that   cost an average of 99 cents to a few dollars, 25% price increases   aren't really that dramatic.;Bottom line: Don't expect any major negative fallout from this   … but maybe a slight bump.;As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in     any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Could Top $30 After       Earnings;The 7 Best REITs to Buy for High Yield AND       Growth;The Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Safety in       2017;The post;Apple Inc.

With the Surface Book and Surface Studio, it stole some of;Apple Inc.'s;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) design thunder. Now reports have MSFT preparing to launch its own eBook store, competing with;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;). And it's also attacking;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) on its home turf, bringing Cortana to the Android lock screen.;Source: Google Play;It's no secret that Google chose to make its Android operating system free, because doing so would guarantee more smartphones and tablets using Google Search. Since advertising is where Google makes its money, having the increasing number of mobile users remain on its search engine was critical to keeping that ad revenue flowing.;"makeArticleAd();";Cortana on Android;Microsoft took a shot at Google when it released;Cortana for Android and iOS;at the end of 2015. Microsoft's personal digital assistant uses Bing - MSFT's search engine - when users ask it to check on something. That bypasses Google Search. And using Cortana bypasses Google Now, Android's built-in personal assistant.;Now Microsoft is taking Cortana on Android a step further. According to;The Verge;, the company is preparing a new version of the app for Android that makes;Cortana accessible from the lock screen;. One swipe and Cortana is ready and listening. That would let Cortana completely replace Google Now by also offering quick access instead of having to fire up the phone and launch an app.;The timing is perfect, because the latest AI-powered Google Assistant is exclusive to the Pixel Phone. That's leaving some Android users feeling left out. Owners of a smartphone from;Samsung Electronics Co Ltd;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) or any other third-party Android manufacturer, can make a statement by skipping Google Now and switching to Cortana instead.;Windows eBook Store;When you think of eBooks, you think of Amazon. There are other options like Google Play and Apple's iBooks, but Amazon and its Kindle devices dominate the eBook world. Even if Windows 10 users don't own a Kindle, they can buy and read Amazon eBooks on their Windows 10 device using the Kindle app.;Apple Inc. Faces a New Threat to the iPhone 8     (AAPL);According to;PCWorld;, a leaked version of Windows 10 shows MSFT is preparing to take on Amazon by;launching a Windows eBook store;. The company added EPUB file support to its Edge browser last year - that's the eBook format used by everyone;except;Amazon. With that file support in place, buyers could read titles purchased from the Windows eBook store on any device with the Edge browser installed.;This encroachment into Amazon territory comes just weeks after MSFT announced it would;take on the popular Amazon Echo;with Cortana-powered smart speakers.;MSFT Gets Aggressive;All of these developments show a Microsoft that's shifting from a defensive strategy to a more aggressive one. It has completed Windows 10 and its efforts to retain PC customers. Now it's transitioning to a strategy of releasing products designed to win new customers away from competitors.;3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) MUST Do to Soar in     2017;They don't have to go all-in on Windows - although switching from an Apple MacBook Pro to a Surface Book would require making the leap. Buying eBooks from a Windows eBook store isn't going to kill Amazon, but another viable alternative chips away at its dominance. Getting an Android user to dump Google Now for Cortana on Android gets that person on Bing instead of Google Search, which is a win for MSFT and hurts Google. The experience may even be enough to get them to dump Android altogether and switch to a Surface phone, should MSFT ever decide to release one.;"And with AI and machine learning looking to be a big part of the consumer technology future, the more people actively using Cortana - including on Android smartphones and Echo-like speakers - the ""smarter"" Cortana gets.

Silicon Valley Should Drop Its Obsession With Apple-esque Secrecy;January 18, 2017, 09:41:00 AM EDT;CEO Tim Cook is willing to sacrifice a little bit of secrecy   for the sake of collaboration. Image source: Apple.;Without a doubt, an obsession with secrecy has worked;very;well for;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) . So much so that all those stories you hear about   the seemingly insane security protocols that it subjects even its   internal employees to have become part of Silicon Valley lore. In   a way, Apple's success has created a mentality that excessive   secrecy is a useful marketing tool, one that can be harnessed in   powerful ways.;"makeArticleAd();";But this ignores the inherent downsides of secrecy, downsides   that CEO Tim Cook has recognized. That's why Cook broke down   Apple's internal silos with an;executive restructuring;in the name of collaboration nearly half a decade ago. It's   awfully hard to collaborate with co-workers when you have   absolutely no idea what they're working on due to systemic   isolation.;For every Apple, there are a dozen (or more) not-Apples. In   fact, I can't think of a single other tech company that has   harnessed secrecy with such extraordinary results. But that   hasn't stopped Silicon Valley from trying.;Dressing like Steve Jobs;Consider Theranos, the biotech start-up that has experienced a   painful fall from grace that started in October 2015 following a   series of investigative reports by;The;Wall Street Journal;. Founder Elizabeth Holmes idolized Steve Jobs, including Jobs'   fixation with secrecy and how well that worked for Apple. That   contributed to the culture of secrecy that she created at   Theranos, as well as her penchant for black turtlenecks. For a   while there, Theranos was able to use secrecy as a way to build   hype for what it was working on, claiming it could perform a   plethora of blood tests using tiny samples of blood, while   traditional methods required vials.;Has Holmes been raiding Jobs' closet? Image source:     Theranos.;"But the rules in biotech are far different than those in   consumer electronics. This wasn't just some hardware or software   product that you don't want copied by competitors; it's quite   literally a matter of life and death. That's why the medical   community is an open scientific community, where peer review is   par for the course. For years, Theranos famously refused to   release its internal data to the community, citing ""trade   secrets."" During its decline, Theranos said it would start   sharing data in August 2016. Too bad Holmes instead chose to use   her presentation at that month's American Association for   Clinical Chemistry's annual meeting in Philadelphia primarily to   pitch a new product. She shared a little bit of data that day,   but it was largely considered insufficient for scientific   purposes.";Amid the controversy, Theranos also used its culture of   secrecy as a way to internally downplay public concerns, which   didn't help boost employee morale. It's safe to say that secrecy   did not work out well for Theranos.;Imagine your work emails disappearing;More recently, Snap is preparing to go public within a matter   of months. Snapchat has become an incredibly popular social media   platform, particularly among teens. Founder Evan Spiegel is also   obsessed with secrecy. Just yesterday,;Bloomberg;reported on the start-up's culture of secrecy. It's absolutely   mandatory reading for any public investor that is considering   buying in once shares are publicly available.;Many employees first learned of Snap's Spectacles through   media reports and rumors. When asked, the company wouldn't even   confirm to its own employees that such a product was in the   pipeline. Following leaks regarding its upcoming IPO, Snap   assumed that its investment bankers were leaking information and   threatened to pay them less unless they agreed to even stricter   confidentiality agreements (as if the standard IPO process wasn't   secretive enough).;Video source: Snap.;Easily the most confounding part of the report is that   Spiegel's preferred form of internal communication with other   executives and employees is through Snap messages, which   disappear after being read. That just sounds ridiculous. Imagine   your boss or manager sending you an important work email, which   disappears and self-destructs shortly thereafter. Forgot a   pertinent detail in the email? Tough. Need to forward it to   another co-worker for a work-related reason? Too bad.;Frankly, I'm not even sure how that's legal. Companies are   subject to a wide range of state and federal document retention   laws. According to Snap's own;privacy policy;", Snap doesn't just hide Snap content from public view once it   expires or is seen by intended recipients; it actually deletes   the content from its servers. Other types of content like Stories   have ""different deletion protocols."" Presumably, Snap has   different standards for internal Snap messages, noting that it   may ""retain certain information in backup for a limited period of   time or as required by law.""";Whether or not Snap can maintain its obsession with secrecy,   which seems to be greater than Theranos', remains to be seen.   Apple has been able to balance product secrecy with the public   disclosures associated with being a public company (Apple went   public nearly five decades ago). The irony for Apple is that   attention is in part a function of size, so as Apple grew to   become the world's most valuable company with an increasingly   globalized supply chain, secrecy simply couldn't prevail. (When   was the last time an Apple announcement wasn't leaked in detail   ahead of time?);Can Snap pull off such an Apple-esque balance? I doubt it.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Forbes analyst has cited few beta users who are still suffering from sudden shutdowns when the battery reaches near the 30% mark. The bug surfaced after the iOS 10.1 update and the problems compounded with the 10.1.1 update. Reportedly, several users complained that their iPhone batteries would suddenly drop to 30% and even result in sudden shutdown of the phones.;Per media reports, earlier Apple faced safety issues in China as eight iPhone 6 handsets reportedly exploded. As per a report released by the Shanghai Consumer Council last month, iPhone 6 batteries powered down emitting smoke and eventually exploded. Apple failed to provide adequate explanations and take up any recall measures.;"Moreover, the battery draining problem has been critiqued by China Consumers Association as the company failed ""to meet basic consumer needs for normal wireless communication"". With Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco and iPhone explosion and battery problems, analysts observe that all these have caused a sense of ""distrust"" among Chinese consumers towards international (as well as expensive) smartphone brands.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Faces Anti-trust Charges From the FTC;January 18, 2017, 08:44:00 AM EDT;Qualcomm Inc.;QCOM;, globally the largest mobile chipset manufacturer using baseband technology, has recently faced an anti-trust lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulator filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that the company has used anticompetitive measures to maintain a monopoly in baseband chipset market.;The FTC said Qualcomm had established an exclusivity agreement with iPhone and iPAD maker Apple Inc.;AAPL;from 2011 to 2016. Through this deal the San Diego-based chipmaker provided billions of dollars in license rebates to Apple subject to the condition that Apple would not use chipset of Qualcomm's rival companies. The company recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity of the deal to prevent the latter from working with and improving the effectiveness of its competitors.;"However, Qualcomm argued that the FTC's complaint is based on ""flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry"". While the chipset maker observes major flaws in the accusations, it is likely get a full hearing. Following the news, the stock price of Qualcomm declined $2.69 (4.02%) on Nasdaq, yesterday.";The FTC alleged that Qualcomm has excluded competitors from getting a foothold in the baseband chipset market by using unfair means to secure business, thereby harming consumer choice. Notably, Intel Corp.;INTC;and Media Tek are closest competitors of Qualcomm in this filed. In addition to iOS, Qualcomm chipsets are vastly used for Alphabet Inc.'s;GOOGL;Google developed Android software and Microsoft Corp.;MSFT;developed Windows operating system.;Qualcomm generates approximately 29% of its total revenue from the licensing business however, this business accounts for almost 77% of the company's net profit. Moreover, the company has a history of facing allegations related to licensing disputes. The US regulator is latest in the line of accusers alleging Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position and imposing unfair licensing terms.;In 2015, the Chinese regulatory authority, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) fined Qualcomm for nearly $975 million as a charge of abusing China's anti-competitive terms. In Dec 2016, the company was fined nearly $886 million in South Korea for restrictive licensing practices. Moreover, since 2011, Qualcomm has been under investigation for competition violations in the European Union region.;Price Performance of Qualcomm;In the last one year, the stock price of Qualcomm has gained a substantial 40.09% compared with a meagre 0.9% gain of the Zacks categorized;Wireless Equipment;industry. Qualcomm, the undisputed leader in the global wireless baseband chipset market is widening its presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, and mobile computing strategies, which bode well for long-term growth. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is best known for its versatility in IoT applications.;However, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms and anti-competitive charges are some of the major headwinds faced by the company.

Baidu (BIDU) to Boost Profits with New Augmented Reality Lab;January 18, 2017, 08:20:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();";Augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality is the next big technological innovation along with artificial intelligence (AI) technology.;In a bid to further increase its share in the augmented reality (AR) market and thereby give a boost to its declining profits,;Baidu, Inc.;BIDU;recently launched an AR lab in Beijing.;Currently, the lab employs 55 people and will help the company to drive revenues through AR marketing. Going forward, the company will also focus on developing healthcare and education related technologies, thus expanding its revenue base.;Coming to the price performance, over the last one year, shares of Baidu underperformed the Zacks characterized;Internet Services;industry. The stock returned only 7.66% while the industry gained 16.36%.;Rationale Behind the New AR Lab;Baidu is under great pressure to expand its earnings as it is troubled by new government curbs on medical advertising. These curbs have reduced its core search business, resulting in a drop of ad customers by 16% in the last reported September quarter. Also, revenues of RMB18.253 billion ($2.737 billion) decreased 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.;The launch of the new lab is part of the $200 million investment announced by Baidu in September. The company aims to expand its revenue base and gear up its earnings with new investments related to developing AR technologies.;Also, the company is working with AR in China with various brands namely, Yum! Brands Inc's KFC, BMW and L'Oreal SA's Lancome among others.;"Andrew Ng, the chief scientist overseeing Baidu's AI, AR and deep learning projects, believes that AR marketing is taking off. He added, ""I feel like the abilities for AR have risen up in China faster than the Western world may be aware"".";The company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 23. Baidu projects revenues to drop around 4.6% in the fourth quarter.;Bottom Line;Baidu provides Internet search services in China. It also offers a Chinese language search platform for businesses to reach their customers.;With so much buzz created by AR/VR and AI technologies, all tech giants, right from Alphabet;GOOGL;, Facebook;FB;and Apple;AAPL;to Microsoft are scrambling to grab a share of this lucrative market. Just last week, Apple announced that it is working on AR/mixed reality headsets and has partnered with a renowned lens maker. Facebook acquired Oculus in 2012 to fuel the company's ambitious VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held last month, Facebook announced another $250 million investment to develop a VR content ecosystem.;The Chinese search engine has also started to focus on the development of these technologies. These are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.;We believe that these efforts will help Baidu to grab a decent share in the fast growing AR market.;Baidu, Inc.

Why You Don’t Need to Fear The ‘Overpriced’ Market;January 18, 2017, 06:46:07 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;"If you Google the phrase, ""is the stock market overpriced,""   you'll get more than 600,000 hits on how the market is ready to   fall off a cliff. That search will find you article after article   comparing today's market to 1999 and even 1929.";Several articles try convincing their readers that the market   is as much as 80% overvalued - as if that statement has any real   meaning.;"makeArticleAd();";Others say prudent investors should stay away from the stock   market after it hits a new high. They reason that the market must   revert to some mean level before it can sustain a move   higher.;On that, I call BS.;Here's why…;It turns out that, historically, the best time to buy stocks   is after a new 12-month high as opposed to a new 12-month low.   Now this may seem illogical or counterintuitive. After all, you'd   think the market would have more upside potential after hitting a   new low than a new high. But I have 90-years of data to prove   that hypothesis incorrect.;You see, the historical record going back to 1928 shows that   stocks perform 160% better after hitting an all-time new high.   Take a look at the chart below. The data shows that the 12-month   return after hitting a new high is 7.3% versus the 12-month   return of just 2.8% after a new low.;And the data wasn't cherry-picked to make the point. I looked   at all 12-month periods after a new high or new low since   1928.;Better yet, the numbers above represent actual returns in the   market. They aren't influenced by dividends, but if they did the   total return would be even higher.;What this means is that investors shouldn't be afraid of   buying stocks after the market hits a new all-time high. On the   other hand, investors should be afraid to buy stocks after a new   12-month low.;The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' Picks;So this begs the question…;Can Stocks Go Higher In 2017?;The answer is yes. Let me explain…;Most times, the main driver of stock prices is earnings. In   fact, there's an old saying that as earnings go, so go stock   prices. It's a truth burned into most investors' minds.;But it isn't always true.;Now don't get me wrong, earnings are the most important driver   of stock prices… most of the time. The problem here is that   earnings over the past several years haven't grown in real terms.   Rather, they've been manipulated to a large extent by stock   buybacks.;By buying back its stock, a company reports its earnings per   share over a reduced share count. By doing that, they make it   appear their earnings are rising - when in fact they're level, or   quite possibly in decline.;It's a neat trick if your shareholders aren't paying   attention. But it hides the fact that a company isn't growing its   earnings. And in a normal market, that should cause stock prices   to fall.;But if earnings haven't been the main driver of stock prices   in recent years, what has driven the market to the highs we see   today?;It's simple. The main driver has been ultra-low interest   rates.;What Does This Mean?;To understand if stocks can go higher from current levels,   investors must consider whether stocks are a good deal relative   to interest rates. In other words, investors must consider both   stock valuations AND interest rates when making investment   decisions.;Now, short term interest rates have risen since late last   year. Some of that is from the Fed's actions. But the Trump rally   has done a fair share of pushing rates higher based on the   expectation of future higher inflation.;But despite the recent rise, interest rates remain incredibly   low by any historical measure. And with the prospect of higher   inflation, investors aren't likely to be lured to the higher   coupons of bonds. The yields just don't justify the inflation   risk.;That means stocks will continue to be favored over   income-producing assets through 2017.;But There's Another Reason…;Investors make a mistake when they focus on the overall   market.;The idea of an overvalued market is meaningless. You see,   unless you own stock indices, such as the;SPDR S&P 500 ETF;(;SPY;), you don't own the market.;You own stocks, like;General Motors Company;(;GM;) or;Apple Inc.;(;AAPL;).;Of course, every company is different. Their earnings are   growing or declining. They're in cyclical businesses that are   expanding or contracting. They have wide moats and narrow moats,   mega trends or no trends.;In other words, each stock is its own entity. You can believe   that the market is overvalued, but that doesn't tell you anything   about the current valuation of;The Coca-Cola Co;(;KO;) or any other stock.;"So, it's an abstraction to say the market is overvalued. The   ""market"" as an entity that can be valued only exists in some   ethereal sense.

Currency Woes Force Apple, Inc. to Increase U.K. App Store Prices;January 17, 2017, 07:25:00 PM EDT;^DXY;data by;YCharts;.;This isn't the first time that;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) has had to increase international prices in   response to currency fluctuations. Generally speaking, the U.S.   dollar has been on a multiyear run, strengthening against most of   the world's currencies since 2014. In recent memory, we've seen   the company;adjust prices in Russia;following incredible volatility of the ruble in 2014, followed by;Canada, Australia, and the European Union;in 2015. Importantly, currency risks;aren't going away anytime soon;, considering the fact that roughly two-thirds of Apple's   business comes from abroad.;"makeArticleAd();";Following the U.K.'s historic decision last summer to exit the   European Union, the pound has taken an utter beating relative to   the dollar. The pound's weakening is largely in response to   concerns around the economic impacts of Brexit combined with   capital outflows coming out of U.K.;USD/GBP exchange rate. Image source:;XE.com;. Annotation by author.;"In response to the pound's continued weakness, Apple has been   forced to increase prices in its U.K. App Store by approximately   25%. This isn't a decision that Apple takes lightly; it knows   that pricing volatility is bad for consumers, and price increases   naturally hurt local demand. ""We price our products in a way that   is in general reflective of pricing here in the United States and   it's a pricing that we want to keep in place for reasonable   periods of time,"" CFO Luca Maestri noted on a 2014 earnings call.   ""We do not like to make sudden changes to our pricing.""";But Apple has to balance its own financial needs with those of   consumers, and if the fluctuations are beyond the scope of its   currency hedging program, it has little choice but to adjust   prices in order to preserve its financials.;The more important price hike is already in the rearview   mirror;The silver lining for investors is that adjusting App Store   prices will likely have a pretty small impact on the business.   Remember, this is for digital content that the U.K. installed   base purchases over time, which subsequently gets accounted for   in Apple's services segment. We don't know the size of Apple's   installed base in the U.K., but it's not really a large country   overall relative to other markets, with a current population of   approximately 65 million.;Image source: Apple.;"More importantly, Apple already increased the prices for its   actual products last year, a couple months after the Brexit vote.   In September, Apple increased iPhone and iPad prices, including   for the new iPhone 7; the hikes ranged from 30 pounds to 60   pounds. Macs saw more meaningful increases in October, given the   higher prices for computers. The Mac Pro saw a price increase of   a gut-wrenching 500 pounds. Those price hikes were far more   painful for U.K. customers.";Europe isn't a growth market for Apple (sales up just 3% in   the third quarter), but hopefully those price increases didn't   hurt Apple's sales during the holiday shopping season too badly.   Apple reports fourth-quarter results at the end of the month.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Top Home Automation Investments;January 17, 2017, 07:12:00 PM EDT;If you're considering an investment in the home automation   segment, there are a mind-boggling number of choices. You can   invest in individual component manufacturers, professional   systems installation companies, or managed services. We will look   at some of the best in each category.;Home automation falls into three very broad categories. Let's   look at a few potential investments in each:;Professionally installed systems.;Managed service systems.;Do-it-yourself (DIY).;"makeArticleAd();";Home automation is reaching into every aspect of our lives.   Image source:;Pixabay;.;The whole shebang;Professionally installed systems are integrated when the home   is built or a retrofit is done. There are several such companies,   but most are privately held. One exception, that's also a leader   in the field -- is;Control4 Corporation;(NASDAQ: CTRL) . This is the only pure play on the list. This   company is extremely small, with a market cap of about $265   million, at the time of writing. It provides a wide variety of   systems and options and serves both the home and business   markets. It provides choices in all the major component   categories including lighting and environment controls,   entertainment, security, and networks to control them all. It   also integrates with over 10,000 existing third-party   products.;On the operational side, the company has been growing revenue   and earnings, up 27% and 49%, respectively, year over year in the   most recent quarter. It has been expanding gross margin and   investing in sales and marketing efforts, which Control4 believes   will result in additional revenue growth. It has been developing   internationally and acquired Pakedge Networking last year.   Control4 believes that having its own networking solution will   not only drive revenues but also help dealers identify issues in   customer networks, leading to greater levels of customer   satisfaction. The company is growing its network of dealers that   install its products and increasing its addressable market by   providing solutions for middle-income homeowners while still   serving the luxury market. This company seems to be pursuing   growth in a smart and measured way, and the stock will probably   move higher.;The future of awesome;Image source: Comcast.;Managed service systems offer a more limited range of   offerings, centered mostly on security, while charging a monthly   monitoring fee. The best way to play this segment may be an   investment in;Comcast Corporation;"(NASDAQ: CMCSA) . Its service is security based but also provides   lighting and environment controls, while already having an ""in""   with networks and entertainment from its cable and broadband   offerings. It sees this market as a natural extension of its   existing business. Having its own broadband provides distinct   advantages, allowing it to control that portion of the   equation. The company has consistently grown both revenue   and earnings over the past five years, and the stock has   increased 174% to the S&P's 73% over the same time   period.";Alexa, can you find my... ?;The do-it-yourself market is much more cluttered and provides   a variety of options to the discerning investor.;Amazon.com;'s(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa,;Alphabet;'s(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Assistant, and;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) Siri all represent entries into the nascent   virtual-assistant category, and all offer a multitude of products   that integrate with their devices. Each of these virtual   assistants responds to voice commands.;Amazon Echo and Echo Dot. Image source: Amazon.com.;Amazon currently has the advantage of a yearlong head start   with its Amazon Echo speaker system, powered by Alexa. It has   meanwhile been integrating Alexa into its other products,   including its Echo range, Tap, and Fire TV. This advantage should   not be underestimated. Amazon released Alexa to third-party   hardware providers that have been integrating Alexa into their   products.  The list of products Amazon's assistant can   partner with is quite extensive, including such diverse   offerings as hubs -- which control and network the system --   lighting, and environmental, as well as a laundry list of   big-name service partners.;Not to be outdone, Apple recently released its HomeKit, which   comes with its Siri pedigree and its own list of iCompatible   device categories that include alarms and sensors, heating and   cooling, and lights and switches. These are compatible across a   wide swath of iPod, iPads, and, of course, iPhones.;iPhone 7 powered by Siri. Image source: Apple, Inc.;Google, though late to the party, wants to steal the show. The   Google Assistant is the brains behind the Google Home smart   speaker and is integrated into the majority of Google-branded   hardware products, including Android phones, Chromecast, and   Android TV. It will also network with Google's software programs,   including Google Calendar and Maps. In a recent research report,   analytics firm IHS Markit reported that it believes that Google   Smart Speakers will overtake Echo's lead by 2020.;Did I mention that these three companies also have other   businesses?;Image source: Google.;No company is perfect, and each of these suggestions comes   with its own potential downside. Amazon's dominance as an   e-retailer is well known, and home automation is one of many   additional revenue streams it's pursuing. Since it has a P/E of   187, investors need to understand that if home automation is what   they're interested in, they're paying a premium for Amazon's   projected growth in online retail and the plethora of ventures   it's pursuing. Google's premium is much more reasonable, with a   P/E of 30, but similar to Amazon, home automation represents only   a small fraction of its business. Apple is the most reasonably   priced of the three, with a P/E of 14, but be aware that its   share price, along with the majority of its revenue and income,   depends directly on the success or failure of its ubiquitous   iPhone and its release cycles.;The Foolish final word;"While not inclusive, this list provides investors with a   starting point to invest in the home-automation segment. There   are many ways to play this burgeoning market, so maybe one should   ask ""Alexa, what's the best home automation investment?"" On   second thought, better not: Her answer might be biased.";Find out why Amazon.com;is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now;Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

"Apple Inc.'s ""Super Cycle"" Problem";January 17, 2017, 05:27:00 PM EDT;Later this year,;Apple;"(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to launch new smartphones that will,   per some analysts, catalyze a ""super cycle"" -- essentially a   significant acceleration in iPhone shipment growth because of a   major fundamental change to the phones.";Image source: Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";The last such super cycle was the iPhone 6 cycle. Apple was   late to bringing large-screen smartphones to market, which led to   significant pent-up demand for large-screen iPhones. Once Apple   finally delivered them -- and in late 2014, Apple released two   large-screen phones (iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus) -- the company   enjoyed substantial iPhone unit and average selling price   growth.;After this super cycle, sales of Apple's iPhone 6s series of   smartphones were poor, driving the company's first-ever   year-over-year iPhone unit decline. The iPhone 7 series appeared   to be getting off to a good start, but now we are seeing several   analysts trimming their estimates as negative supply chain data   comes in.;Apple bull Katy Huberty with;Morgan Stanley;, for example,;just reduced;"iPhone revenue estimates for the current fiscal year (units down   7%, partially offset by 4% increase in estimated average selling   prices) due to ""weaker iPhone 7 demand"" (though she notes that   iPhone 7 Plus is stronger).";However, Huberty, like many Street analysts, is expecting that   the iPhones released later this year will catalyze an iPhone   6-like super cycle. Huberty, for example, expects Apple to ship   253 million iPhones in fiscal year 2018 (up 20% year over year)   with average selling price growth of 6%.;All this talk about super cycles, however, leads me to wonder   the following: Can Apple find a way to grow iPhone unit shipments   and revenue between these so-called super cycles?;Killing the super cycle;The harsh reality is that the main reason that these super   cycles ever happen is that Apple's product development   methodology leads to the company delivering products that are, on   the surface, very similar for at least two generations (three, in   the case of the iPhone 6, 6s, and 7).;"That's not to insult the hard work that Apple's engineers put   into each new generation of devices; under the hood, Apple's   iPhone 6s was a solid jump from the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 7   was a nice improvement from the iPhone 6s.";The engineering of Apple's latest phones is superb -- the   displays are excellent, the applications processor generations   ahead of the competition in some ways, and much more -- but the   phones have the same general look and feel as iPhones from 2014   and 2015.;New guts, old body -- Apple's entry level iPhone offering.   Image source: Apple.;Here's the problem, though -- does the average smartphone   buyer care about all of the fine work that went into engineering   the latest iPhones?;Do average consumers really care beforehand (and this part of   it is key) that the chip inside of the iPhone 7 runs circles   around the one in the aging iPhone 6 that they're using? Probably   not. But it is the sort of thing that a consumer can come to   appreciate once she or he has purchased the new phone for;other;"reasons (such as, ""I like how it looks"").";Consumers seem to be attracted to devices with thinner bezels   than the ones found on the current iPhone models, and curved   displays also seem to be in vogue. OLED displays, too, are   becoming more popular, even in non-curved smartphones.;With the next-generation iPhones, Apple is rumored to deliver   these aesthetic and technical changes/improvements, which is why   so many are counting on a super cycle.;"By introducing these features, Apple not only serves to stop   current iPhone users from defecting to competing devices, but it   can also bring people back who had switched precisely because   Apple wasn't delivering the ""whiz-bang"" features and aesthetics   that they were looking for.";In other words, pretty much exactly what happened when Apple;finally;introduced larger iPhones.;By now, it should be very clear how Apple can kill the super   cycle -- it needs to make aesthetic/design changes at a faster   pace. A new aesthetic every two years was already pushing it, but   forcing customers to wait three years simply seems to be too   much.;These changes don't even need to be sweeping   generation-over-generation, but they need to be noticeable to the   average smartphone buyer.;If Apple can do that, then the super cycle concept will die,   and along with it, the uncomfortable boom/bust cycles that   Apple's iPhone business suffers over multiyear periods.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How This Apple Inc. Supplier Created Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs in the United States;January 17, 2017, 02:00:00 PM EDT;One of;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) most important component suppliers is;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company;(NYSE: TSM) , or TSMC for short. TSMC is believed to be the sole   manufacturer of the Apple-designed A10 applications processor   that powers the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and it also builds   chips for many chips that Apple procured from third-party   suppliers, to boot.;Image source: Intel.;"makeArticleAd();";On TSMC's most recent earnings call, analyst Charlie Chan   asked TSMC Chairman Morris Chang the following question:;My first question is regarding the advisory reports to the     U.S. President this Friday, because in a report, the U.S. seems     want to ensure their semiconductor leadership, especially in     the leading-edge, so what will be TSMC's strategy to beating     this policy direction and ensure your own leadership?     Thanks.;"Chang had a very extensive answer in which the key message is   this: TSMC has created ""hundreds of thousands of jobs in the   United States in the last 20-30 years of [its] existence.""";How could a chip manufacturer that owns and operates no   manufacturing plants in the United States create so many jobs in   this country? Let's take a closer look.;Building an industry;"Chang began by explaining that TSMC ""for all practical   purposes"" created the fabless semiconductor industry model. Early   in the life of the semiconductor industry, a company that wanted   to design and sell chips also had to build those chips. As   the complexity and costs associated with chip manufacturing grew,   it became increasingly impractical for chip designers --   especially smaller ones -- to afford to own and operate their own   chip manufacturing plants.";What TSMC did is recognize that, while many chipmakers   individually didn't have the scale to develop new chip   manufacturing techniques and spend all the money to build out   manufacturing capacity, many small chipmakers, in aggregate,   could provide the necessary revenue and unit scale to make chip   manufacturing feasible.;By enabling virtually any chipmaker, large or small, access to   robust chip manufacturing technologies and sufficient capacity,   TSMC created a ton of value for its shareholders, and made it   possible for more chip companies to emerge and even prosper.;With that background in mind, we can now understand Chang's   job-creation argument.;Fabless semiconductor industry employs many;"""The fabless industry, I believe, employs hundreds of   thousands of people in the United States,"" Chang explained on the   call. A fabless semiconductor company, as is implied by the   name, is a chipmaker that relies on third parties to manufacture   its chips, since chip-manufacturing plants are often called   ""fabs"" -- short for ""fabrication plants.""";"""So, I think we'll continue to create more jobs in the United   States by helping the fabless industry in the United States,""   Chang added.";The executive also made another good point: It isn't just;fabless;semiconductor companies that rely on TSMC for chip-manufacturing   services -- there are chipmakers that run their own manufacturing   plants based in the United States that rely on TSMC for   manufacturing services.;Intel;(NASDAQ: INTC) , which brings in about twice the annual revenue   that TSMC does, is a prime example of a chipmaker that owns its   own manufacturing plants -- many of which are based in the United   State -- but still relies on TSMC to manufacture some of its   products, such as wireless chips.;These aren't;manufacturing;jobs in the United States that TSMC has created, but because TSMC   allows many chipmakers to operate and thrive without needing to   own and operate their own chip plants, the semiconductor industry   can support a broader, more diverse range of companies.;Those companies often employ many individuals in the United   States, including chip-design engineers, engineers who work   closely with TSMC to build their products, product marketing, and   much more.;Some examples of large United States-based employers that rely   on TSMC for the manufacture of some, if not all, of its chips   include;Qualcomm;, the leading merchant mobile chipmaker, and smartphone giant;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which has large chip-development operations in   California and Texas.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Maybe Apple, Inc.'s AirPods Aren't Doing As Well As You Think;January 17, 2017, 01:01:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;Last week, e-commerce analytics tracker Slice Intelligence   estimated that;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) was already;dominating the market for wireless headphones;, thanks to the launch of AirPods in December and supplemented by   Beats' existing strong position in the market. Specifically,   Slice was estimating that Apple was grabbing an impressive 40% of   the wireless headphone market between AirPods and Beats combined.   If that sounded too good to be true considering the severe supply   constraints that AirPods are currently suffering from -- well,   maybe it really was.;"makeArticleAd();";Survey says;Market researcher NPD has now released some data that   questions Slice's estimates (via;CNET;). According to NPD's data for December 2016, Apple currently   only has 2% unit share of the wireless headphone market, while   Beats has 25% unit share. Given Apple's premium pricing for both   products and brands, that translates into 3% revenue share for   AirPods and 46% revenue share for Beats. Here's how some of the   other top players fared for the month, ranked by revenue   share.;Company/Brand;Unit Share;Revenue Share;Beats;25%;46%;Bose;8%;19%;LG;10%;7%;Sony;7%;6%;Apple;2%;3%;Data source: CNET.;"For reference, NPD estimates that a year ago in December 2015,   Beats was able to grab 24% unit share and 49% revenue share,   comparable performance to this time around; Beats' strong   position in the premium headphone space was one key reason why   Apple acquired the company. More importantly, Beats was able to   maintain its position even as the market has been evolving and   shifting toward wireless Bluetooth headphones, so Beats is   keeping up with the times.";Why the difference?;That's a pretty drastic discrepancy between Slice's numbers   and NPD's numbers for AirPods -- 26% compared to 3% in revenue   share, respectively. There are a few possible explanations.;For starters, Slice only looks at online sales and its   methodology revolves around analyzing e-receipts that are   aggregated from a panel of over 4.4 million online shoppers (the   sample sizes for Slice's estimates ranged from about 2,900   shoppers to over 350,000 shoppers). NPD, in contrast, also   includes brick-and-mortar sales along with online sales, which   should provide a more comprehensive view of the market. While   e-commerce has been growing for years, brick-and-mortar retail   still comprises a meaningful chunk of the market, so ignoring   that part of the market can lead to some faulty conclusions.;Additionally, given Slice's methodology of tracking   e-receipts, it's not clear how unfulfilled orders are treated.   It's possible that Slice picked up on a surge of online orders   following the launch, but AirPods are still suffering from severe   supply constraints and new orders don't ship for six weeks. It   seems conceivable that a lot of the sales that Slice is tracking   may not be filled yet, and only tracking e-receipts could   artificially inflate the figures even if many of those customers   haven't actually received their products.;Still impressive;Here's the thing: Even if investors go with NPD's far more   conservative figures, it's still an impressive debut for AirPods.   Keep in mind that AirPods launched in mid-December, and yet   despite constraints and only being available for half of the   month, they were able to grab 2% unit share and 3% revenue share   in a fairly large market. And those numbers only go up from   here.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here Are The Latest iPhone 8 and MacBook Rumors;January 17, 2017, 12:56:00 PM EDT;For years, Apple;AAPL;was heralded as the tech world's top innovator, and its product launches were always highly anticipated. However, with iPhone sales slumping and critics chiming in about the company's design choices, Apple's product debuts are not what they once were. Nevertheless, some users are already looking forward to what Apple will do with the iPhone 8 and the next line of MacBooks.;iPhone 8 Buzz;"Apple is expected to release three new iPhones in 2017, including two for an alleged ""iPhone 7s"" lineup. However, rumors are already swirling about the iPhone 8, which is expected to debut much later in the year.";Right now, many within the industry expect the iPhone 8 to include a curved Samsung OLED panel, measuring a little over 5 inches. This would be the first OLED display on Apple's flagship mobile phone line and would represent a move towards a bigger screen.;We expect Apple to be going with an OLED display because of a growing level of concern from its competitors over the availability of OLED screens. With Apple finally utilizing the OLED technology, many of the company's China-based rivals are worried about a worldwide supply shortage.;The other persisting iPhone 8 rumor surrounds wireless charging. Many people expect the iPhone 8 to be rolled out with some level of wireless charging capabilities due to other rumors that Apple is reverting back to glass backs, as its metal cases could interfere with wireless signals.;Cue Energous Corporation;WATT;, a developer of a wire-free charging technology that promises to offer long-distance wireless charging abilities. While Energous is a long way from successfully delivering on its early ideas, many are linking Apple and Energous, and we could see some Energous tech in the iPhone 8.;There have also been some whispers that Apple is looking to gain an IP68 water and dust resistance certification for the iPhone 8. This is a tougher level of certification than is seen on the iPhone 7, and it would mean that the phone could be submerged at 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes.;MacBook Murmurs;Apple just debuted its latest version of the MacBook Pro after a long wait. While it appears that the new MacBooks are selling well, many users and critics were upset with its price point and several of Apple's design choices, including capping its RAM capabilities at 16 GB and using older interior mechanisms.;Despite these new laptops just being released, rumors are already swirling that Apple is looking to address some of these criticisms. In fact, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently published a research note that suggested Apple was looking to update the MacBook again before the end of the year.;According to Kuo, Apple is set to offer price discounts throughout the year, update to Intel's;INTC;latest line of chips, fix battery life complaints, and debut a 32 GB 15-inch option. Kuo said he anticipates a new 12-inch model to come out in Q2, with the updated Pros coming in Q3.;Bottom Line;It seems like users are critiquing Apple's newest products more so than ever, and that may be reflected in the company's sales difficulties. Nevertheless, if the rumors surrounding the iPhone 8 and MacBook Pro eventually pan out, Apple could be right back in a leadership position.;Also Read:;This Old Apple Slogan Perfectly Explains What's   Wrong With The Company Today;Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017;In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?;Who wouldn't?

Why I'd Be Terrified of Apple, Inc. Acquiring Netflix;January 17, 2017, 12:30:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;People have been speculating about;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) acquiring;Netflix;(NASDAQ: NFLX) since the dawn of time. While there are some valid   strategic rationales for doing so, the financial justification   for such a deal would be untenable largely due to Netflix's lofty   valuation.;"makeArticleAd();";Consider the fact that Netflix's current enterprise value is   around $60 billion, before even factoring in some sort of   acquisition premium. That's already about 20 times as large as   Apple's biggest acquisition to date, the $3 billion purchase of   Beats in 2014. The size of the Beats deal was itself   unprecedented, about six times as large as any Apple acquisition   before it. A Netflix acquisition also would be extremely dilutive   to margins (Netflix's net margin is about one-tenth of   Apple's).;Beyond all that, there are signs that Apple is looking to   dabble in original video content. While the company has;explicitly stated;that it has no intention of competing directly with video   streaming services, instead clarifying that any original video   content would serve as a differentiator for Apple Music, Apple's   growing interest in video will only spark even more speculation   about a possible Netflix acquisition going forward. Meanwhile,   CEO Tim Cook has said that price will no longer be a limiting   factor for potential acquisitions. Here's Cook just a few months   ago on the November earnings call:;We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of     strategic value where we can deliver better products to our     customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety     of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move     forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely     look.;So yeah, I'd expect the speculation over a Netflix acquisition   to only intensify from here. Here's why that terrifies me.;An unflattering comparison;To be clear, I'm a shareholder of both companies, and as such   my Netflix position would benefit quite nicely if Apple were to   scoop up the dominant video streamer at a hefty premium. Yet if   that ever came to fruition, I'd be scared of what that says about   Apple.;If Apple were to acquire Netflix, it would be an   incontrovertible admission on Apple's part that it's running out   of ideas for its core business, and the expansion via acquisition   into online video streaming services would not only be   ridiculously expensive but also desperate. We've seen this play   out before. When growth companies start to mature, organic growth   becomes more elusive and management teams sometimes turn to   blockbuster acquisitions as a way to get investors excited again,   buying growth in new markets instead of creating it   organically.;In general, the risk that an acquiring company takes is   commensurate with the price tag, since the magnitude of the   premium directly affects how much goodwill is subsequently   recorded on the balance sheet -- goodwill that may be written   down and impaired if the deal fails to create value. Even now,   the book value of Netflix's shareholder equity is just $2.5   billion.;Furthermore, it's not as if Apple investors are pricing in   considerable growth expectations right now. Shares are currently   trading at just 14.4 times earnings and 2.9 times sales, far   cheaper than peers. You might argue that Apple could spur   multiple expansion if it increased investor growth expectations   (such as with an acquisition), but the flip side could be that   investors hate the deal because of the financial implications and   what it says about Apple's ability to innovate on its own, which   may send shares lower and contract its valuation multiples. It's   rather common for shares of acquiring companies to fall when they   announce deals due to investor skepticism, particularly large   ones. They bigger they are, the harder they fall.;If Apple were to ever announce this mythical Netflix   acquisition, I would consider it the first sign that Apple may   indeed entering a;lost decade;similar to what its software rival from Redmond experienced in   the early 2000s. It wouldn't be a coincidence that;that;company's lost decade included numerous blockbuster acquisitions,   many of which failed and collectively resulted in;tens of billions of dollars in shareholder value   destruction;. Note that the initial rationales for many of those deals   wouldn't be dissimilar to why many believe that Apple should   acquire Netflix.;Please don't do it, Tim.;Find out why Netflix;is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now;Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market. (In fact, the newsletter they     run,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor,;has tripled the market!*);Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for     investors to buy right now.

Square Inc (SQ) Stock Is Red-Hot for All the Right Reasons;January 17, 2017, 12:05:40 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;The bullish case for payment-processor;Square Inc;(NYSE:;SQ;) is becoming increasingly difficult to digest. Revenue continues to rise, but the loss continues to widen. It's not the forward progress one would hope to see by this point.;"makeArticleAd();";Yet, there it is. Square stock is up 75% since its June low, decisively shrugging off a couple post-IPO selloffs from the first half of 2016.;What gives? The obvious answer is the correct one. That is, investors decided the conceivable future for SQ stock looks considerably more compelling than it did just a few months ago. And, this time around, it was analysts leading the opinion rather than being led by it.;Those professionals may well be right about Square stock too.;SQ Stock Analysts Say …;It's true that a picture is worth a thousand words, so in the interest of time and efficiency, take a look at how analyst opinions on - and price targets for - SQ stock have morphed over the course of the past year.;10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print Money;The pros are clearly changing their tune on Square, for the better.;Equally interesting is the commentary that accompanied those upgrades. Take, for example, what Pacific Crest analyst;Josh Beck wrote;"when he upgraded Square stock to ""Overweight"" back in November:";"""Square is set up for a consistent series of positive fundamental surprises over the next year. Payments and (operating expense) upside may shift focus to incremental profitability and cash flow, leading to a positive re-rating of the stock.""";One of those positive fundamental surprises Beck was referencing was the company's then-recent foray into lending.;Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank echoed the idea a few days later,;commenting;"on his firm's upgrade of Square stock to a ""Buy"":";"""Square is currently at an important inflection point as it turns towards profitability while maintaining industry leading growth rates. We believe Square's current Q4, 2016 guidance and street fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 estimates could prove conservative.""";Needham opened up its coverage of SQ in mid-December,;"also calling it a ""Buy""";largely because it provided a soup-to-nuts solution for small businesses. Pacific Crest said something along those same lines earlier this month when it;raised its price target on Square stock from $15 to $17;, as Barclays did around the same time. When one person or organization says it, it's dismissible. When two say it, it's curious. When three say it, there's something to it. But when four say it, it's difficult to disagree with the budding consensus.;What Changed?;So how does a stock the market is barely lukewarm on - a stock of a company that has been reliably unprofitable despite revenue growth - suddenly find that much favor among the analyst community? The aforementioned entry into small-business lending is one of the big reasons.;It's a business the company actually got into a long while ago. It wasn't a division Square investors could get excited about, however, until the second quarter of 2016 when Square Capital's;loan originations grew 123% on a year-over-year basis;. That big growth convincingly sent a message that lending could indeed become a key profit center.;It's not just making loans in a period of rising interest rates that bodes well for Square stock for the foreseeable future, however. CEO Jack Dorsey, who splits time with his role as chief of;Twitter Inc;(NYSE:;TWTR;), has been putting a handful of new initiatives in place.;One of those initiatives is an effort to start winning more large clients, rather than limit its focus to small and mid-sized merchants. It's working too. In the third quarter of last year, gross payment volume for its larger customers;grew 55% year-over-year;, versus only 39% growth for its overall payment volume handled.;3 Reasons Square Inc (SQ) Stock Is Prime Buyout Bait;Peer-to-peer payments have also become a reality for SQ. And, after launching its virtual payment card in September,;Square announced in December that card would work with Apple Pay;, exposing the payment middleman to the;10 million people;that use the service from;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) every week.;These are all big steps forward, even if they've gone largely unnoticed by most investors. That said, the stock's 30% advance since the middle of last year clearly indicates at least a few people are noticing.;Bottom Line for Square Stock;As difficult as it may be to step into a company that's still posting losses and is expected to do so again in this year, analysts aren't likely to be wrong in being increasingly bullish on Square stock. The company has been doing a lot, and getting good traction with most of it, since its late-2015 IPO. With a price-to-sales ratio of a modest 3.19, the eventual swing to profitability could be quite catalytic for SQ shares. Indeed, the mere ongoing advance to that end zone has already proven catalytic for Square stock.;As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second Wind;7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in 2017;The post;Square Inc (SQ) Stock Is Red-Hot for All the Right Reasons;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.

Take Advantage of a Misunderstood Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock;January 17, 2017, 10:47:52 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Fitbit Inc;(NYSE:;FIT;) investors;declared in a unified voice;back in early November: Enough is enough. FIT stock collapsed 30% after the company's fourth-quarter and full fiscal year guidance fell well below analyst expectations.  Game over, Fitbit is done.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Via Fitbit;Based on the reaction of FIT stock, the wearable fad is all but dead … or;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is eating Fitbit's lunch with its newly improved Apple Watch.  This, however, couldn't be further from the truth as Fitbit likely proved naysayers wrong during the holiday shopping season.;Yet FIT stock is currently trading within striking distance of its all-time lows of $7.20, so investors should take advantage of the stock's weakness.;The Wearables Market Is Still Growing;There is no doubt that the wearable market isn't as hot as it was just a few years ago, but that doesn't mean the market isn't growing.;According to;IDC's data;, which was released on Dec. 5, the wearables segment grew 3.1% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2016. By comparison,;the global smartphone market;grew 1.1% year-over-year over the same time period.;IDC added that Fitbit is the clear winner, as it shipped 5.3 million units in Q3, up from 4.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The company also boosted its market share to 23% from 21.4% a year ago.;By comparison, Apple was ranked fourth, having shipped 1.1 million Apple Watch units in the third quarter, down from 3.9 million a year ago. This contributed to Apple's share in the wearable market plunging from 17.5% a year ago to 4.9%.;7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in 2017;"IDC also suggested that Fitbit will ""continue leading the pack in the near term"" and the industry as a whole has been ""down in recent quarters, but clearly not out.""  Does this sound reflective of a stock that is down 60% over the past year?";FIT Stock: The Holiday 2016 Winner;The ultra-important 2016 holiday shopping season has come and gone. Investors are forgiven to be working under the assumption that overall sales were a complete disaster, at least based on;Kohl's Corporation;(NYSE:;KSS;) and;Macy's Inc;(NYSE:;M;) dismal holiday sales figures.;However, First Data reported on Jan. 9 an industry-wide breakdown of what consumers were buying, and it bodes very well for Fitbit stock. Sales of health and personal devices;rose 5.6%;during the holiday season, marking an acceleration from last year's 2.4% growth.;For those who want to nitpick and argue that Fitbit is more of an electronics company then the sales data is even more encouraging. Sales of electronics rose 8.5% during the holiday season, marking a complete reversal from last year's 2.2% decline.;Need some more encouraging signs that the holiday season was likely very successful?;"How about this - aside from ""Super Mario Run,""";no other app was more downloaded;on Apple's iPhone app store. Yes, this means that iPhone users are shunning the Apple Watch in favor of a Fitbit device - for the second straight year.;Overbeat;And Underappreciated?;No one is saying FIT stock will recover all of 2016's losses but the argument can be made that FIT stock has been beaten up so much that investor expectations are so poor.;Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Ugly as Sin, But Has a Chance for Redemption;It is however likely that Fitbit's growth story is underappreciated and even the slightest beat would rejuvenate the stock.

Fitbit Inc. Is Running Out of Room to Grow...What's Next?;January 17, 2017, 10:16:00 AM EDT;Fitbit;(NYSE: FIT)  crashed 75% last year on concerns about its   slowing sales growth, narrowing margins, and rising competition   in the wearables market. Yet IDC claims that Fitbit remains the   largest wearables maker in the world, and its market share   rose 160 basis points annually to 23% last quarter,   fueled by the launches of the Charge HR and Charge 2.;Image source: Fitbit.;"makeArticleAd();";But as Fitbit matures, it's running out of room to grow. Its   scattergun strategy of releasing more devices across different   price points hasn't reversed its sales declines, cheaper players   like;Xiaomi;are reducing price expectations, and higher spending on R&D   and marketing has hurt its bottom line growth.;Analysts expect Fitbit's revenue to rise just 26% this year   and 3% next year, compared to 149% growth   in fiscal 2015. But Fitbit isn't oblivious to that slowdown   -- it plans to diversify its top line away from fitness trackers   with three new strategies.;Corporate and academic wellness programs;To widen its moat against its rivals, Fitbit developed   corporate wellness programs for companies and organizations.   These programs track employees' personal activity with Fitbit   devices, and reward active participants with lower health   insurance premiums.;In late 2015,;Target;(NYSE: TGT)  signed on to offer Fitbit devices to   335,000 employees in a bid to lower its healthcare costs. Through   the program, Target employees could either receive the basic Zip   for free, or buy a pricier device with Target partially   subsidizing the cost. Teams of employees competed against each   other in month-long competitions, with Target donating $1 million   to a charity on behalf of the winning teams.;Fitbit has also been expanding this program to   schools. Last year, the Oral Roberts University became;the first school;to require all incoming freshmen to wear Fitbit trackers.   The students are required to walk 10,000 steps daily, and are   graded based on their weekly exercise routines instead of an   end-of-semester field test.;Fitbit doesn't disclose exactly how much revenue it generates   from these programs, but CEO James Park previously stated that it   was less than 10%. But if Fitbit can sign on more corporate or   academic partners, it may offset its slowdown in mainstream   consumer sales.;Expanding into smartwatches;Fitbit took its first steps into the smartwatch market with   the Blaze last year. But Fitbit is also expanding inorganically   into that market. Last December, it agreed to acquire   smartwatch maker Pebble's IP portfolio and some of its employees   for about $40 million. Fitbit claims that the purchase will help   it launch new smartwatch-like devices faster and improve its   existing devices.;Earlier this month, Fitbit agreed to buy high-end smartwatch   start-up Vector for an undisclosed amount. Unlike the;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL)  Watch, which only lasts about a day on a   single charge, Vector's Lunar and Meridian smartwatches   last a full month without recharging.;Vector's Luna smartwatch. Image source: Vector.;The smartwatch market has been a disappointing one thus far,   since many consumers either stuck with smartphone apps or   bought cheaper basic fitness trackers. Apple only sold about 12   million watches in 2015 -- which completely missed   prior estimates as high as 60 million. But looking   ahead, Fitbit could leverage its position as the top wearables   maker in the world to bolster the appeal of smartwatches among   mainstream consumers.;Building an app ecosystem;Another soft spot for Fitbit is its lack of an app store   ecosystem.;Apple,;Garmin;(NASDAQ: GRMN) , and many other smartwatch makers already let   developers populate their app stores. Apple offers clear   instructions for watchOS developers, and Garmin;does the same;with its Connect IQ platform. Yet Fitbit creates its own   apps, which prevents its platforms from evolving as quickly.;"At CES, Park told reporters that Fitbit planned to launch its   own app store ""as soon as possible."" Many industry watchers   believe that by buying Pebble's IP, Fitbit can quickly launch an   app store for its devices -- which could attract new apps or   ported apps from watchOS, Android Wear, or Connect IQ. Taking a   cut of paid app sales could also generate a fresh stream of   revenue for Fitbit.";But can Fitbit keep growing?;"Signing new corporate wellness deals, launching new   smartwatches, and building an app ecosystem might diversify   Fitbit's top line away from its core devices, but it's a tough   uphill battle. To survive, Fitbit must defend a ""sports   performance"" niche between high-end smartwatches and low-end   fitness trackers -- but that could be tough, since Garmin and   other rivals are already targeting the same market.";10 stocks we like better than Fitbit;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Fitbit wasn't one of     them!

Apple Inc. Faces a New Threat to the iPhone 8 (AAPL);January 17, 2017, 10:06:14 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Apple inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is all too familiar with Andy Rubin. The creator of Android led the effort to knock iOS off its perch and take a commanding lead in the smartphone platform wars. With a critical iPhone 8 release scheduled for 2017, Rubin is once again poised to be a thorn in AAPL's side with news he is preparing to launch his own Essential smartphone.;Source: Global Playground;If the new AI-powered, flagship smartphone from Rubin's company lives up to the hype, the;Samsung;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) Galaxy S8 and the next;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) Pixel Phone may be the least of Apple's worries this year.;"makeArticleAd();";Re-Introducing Andy Rubin;A one-time Apple engineer, Andy Rubin quickly became a serious threat to the company's mobile ambitions. In 2003, he co-founded Android. When Alphabet's Google bought the mobile operating system in 2005, he became the Google senior vice president responsible for Android.;Rubin continued in the position until 2013, when he took over Google's robotics division before leaving the company altogether in 2014.;Now, Rubin is back in the spotlight with his own company -;Essential;- which is focused on artificial intelligence. And it features a flagship smartphone as its product centerpiece.;The Essential Smartphone;Bloomberg was the first to report on Andy Rubin's new company after CES 2017.;According to Bloomberg;, Rubin is in discussion with mobile carriers, including;Sprint Corp;(NYSE:;S;), about the Essential smartphone.;7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in     2017;The device is still in the prototype stage, but sources say Rubin is planning to launch it by the middle of the year, at a $649 price point. That would mean a new flagship smartphone hitting shelves just months before the;iPhone 8;. It would add to the tough competition of the Galaxy S8, which will be heavily promoted by Samsung, as well as the follow-up version of Google's Pixel Phone.;The Essential smartphone may pose an even bigger threat to the iPhone 8 than these two Android front-runners.;Bloomberg's sources describe a smartphone with a larger display than the iPhone 7 Plus, but a smaller form factor because the Essential smartphone has an edge-to-edge display that lacks bezels. A magnetic connector does double-duty for charging and as a port for hardware accessories, including a spherical 360-degree camera. The screen could be pressure-sensitive, like the iPhone's. And Essential is reportedly working on a ceramic back, which would utilize the same premium material used in AAPL's latest flagship;Apple Watch Edition Series 2;.;Behind it all, the Essential smartphone would feature advanced AI technology, which would take on Siri.;Is This a Real Threat to the iPhone 8?;On one hand, it's easy to dismiss the Essential smartphone. It's still in the prototype phase, and if its design is finalized, it may ultimately lack some of the features like the ceramic back. There are big unanswered questions, too, including what operating system it will run.;And then there's the dubious success rate of companies trying to muscle their way into a mature smartphone market.;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) found this out the hard way when its;Fire Phone flopped;several years ago.;On the other hand, Andy Rubin has a proven track record. He's very well-connected in the industry and has been successful in raising capital. His Playground Global hardware incubator;raised $300 million in 2015;. According the;Bloomberg;report, Rubin is actively in talks with not just Sprint over distribution, but also;Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.;(OTCMKTS:;HNHPF;) - better known as Foxconn - as a manufacturing partner for the Essential smartphone.;Rubin also has a team of engineers recruited from Google and Apple working on the phone, with a former Samsung executive heading up marketing.;Why Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Could Pop After     Q4 Earnings;The Essential smartphone could be a credible threat. Its mid-2017 target release date gives it a shot: Samsung is still recovering from the Galaxy Note 7 PR nightmare, Google's Pixel Phone has yet to capture significant market share and the iPhone 8 will be months away.;If the Essential smartphone lives up to its billing, with a powerful AI and premium design, and gets a push from carriers like Sprint, it could be a big deal.;That would be a serious problem for AAPL, which is counting on the iPhone 8 launch to re-ignite its stalled iPhone sales.;As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace:;Is Apple Inc.

Are Pandora's (P) Strategic Efforts Headed the Right Way?;January 17, 2017, 09:33:00 AM EDT;Pandora Media Inc.;P;has been in trouble for quite some time now. Despite the fact that Pandora holds a prime position in the online radio market, the company has been struggling with profitability. Further, rising costs related to licensing, footprint expansion and higher operating expenses will add to its woes.;As the company provides music streaming services on the Internet, it has to pay hefty music royalties and licensing fees, which makes its operations much more expensive. Additionally, the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) raised the;royalty rates;by 15% last December. This added to the already high content costs.;Things went further downhill last year as there were questions about the standalone status of the company. There were numerous speculations, the most notable among them being that of satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) making a fresh offer to acquire music streaming services provider.;Pandora Media, Inc. Price;Pandora Media, Inc. Price;|;Pandora Media, Inc. Quote;"However, Pandora has taken strategic measures to post a turnaround. Last year, the company announced Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium services. While Plus is a ""one-of-a-kind, ad-free radio experience"" available for $4.99 per month, Premium will create a playlist for users based on their playlist history, which CEO Tim Westengren was quoted saying as the ""standout"" factor. It will be ad free and will enable users to save songs for offline listening. Premium carries a price tag of $10. However, analysts observe that Pandora's new service doesn't offer something radically different from what is already available in the market.";Also, as part of its strategy, Pandora acquired companies like Next Big Sound, Rdio and Ticketfly. In addition, it is cutting label deals to reduce dependence on CRB rates and better manage its content costs. It has struck licensing deals with Sony Music, Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner;TWX;and Universal Music Group.;Recently, to lower costs, Pandora announced a 7% cut in its workforce. Ticketfly will reportedly not be affected by the workforce trimming. It also added that it is on track to better its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, revenues are expected in a range of $362 million to $374 million.;Shares are up almost 6.33% since the announcements. In the past one year, Pandora's shares have grown 35.03% compared with the Zacks categorized;Internet Services;industry's gain of 16.36%.;Though these initiatives appear to be headed in the right direction, analysts observe stiffening competition as a very powerful threat. Pandora's entry has been pretty late in the on-demand music services arena, which boasts big names like Spotify and Apple Inc.;AAPL;.;Plus, the digital music streaming industry is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years and all the players including Apple, Spotify, Tidal, Pandora and Amazon;AMZN;are striving to strengthen their presence. As per a Statistica report, revenues from digital music streaming are projected to grow approximately 9.47% between the period 2016 and 2020, leading to market volume of $2,773.2 million by 2020.;In fact, Apple Music has seen phenomenal growth. Within a year and half of its existence, reportedly, Apple Music now has over 20 million paid subscribers, inching closer to Spotify's 40 million paid subscribers. Apple Music's tie up with popular music artists like Taylor Swift and many more has been widely considered by analysts as the key to its success.;Will the cost cutting initiatives and new streaming services help Pandora post a turnaround?

Netflix Streaming Joins the iPhone in Turning 10;January 17, 2017, 09:17:00 AM EDT;Image source: Netflix.;January turned out to be a pretty big month for consumer tech   in 2007. The media was buzzing about;last week's 10th anniversary;of;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) Steve Jobs taking the stage to peel back the   curtain on the iPhone. Yesterday was the seemingly less   buzzworthy 10th anniversary of;Netflix;(NASDAQ: NFLX) announcing that its DVD-by-mail renters would;soon be able to stream video content;.;"makeArticleAd();";The announcements were just eight days apart, but they would   go on to change the world. The smartphone has arguably become the   most important consumer tech innovation ever. Apple may not have   been the creator of the smartphone, but the iPhone made it   aspirational to the masses. Netflix wasn't the first upstart to   serve up video streams, but the built-in base of millions of   couch potatoes and its aggressive pricing made it the niche's   undisputed early leader.;Two pretty big ideas;The iPhone and Netflix streaming announcements had a couple of   things in common. They were made in January, but both pointed to   products that would be available in June. The iPhone hit the   market in late June. Netflix would begin rolling out streaming in   beta in the weeks following the original announcement, but it had   also pointed to June for nationwide availability.;Another thing that the iPhone and Netflix streaming have in   common is that they weren't hits out of the gate. The original   iPhone was so expensive that Apple had to institute a $200 price   cut less than three months into retail availability. There was no   App Store, and the camera only took photos. It was only available   through a single wireless carrier. Netflix streaming was   initially limited to just 1,000 films and TV shows, and it could   only be viewed on Windows-based PCs.;Things would go on to change quickly for both offerings. The   App Store launched a year later, boosting the iPhone's   functionality the way that iTunes fortified the iPod. Netflix   became available through internet-tethered Xbox game systems and   Blu-ray players, making it more seamless for subscribers to   stream content through their home theaters.;Toasting the next decade;The iPhone and Netflix streaming are still going strong. The   former may be going through a slump in sales growth, but it   continues to be the driving earnings force for the world's most   valuable consumer tech company. The latter went from offering   streaming a decade ago to its 5.7 million DVD-based subscribers   at no additional cost to an audience of 86.7 million accounts   that are willing to pay for the streaming platform on its   own.;Apple and Netflix have been just as game-changing for its   investors.;Apple stock;has soared 800% since its iPhone announcement. Netflix stock has   soared 4,014% since its niche-defining news. The next 10 years   are unlikely to be as financially rewarding for investors, but   even in a competitive field, the brand and momentum advantages of   Apple and Netflix should continue to serve shareholders well.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Is Wading Into Original Video Content. But Why?;January 17, 2017, 09:15:00 AM EDT;Apple is on the hunt for premium original TV content. Image   source: Apple.;The evidence that;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) is interested in creating original video content   continues to mount. Last week,;The Wall Street Journal;"reported that Apple was looking to build a ""significant"" business   around original TV shows and movies. The Mac maker has reportedly   been in negotiations with experienced Hollywood producers to   potentially acquire rights to TV shows, and may even bring in   marketing and network executives as part of its big push. It   seems Apple is focusing mostly on TV shows right now, but   original movies are also on the table.";"makeArticleAd();";As far as timing goes, Apple could release some of this   original content by the end of this year, and it would be bundled   with and available through Apple Music. The iPhone maker is   unlikely to open its wallet up too much though, and isn't willing   to spend the massive amounts of money that it would take to   really compete directly with other dominant video streaming   services.;A second (official) opinion;Just days later, prominent-music-producer-turned-Apple-exec   Jimmy Iovine seemingly confirmed the plans while speaking at the   Television Critics Association's winter press tour, according to;The Hollywood Reporter;". Iovine acknowledged that Apple Music is going to expand   (emphasis added): ""At Apple Music, what we're trying to create is   an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to   include audio";and video;".""";"Iovine said that Apple is looking to better differentiate from   Spotify and other free online music streaming services, saying   the company was fighting the ""free"" model of ad-supported   services that the industry hates. This approach will undoubtedly   win Apple (more) friends within the music industry, and it helps   to have a heavyweight like Iovine as a sort of an industry   liaison.";The strategy is still murky;I've already said that Apple's;strange fascination with original video content   is misplaced and noncommittal;, yet Apple continues to embark down this path. Even longtime   Apple analyst Horace Dediu recently told;Business Insider;that the notion is largely misguided, believing that Apple is   only looking to do this as a reactive measure as opposed to a   voluntary one.;Simply put, the market value of original content is on the   rise, in part due to perceived value in differentiation, but also   for other strategic reasons. Look no further than the spate of   blockbuster megadeals in recent years that are predicated on   media and content for proof. Apple feels compelled to   participate, even if in a limited and measured way.;The bigger concern and risk to investors is that Apple's   strategy fails to produce the intended results. Are music users   really even that interested in having a small side of exclusive   TV shows? Is the presence of exclusive video content likely to   sway prospective subscribers that are on the fence to pick Apple   Music over Spotify? That doesn't pass the sniff test.;Apple likely recognizes that the current crop of music   streaming services -- including both Apple Music and Spotify --   are relatively commoditized, offering comparable catalogs   licensed from the major record labels. (Apple Music technically   has more songs -- 40 million compared to Spotify's 30 million --   but there should be an overlap with the popular mainstream   content that most people are looking for.) Apple makes it clear   that it's not interested (yet) in moving directly into video   streaming, but adding a tiny bit of exclusive video content to a   music streaming service sounds like a pretty weak   differentiator.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. Supplier Readying for Ramp-Up of New 10-Nanometer Tech;January 15, 2017, 01:10:00 PM EDT;Contract-chip manufacturing giant;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company;(NYSE: TSM) recently announced its earnings results, provided   forward guidance for the current quarter, and provided a lot of   insight on the ramp-up of its next-generation chip-manufacturing   technology, called 10-nanometers (10nm for short).;Image source: TSMC.;"makeArticleAd();";TSMC's new 10nm technology is expected to bring performance,   power, and area benefits compared to its current generation 16nm   technology. Those improvements should allow its customers -- with;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) being a big one -- to develop chips with better   performance and more features than what they could create with   older-generation technologies.;On TSMC's most recent earnings call, company executives   provided some key business and financial insight around its   upcoming 10nm technology.;The big bang comes in the second half of 2017;"TSMC has previously said that it expects to begin production   shipments of its 10nm technology in the first quarter of 2017. On   the call, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang explained that, although   production of 10nm chips will ""start to ramp in the first quarter   [of 2017],"" shipments will ""ramp-up very strongly in the second   half.";TSMC's Lora Ho later said that revenue from 10nm wafers will   exceed 10% of the company's quarterly revenue in the third   quarter of the year. For the full year, she said, TSMC's revenue   from 10nm wafers will make up more than 10% of the company's   yearly revenues -- implying that 10nm shipments during the fourth   quarter of the year will make up much more than 10% of   revenue.;Several mobile-processor makers are expected to use TSMC's   10nm technology in the second half of 2017, including MediaTek (a   low-cost mobile chipmaker that aspires to gain traction in the   high end of the market), HiSilicon (Huawei's chip-development   arm), and of course, Apple.;Apple is likely to be far and away the largest customer of   TSMC 10nm wafers. Apple's iPhone volume is likely to shift very   quickly to the next-generation models powered by 10nm chips, and   Apple's iPhone is the highest-volume premium smartphone in the   market.;TSMC builds the A-series chips that Apple designs for the   iPhone, as well as several chips designed by Apple's suppliers.   Image source: Apple.;"The revenue-ramp profile that TSMC is talking about here --   small volumes in the first half of 2017; large volumes in the   second half of 2017 -- is consistent with Apple's established   iPhone-release schedule.";Great market-share expectations;"Chang offered some commentary around his market-share   expectations for its 10nm technology. He said that, a year-ago,   he ""vowed then that every new [manufacturing] node from now on   will have a market share higher than our market share on 16   [nm].""";"Chang didn't give a specific market share figure for the   company's 16nm technology, but estimated it at between 65% and   70%. He then told analyst Mehdi Hosseini that TSMC is confident   that the company's share of the 10nm market would ""very   definitely"" be above 65%.""";Gross margin impact of 10nm transition;Ahead of new manufacturing-technology introductions, TSMC   generally tells investors that, as those new technologies   ramp-up, they'll dilute the company's consolidated gross profit   margins for quite a few quarters.;TSM Gross Profit Margin (TTM);data by;YCharts;.;The transition to 10nm will be no different.

11 Tech Products That'll Be Obsolete by 2025;January 15, 2017, 11:00:00 AM EDT;If there's one thing that's constant in the world of   technology, it's change. And almost without exception, that   change inevitably applies to tech products that at one time   seemed crucial to maintaining our current standards of   living.;So which are next in line for obsolescence? Read on to see why   I think the following tech products stand a good chance of being   obsolete by the time 2025 rolls around.;"makeArticleAd();";LG's new W-Series OLED TV, Image source: LG Electronics;1. LCD TVs;A little over a decade ago, increasingly available liquid   crystal display (LCD) televisions took the world by storm with   their delightfully thin physical profiles and energy efficiency.   And while LCD TVs have certainly improved since then, becoming   even thinner, brighter, and cheaper, manufacturers such as;LG;are already ramping up their production capacities for a   superior successor: Organic light emitting diode (OLED) TVs.;Because OLEDs emit their own light and don't require a   backlight, they boast;even;greater energy efficiency and picture quality than LCD TVs. They   can also be made paper thin, semi-transparent, flexible, and   even;rollable;". At CES 2017 this month, LG even confirmed its new W-series TV   (the ""W"" stands for ""wallpaper"") is only";one-tenth;of an inch thick, mounts to your wall with magnetic brackets, and   will hit stores later this year.;2. LED lightbulbs;Philips Lumiblade OLED lamps, IMAGE SOURCE: PHILIPS.;Relatedly, though traditional LED light bulbs are finally   becoming more affordable relative to their older fluorescent   counterparts, I think the lighting industry could be further   disrupted as OLED lighting becomes more common. After all, while   LEDs are a pointed, directional light source, OLEDs are similarly   cool to the touch while also distributing beautiful, even light   that's highly energy efficient. And similar to OLED TVs, OLED   lights can be made in a variety of thin and curved form   factors.;In fact, the disruptive potential of OLED lighting caught my   eye when it was;still in its early stages;in late 2014, when I noted it would take years for   manufacturers such as;Philips;and Germany's OSRAM to further improve OLED light pricing   and energy efficiency to match that of today's power-sipping LED   bulbs. OLED lighting remains in those early stages today, but   should gain momentum as it continues to improve and more   manufacturers adopt it in the coming years.;3. Physical storage media;Next, it's no mystery that optical storage media such as CDs   and DVDs are quickly going away, as many consumers today prefer   to transfer larger files with things such as USB flash drives and   external hard drives. But even those physical storage mediums are   likely to disappear given the increased prevalence and   convenience of cloud storage services.;And why not? Whether you're connected to your Wi-Fi at home or   using your LTE connection through your smartphone, Internet   speeds have only continued to increase along with file sizes. And   companies like;Box;,;Amazon;, and Google already offer compelling, affordable (or free)   cloud-based storage services making it easy to upload and access   those files wherever you have a connection.;4. Gaming consoles;It might be hard to envision a world without dedicated gaming   consoles such as the Xbox One or PlayStation 4. But if companies   such as;NVIDIA;(NASDAQ: NVDA) have anything to do with it, console-free,   cloud-based gaming will take over in the coming years.;Consider, for example, NVIDIA's GeForce Now game-streaming   service, which allows gamers to instantly stream more than 100   AAA games instantly at 60 frames per second and 1080 resolution,   all with ultra-low latency and without requiring updates or   downloads. In short, the games are hosted on NVIDIA's own   remote servers, and powered by its Kepler-based GPUs and Tegra   processors. This allows NVIDIA to introduce the latest gaming   technology as soon as it's available rather than requiring   consumers to go out and purchase new hardware.;5. Automotive mirrors;Image source: Gentex;"Of course, car mirrors aren't exactly what most people would   consider a ""tech product,"" with the notable exception of   automatically dimming mirrors from companies such as";Gentex;(NASDAQ: GNTX) . But Gentex has also touted;increasing adoption of its full-display   mirror;product in recent quarters, with five OEMs so far sourcing the   company as a supplier of the new product for their respective   vehicles.;Add to that a U.S. Department of Transportation rule put in   place last year that will require back-up cameras in all new cars   by May 2018, as well as the increasing prevalence of self-driving   vehicles, and there soon won't be a need for today's low-tech   mirrors.;6. Wired chargers;Samsung;(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) has already incorporated wireless induction   charging into its latest and greatest smartphones -- just set the   phone down on a pad and let it charge, no plugs or adapters   required. And the latest rumors surrounding;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming flagship smartphone indicate the folks   in Cupertino are;set to follow suit;later this year, adding wireless charging capabilities to the   iPhone line for the first time in company history. It seems only   fair, then, to assume other manufacturers will follow suit as   consumers grow accustomed to the relative convenience of wireless   charging in the next few years.;Looking even further ahead, research teams have also   identified opportunities to capture the small amount of;power transmitted through Wi-Fi signals;and use it to charge an array of different devices without any   physical contact at all.;Amazon's Echo Dot, IMAGE SOURCE: AMAZON.COM;7. Remote controls;Long a staple of living room entertainment, the days of   dedicated remote controls are nearly over thanks to the advent of   voice-operated devices that can accomplish the same tasks.;For instance, I can already quite literally ask the Kinect   sensor plugged into my Xbox One to adjust my TV's volume, change   the channel, open any game, or power down the system. And   it's hardly surprising;Amazon;Echo was Amazon.com's;best-selling device in all of 2016;. The hands-free, voice-controlled product allows users to do   everything from ordering a pizza to playing music, calling a ride   from Uber, controlling their smart-home devices, and buying items   from Amazon.com itself, to name only a few.;8. Physical credit cards;According to Bloomberg, over 80% of consumer spending in the   U.S. is already cashless. And thanks to services like;PayPal;and Apple Pay, completing those cashless transactions   increasingly doesn't even require a physical credit card to be   present. What's more, with countries like India;rapidly shifting away from cash;, and given the rapid proliferation of smartphones with access to   the aforementioned digital payment services on a global scale, I   won't be the least bit surprised if plastic credit cards   represent little more than unnecessary wallet-thickeners in   another eight years.;9. Passwords;To be fair, a password isn't exactly a tech product. But try   telling that to the suppliers of biometric sensors that have   already started to replace the alphanumeric character passwords   on many of today's smartphones and laptops. The right fingerprint   placed on your iPhone, for example, does everything from   unlocking the device to signing into your credit card provider's   app, or making monetary purchases through the app store. Over the   longer term, facial recognition technology -- similar to, say,   the surprisingly accurate suggestions within;Facebook;"'s ""tag friends"" feature in your photos -- will be able to more   effectively distinguish between individuals on a live basis and   grant permissions accordingly.";10. Media streaming devices;"As useful and popular as media streaming devices like   Chromecast, Roku, Fire TV, and Apple TV have become, their   utility will only fade as their core functionality -- that is, to   turn any TV into a ""smart"" TV -- is increasingly built into a   higher number of new television sets. According to IHS, more than   half of all TV sets shipped globally last year were smart TVs,   and that number should continue to grow going forward. As it   does, the number of dedicated media streaming devices shipped   will fall.";11. Upright vacuums;Image source: iRobot;Finally, traditional vacuums will likely continue to lose   share to their smaller robotic cousins. To be sure, in 2014;iRobot;"(NASDAQ: IRBT) CEO Colin Angle noted the robotic vacuum cleaner   market accounted for around 15% of total global vacuum sales.   That might not sound impressive, but Angle elaborated that this   share was roughly similar to ""other disruptive household   appliances such as the microwave oven and dishwasher at the same   stage in their life cycles, 10 to 15 years following   introduction.""";"Angle added, ""We believe that as awareness of the category   continues to expand, we could see an adoption rate similar to   those other appliances.""";And iRobot hasn't slowed down since.;Consumer robot revenue;in its most recent quarter climbed 23% year over year, to $168   million. That included 13.3% growth in domestic home robot sales,   to $65.5 million, thanks to strong demand for its high-end   Roombas, as well as greater than 30% growth internationally, as   iRobot delivered early Roomba and Braava floor sweeping robot   shipments to a new Chinese distributor.;Over the long term, as more consumers realize robotic vacuums   are a viable replacement for their manual upright models, I   suspect traditional vacuums will collect dust in a very different   way.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

How Vending Machine Technology Can Boost Fastenal’s Growth;January 14, 2017, 03:44:43 PM EDT;Fastenal;(;FAST;) is emerging to be one of the most promising companies involved in the vending machine industry. While it sees itself as an industrial supplies company, Fastenal has over the last eight years encroached in the technology sector with a key focus on vending machine technologies.;Founded in 1967 and incorporated a year later, Fastenal begun by selling mostly fasteners such as screws, threaded rods and nuts, which are used in construction and manufacturing.;The company has since expanded its portfolio of products, bringing its total product offering to more than 690,000 alongside a variety of services, including inventory management, SKUs, vending and machining.;"makeArticleAd();";Fastenal does not develop its own products, but rather it sells products manufactured by other companies. It acts as a facilitator in the distribution chain by helping customers to find specific products for specified needs.;After diversifying its offerings, it has managed to redesign its growth model, which now seeks to capitalize on evolving technologies in the consumer market.;The company has seen a significant growth in revenues and net income over the last seven years, with the top line growing from $2 billion to nearly $4 billion without breaks. On the other hand, the bottom line managed to increase from about $184 million to more than $510 million in the same time, again illustrating the milestones gained since the company launched its first vending machine in 2008.;Vending machines industry outlook;Right now, companies are trying to develop innovative ways of dispensing products in small units in a bid to initiating valuable customer engagements with their products. While;Coca-Cola;(;KO;) has for many years been one of the leading companies in the dispensing technology market, more players have joined the lot and now, even the likes;Apple;(;AAPL;) have begun to see the sense in vending technologies.;Coca-Cola allows people to purchase a variety of its drinks from vending machines located across the world in retail malls, restaurants and cafes rather than buying the already packaged products. With such access, customers can mix hundreds of flavors to their desired quantities to come up with unique cocktails.;Apple, on the other hand, has placed its vending machines at strategic locations such as airports and high-end hotels. These are places that could give consumers ample time to take a closer look at the products.;Vending machines are common in food products, cosmetics, snacks and pharmaceuticals, but based on recent developments, tech devices, tools and fasteners also appear to be taking their place in the cue. The industry is attracting players from all over the world as it continues to gain traction across several markets.;One of the latest vending machine innovations comes from Chile, a nation that is firmly on its way up towards reaching developed country status. Entrepreneurship is driving growth in the private sector as investors continue to find ways of alleviating some of the common hygiene issues in urban centers. Algramo is a Santiago, Chile-based company founded by Jose Manuel Moller and Salvador Achondo. The company is trying to cut the costs of various products by taking the packaging out of the equation.;Instead, it uses small re-usable containers which consumers can fill with various products from their vending machines that are installed across major cities in the country. Consumers can buy various cereals including lentils, chickpeas and rice, as well as common cleaning detergents from the vending machines.;How is Fastenal positioning in the market?;These developments indicate that the future of vending technologies remains bright and companies that have invested heavily in the industry could reap the benefits within the next few years. As discussed at the beginning, Fastenal is one of the main players, and as per recent reports, the company has already launched more than 60,000 vending machines in North America.;Fastenal is fine-tuning its strategy for vending machines by incorporating internet sales such that whenever one of its vending machines is running out of supplies, restocking can be ordered instantly. This helps in maintaining optimum levels for each product in the machine. The company can also engage with its customers to know which products are in high demand for a given vending machine at a certain location, thereby enabling it to manage the inventory respectively.;Conclusion;Fastenal may not be involved directly with other players in the vending machine business like Apple, Coca-Cola and Algramo. However, the fact that more companies are joining the industry means that it's gaining popularity.;This will trigger a knock-on effect on companies that could be interested in Fastenal's vending machines. If most people are using vending machine technologies, then it would become a norm amongst businesses eventually.;Disclosure:;I have no position in any stock mentioned in this article.;Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.;Premium Members;This article first appeared on;GuruFocus;.
Dow 30 Stock Roundup: American Express Buys InAuth, Visa Inks Deal with Wal-Mart;January 13, 2017, 06:02:00 PM EDT;The Dow declined over the week even as investors were disappointed by Donald Trump's first news conference in months. The President elect provided few details about how he would go about executing his economic promises. Instead, he chose to lash out at exorbitant drug prices and at U.S. spy and news agencies over what he called a 'phony' Russia dossier. Oil prices continued to remain volatile and exerted a significant impact on energy shares as well as the broader market.;Last Week's Performance;The Dow increased 0.3% last Friday following a solid December U.S. jobs report. The U.S. added 156,000 jobs in December, below the consensus estimate of 178,000 job additions. But, a sharp upward revision of November's job numbers and a slight trimming of October's job numbers indicated that employment growth was more or less in line with broader expectations.;Steady gains in employment have pushed workers' pay higher, with average hourly wages climbing 0.4% in December. This in turn pushed the annual gain last year to 2.9%, the fastest rise since the economy started to recover in mid-2009.The unemployment rate, meantime, ticked up to 4.7% from 4.6% in November, matching the consensus expectation. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit increased about 7% in November as imports touched the highest level in almost a year.;The index gained 1% over last week. Benchmarks closed in positive territory for the week following encouraging auto sales data and release of Fed minutes. Additionally, encouraging manufacturing and construction spending data had a positive impact on investor sentiment.;The Dow;This;Week;The index lost 0.4% on Monday led by declines in energy shares. A decline in;oil prices;dragged energy shares down. Oil prices tumbled almost 4% on Monday after record Iraqi crude exports raised concerns that OPEC's initiative to trim abundant supply of oil would be undermined. Rise in active U.S. oil rigs also hinted at further increase in crude production levels. According to Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil jumped by 4 to 529 rigs last week, marking the tenth weekly climb in a row.;The index declined again on Tuesday, moving 0.2% lower as investors mostly remained cautious ahead of a news conference by President-elect Donald Trump, to be held on Wednesday, his first since being elected on Nov 8. Beyond Trump's comments, investors also eagerly awaited the commencement of the earnings season and whether it could provide some support to the recent Trump-induced market rally.;"The index increased 0.5% on Wednesday following President-elect Donald Trump's first news conference in months. Energy shares were among the day's biggest gainers, thanks to rise in oil prices. OPEC's decision to trim production levels along with expectations of strong demand growth in China helped oil prices move north. Healthcare shares, on the other hand, finished in the red after Trump said that pharma companies are ""getting away with murder"" by charging exorbitant drug prices.";The index closed lower on Thursday, losing 0.3% Thursday after President-elect Donald Trump provided little clarity on economic policies during his first news conference on Wednesday. Trump offered no details on tax cuts and infrastructure outlays that had powered a record-breaking rally over the last two months.  Investors began to question the run-up in stock prices following Trump's promises of fiscal stimulus measures even as they gear up for the start of the earnings season.;Components;Moving;the Index;American Express Company;AXP;acquired Boston, MA-based mobile device authentication and intelligence solutions provider, InAuth, Inc.

The latest acquisition follows an investment in InAuth, made earlier this year, by a strategic investment wing of American Express. (Read:;American Express Buys InAuth to Boost Digital Security;);In a separate development, last week, American Express released the delinquency and write-off rate statistics for its U.S. Consumer Services (USCS) and U.S. Small Business card member loans, for the month of Nov 2016.;Total USCS card member loans increased 2.6% from the preceding month and 4% from the prior-year period to $46.7 billion in Nov 2016. The 30-day plus delinquency rate remained unchanged at 1.1%, from both the comparable periods. Net write-off rate for the month was 1.5%, down 10 basis points (bps), from the preceding month as well as year over year. (Read:;American Express' Delinquency Rate Flat Y/Y in November;);Apple Inc.;AAPL;recently announced that its App Store generated record sales of more than $20 billion for developers in 2016, up almost 40% from 2015.

Notably, Zacks Rank #3 rated Apple keeps 30% of all App Store sales. (Read:;Apple's (AAPL) App Store Reports Record Sales for 2016;);Meanwhile, per media reports, declining iPhone sales have resulted in Apple cutting CEO Tim Cook's compensation.

Looking to Buy Stocks? Here Are 3 to Start With;January 13, 2017, 04:31:00 PM EDT;In both bull and bear markets, it's never too late to buy   stocks. Picking the right stocks to buy, of course, is the   biggest challenge. For investors looking to buy stocks today,   here are three that look enticing.;Image source: Getty Images.;"makeArticleAd();";Buying stocks;Why buy stocks in the first place?;By buying stocks, investors position themselves to not only   save money but to potentially watch their money grow, whether   it's through share price appreciation, dividends, or both. Yes,   buying stocks is a risk. But it is also an opportunity. It gives   investors a chance to earn excellent returns.;"Finally, investors should keep in mind that there is never a   ""right"" time to buy stocks. Since attempting to time when the   market will rise or fall has proved to be impossible for anyone   to do consistently, the best thing investors can do is maximize   their time";in;the market, giving themselves the greatest opportunity to watch   their portfolios' value rise over time.;Ready to buy stocks? Start here;Image source: Getty Images.;1. Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL);:;It's no secret that stock valuations are currently a bit   exorbitant. Indeed, the average price-to-earnings ratio of stocks   in the;S&P 500;today is 25, up from about 22 one year ago. This makes   conservatively priced stocks that also happen to be excellent   businesses rarer than usual. Nevertheless, they're still hanging   around -- and Apple is one of them.;With a P/E ratio of just 14, Apple gives investors an   opportunity to buy a stock with a leading position in its key   markets without paying a premium price. In addition,;Apple stock;shareholders get a nice dividend yield (annual dividend payments   per share as a percentage of the stock price) of 1.9%.;2. Costco;(NASDAQ: COST;);:;With Costco stock, investors will have to pay a greater premium   for the company's earnings than they'll have to pay for Apple.   Costco stock has a P/E ratio of about 30. But there's good   reason for Costco's steep valuation: Not only has the company   carved out a strong, enduring competitive advantage for itself by   gaining a cost advantage through economies of scale and wildly   efficient operations, but management has also consistently   improved operations. This is particularly evident by Costco's   swelling net profit margin, which has increased from 1.7% to 2%   between 2012 and 2016 -- a big and important gain for a warehouse   bulk retailer.;3. Berkshire Hathaway;(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B);:;Last, it would be a shame to overlook the conglomerate built by   the world's greatest investor himself, Warren Buffett. Under the   Berkshire Hathaway name, Buffett has built up a portfolio of   enduring subsidiaries and stock holdings poised to stand the test   of time. Under Berkshire's ownership are built-to-last   subsidiaries like Geico, Duracell, and Burlington Northern Santa   Fe Railway. And some of Berkshire's largest stock holdings   include iconic businesses like;Coca-Cola;,;American Express;, and;Wells Fargo;.;Image source: Getty Images.;Of course, when it comes to buying stocks, there's no   guarantee. Historically, however, stocks have proved to be well   worth the risk, compounding at approximately 10% annually over   the last 100 years when dividends are reinvested. While it's   impossible to know whether these three stocks could yield a   similar 10% average annualized return in the coming years, buying   these stocks will likely give investors a good chance of seeing   an outcome like this.;10 stocks we like better than Berkshire       Hathaway;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Nintendo (NTDOY) Stock Falls On Nintendo Switch Launch Details;January 13, 2017, 04:30:00 PM EDT;Shares of Nintendo;NTDOY;fell more nearly 6% on Friday-hitting their lowest point of 2017-following the company's announcement of the launch details for its new Nintendo Switch console. The device will hit stores on March 3 for a starting price of $299.;2016 ended rather poorly for Nintendo, and it looks like investors are not convinced that the Switch will help turn things around. Many were surprised about the price point, as it seems the market was expecting the Switch to be priced lower than the Nintendo Wii U console, which also retails for $299.;Nintendo investors are desperate for the company to regain its console market share and win back some of the casual gamers that have abandoned consoles altogether. Less than a decade ago, Nintendo's original Wii systems were flying off the shelves, and Nintendo had a 60% share of the console market. Today, Nintendo's console market share is at about 25%.;Shifting consumer behavior has had a huge impact on Nintendo, which has thrived as the casual gamer's top choice for years. However, these less-serious gamers are simply opting to get their fix through smartphone games nowadays, and that has left Nintendo reeling.;In fact, Nintendo was specifically hesitant to get into the smartphone gaming business for some time. Only recently did the company lease its Pokemon franchise to Niantic, Inc. for use in the groundbreaking augmented reality smartphone game Pokemon Go.;While investors rewarded Nintendo with skyrocketing share prices after the success of Pokemon Go, the excitement didn't last long as interest in the game sputtered and Nintendo admitted it wouldn't generate much revenue from the game.;Nevertheless, investors were excited to see Nintendo debut its infamous Mario character on Apple's;AAPL;"iTunes App Store recently. Nintendo's ""Super Mario Run"" quickly climbed to the top of the iTunes charts.";Regardless, Nintendo's focus is now on the launch of the Nintendo Switch, and the company better hope the console is a success.

Warren Buffett's Best Dividend Stocks for 2017;January 13, 2017, 02:23:00 PM EDT;Warren Buffett-run;Berkshire Hathaway;(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) has a portfolio filled with the   stocks of some of the best companies in the U.S. As we head into   2017, here are two examples from Berkshire's holdings that pay   strong dividends with room for growth that could be great choices   for your dividend portfolio right now.;Image source: The Motley Fool.;"makeArticleAd();";Plenty of room for dividend growth;I mentioned in a recent article that one of the investments   I'd like to see Buffett and company make in 2017 is to   double-down on;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Currently, Berkshire's Apple stake is relatively   small, in comparison with some of its other stock investments,   but I feel it represents one of the best values among all of   Berkshire's stocks.;Image source: The Motley Fool.;Apple is one of my biggest stock investments, and there are   several reasons why. First, it's cheap. I know that argument has   been overused when discussing Apple, but it's true. At just 13.2   times 2017's expected earnings, the market isn't pricing in too   much future growth, but Apple's earnings per share is projected   to grow by 8% in 2017 and 12% in 2018. Apple's free cash flow   grew 23% year over year in the most recent quarter, and the   portion of its revenue coming from services such as Apple Music   and Apple Pay continues to climb at impressive rates.;Plus, with a massive pile of cash parked overseas and an   incoming president who pledged to offer a foreign-profit   repatriation discount to corporations, Apple could be on the   prowl for value-adding acquisitions in the coming years. In fact,   CEO Tim Cook said in September that billions of dollars in   foreign profits were already planned to be transferred home in   2017, and that was before Donald Trump was elected.;As far as the dividend goes, it's completely understandable   that Apple's 1.9% yield doesn't get many income seekers excited,   but it's important to realize that the current payout represents   just 28% of Apple's trailing-12-month earnings. This means that   there is a lot of room for the dividend to grow, and Apple has   made it clear that it intends to increase its dividend every   year, which it has done at an impressive 10.7% annualized rate   since it started paying dividends in 2012.;Still the best-run big bank;Wells Fargo;(NYSE: WFC) is one of Berkshire's largest stock investments, with   a stake valued just shy of $26 million as of this writing. It is   one of the best dividend payers in the banking industry with a   yield of 2.8%.;Image source: The Motley Fool.;The bank was also among the sector's worst performers in 2016   -- rival;Bank of America;rose by 33% and;U.S. Bancorp;rose by 20%, while Wells Fargo managed to increase by a paltry   1.4%, mainly due to its fake-accounts scandal that was revealed   in September. Wells Fargo has experienced a considerable drop in   new accounts and customer confidence in the months that followed,   but it's unclear how much of a lasting impact the scandal will   have once it becomes more of a distant memory.;About two months after news of the scandal broke, Buffett;said;that he had not sold a single share of the bank, nor did he plan   to. This caught many people by surprise, as Buffett has been   quick to get out of investments in the past when he felt a   company's reputation was compromised.;"While Buffett acknowledges that the scandal and the incentive   system that caused it were big mistakes, he calls the bank an   ""incredible institution."" When it comes to Wells Fargo, Buffett   simply believes the good outweighs the bad, and I'm in complete   agreement.";"The company took appropriate measures to learn and recover   from the scandal, including leadership changes, termination of   its unhealthy sales culture, and firing the 5,300 employees who   participated in the wrongdoing. The bank remains the best of the   ""big four"" in terms of asset quality and profitability. It has   earned consistently better returns on equity and assets than   peers, and there's no reason to believe the fallout from the   scandal will change that.";WFC Return on Equity (TTM);data by;YCharts;.;Approach these stocks like Buffett does;"Warren Buffett has famously said that ""our favorite holding   period is forever"" in reference to Berkshire's stock investments.   Of course, Buffett doesn't hold all of his stocks forever -- in   fact, Berkshire sells stocks all the time. If his reasons for   buying a stock no longer apply, or if there's some other reason   he's no longer interested in a stock as an investment, Buffett is   completely willing to cash in his chips.";The point is that you should approach these investments as if   you're going to hold them forever. Buying high-quality,   dividend-paying stocks is perhaps the most certain path to wealth   you can take, so buy these with the long haul in mind.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

The Second Time's the Charm: Apple AirPods Sprint Out of the Gate;January 13, 2017, 01:58:00 PM EDT;Just don't lose them. Image source: Apple.;What's old is new again.;"makeArticleAd();";A decade ago, Bluetooth headsets were all the rage.;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) launched its initial foray into Bluetooth headsets   in 2007 alongside the original iPhone, priced at $129. The   company subsequently reduced the price to $99 before quietly   discontinuing the device in 2009.;Remember this old thing? Image source: Apple.;With last month's launch of the (delayed) AirPods, Apple hopes   to usher in a sort of renaissance in wireless headphones, not   unlike the tablet renaissance that it kicked off in 2010 with the   iPad. So far, it's working.;Survey says;E-commerce analytics specialist Slice Intelligence released a;report;earlier this week, suggesting that Apple's AirPods are sprinting   out of the gate following the launch in December. While that's a   couple months late relative to the original target launch of   October, the AirPods are making up for lost time. Slice notes   that an overwhelming 75% of all headphones sold online in   December were of the wireless flavor, and there was a noticeable   spike in sales on the day the AirPods went on sale.;Image source: Slice Intelligence.;Following the launch, AirPods now comprise 26% of all online   revenue for wireless headphones. Apple's other headphones brand,   Beats, also grabs another big chunk of the market, with 15%   revenue share following the AirPods launch. That means that Apple   represents over 40% of the market in terms of revenue.   Considering Apple's premium pricing with both AirPods and Beats,   the company is likely grabbing a disproportionate share of   revenue relative to unit share.;Image source: Slice Intelligence.;Even before the AirPods launch, Beats was the dominant brand   by far, with 24% of revenue share. Beats' strong position in the   premium headphone space, which was mostly a function of marketing;instead of product quality;, was always one of the key motivators for the 2014   acquisition.;There's more where that came from;Slice's data is even more impressive when you consider how   severely supply constrained AirPods have been and continue to be.   If AirPods have been able to grab that much of the market   immediately, even though Apple is still unable to sufficiently   fulfill demand, that's a good sign for Apple's wireless audio   ambitions. New orders placed on Apple's online store are quoted   shipping times of six weeks.;It's unfortunate that AirPods mostly sat on the sidelines   during the bulk of the holiday shopping season due to severely   limited availability, but in all likelihood, those are simply   delayed sales instead of lost sales. Apple users are particularly   loyal and willing to endure waiting instead of defecting to   another brand. That's especially true since AirPods include a   number of integrated software features that are designed   specifically for Apple devices -- features that differentiate   AirPods from other headphones.;Maybe Bluetooth headphones are here to stay this time   around.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Don’t Sweat Analysts’ Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factory;January 13, 2017, 01:05:41 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Earlier this week,;Tesla Motors Inc;(NASDAQ:;TSLA;) finally put its ballyhooed gigafactory into motion, beginning the production of;lithium-ion batteries in Sparks, Nevada;"in front of a crowd of a few hundred interested parties. TSLA stock soared on the heels of the event, of course, jumping nearly 5% the day it officially flipped the switch to ""on,"" and then continued to rally. Indeed, Tesla stock has rallied 27% since early November, mostly in anticipation of the milestone event.";Source: Shutterstock;And yet, while the market and most retail investors were clearly impressed, more than a handful of analysts weren't. Their concerns?;"makeArticleAd();";A lack of fiscal details about how the battery plant will impact the company's books, for one. Another worry was about the sheer cost of the facility itself. Still another was whether the Model 3 may not be profitable when it finally goes into production.;With all due respect to those professionals, you want to start worrying about these things now?;Now?!?;Yes. No. Maybe.;Just for the record, yes, I'm the same guy who's been more critical than constructive on Tesla Motors over the years (like;here;,;here;and;here;).;"7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     Bank";But, my pessimism was never to suggest that Tesla's take on electric vehicles wasn't game-changing. The company;has;mainstreamed EVs. Its cars;are;"engineering marvels. My concerns were simply rooted in the notion that most investors had unrealistic expectations; the masses couldn't distinguish between Tesla Motors being a trade or an investment.";In retrospect, it's not clear if the analyst community was able to distinguish between the two either.;Take the comments from Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino as an example.;He said;, following Tuesday's event at the facility:;"""Overall we found the tour helpful in illustrating the layout and process for manufacturing lithium ion battery cells and packs for its automotive and energy products. However, there was a lack of quantitative updates for 2017 and the ramp expectations.""";Fair enough. Just bear in mind, however, that Goldman;"upgraded Tesla stock to a ""buy"" in May of last year";"- when the battery factory was well underway - with analyst Patrick Archambault commenting ""We do not believe Tesla shares are fully capturing the company's disruptive potential.""";"So … is Tesla any less disruptive now that it's making its own batteries en masse? The stock isn't any higher now than it was then, but Goldman's current rating on TSLA is ""neutral.""";Granted, Goldman was just days away from underwriting another secondary offering of TSLA stock in May but the company didn't know any;less;about the math of the gigafactory than it knows now. The only real difference between then and now is the stock's price.;Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas was also worried about Tesla's lack of fiscal details now that the factory is in production, just as much as he's worried that another round of fundraising is in the cards. Again, however, that's nothing new for Tesla Motors, and it wasn't a problem for Jonas back in 2014 when he doubled Morgan Stanley's price target on TSLA stock, to $320 per share.;He noted;at the time:;"""If it can be a leader in commercializing battery packs, investors may never look at Tesla the same way again … Tesla says it will team up with partners to build the world's largest Li-ion battery pack facility in the US. We reflect the potential for lower battery costs through higher sales volume nearly doubling Tesla's share of the global car market to 90bps by 2028, driving our target increase.""";Tesla;is;"clearly going to have that ""world's largest Li-ion battery pack facility"" Jonas was stoked about three years ago. And, there's at least a";little;"more clarity now than there was then. Yet, Morgan Stanley's current rating on Tesla stock is a modest ""equal weight"" despite clear progress being made since the 2014 call that said such progress would be compelling.";The stock never even threatened to reach $320.;And that's when it hits you … some (though not all) analysts are just taking their best guess on TSLA, being;led by;the rhetoric rather than;leading;the rhetoric.;To be fair, that's what analyst do.;And it's not easy.;Opinions should be updated as new information surfaces.;On the other hand, the ebb and flow between quantitative and qualitative analysis from some analysts has made it tough for investors to digest those professional insights. The things that didn't matter before - like profits or perpetual fund-raising - can't be too big of a deal for the stock now.;Here's Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Dominated     Holiday Sales;In other words, don't sweat the naysayers' opinions too much.;Bottom Line for TSLA Stock;"None of this is to suggest TSLA is inevitably going to skyrocket higher, nor is it to imply Tesla stock is doomed; the actual outcome is apt to be somewhere in between the two extreme opinions. It's simply to point out that of all the reasons you may want to worry about owning Tesla shares, the lackluster response from analysts regarding the gigafactory is the least of them. Those guys are largely expected to say something in response to milestone events, and many of the pessimistic comments were off-the-cuff sound bites not meant to be taken as a complete analysis.";As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print     Money;7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017;The post;Don't Sweat Analysts' Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factory;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.
5 Smart Investing Moves to Make in 2017;January 13, 2017, 12:35:00 PM EDT;As a new year starts, investors have likely had time to   reflect on their stock market triumphs and failures in 2016. In   2017, many of the old challenges will persist as new ones emerge.   Let's take a closer look at five things investors should do this   year to stay ahead of the market.;Image source: Getty Images.;"makeArticleAd();";1. Keep an eye on interest rates;U.S. interest rates are widely expected to rise  next   year, which could impact your portfolio in three big ways. First,;dividend   stocks;could become less attractive than bonds as yields rise -- meaning   that income stocks with historically high multiples;could tumble;. One vulnerable stock is tobacco giant;Altria;(NYSE: MO) , which currently pays a forward yield of 3.6% but   trades at 26 times trailing earnings -- which is much higher than   its industry average of 21.;Second, higher interest rates make it harder for companies to   boost their earnings with debt-fueled buybacks. Companies like;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) and;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) might suffer because they fund their buybacks with   debt, but companies like;Texas Instruments;(NASDAQ: TXN) -- which fully funds its buybacks with its free   cash flow -- won't be affected. Higher interest rates could also   reduce M&A activity due to higher borrowing costs. Lastly,   higher interest rates will boost the profitability of banks,   because they make savings accounts more attractive while boosting   the interest collected on outstanding loans.;2. Mind the U.S. dollar;The strong U.S. dollar, which could rise further with higher   interest rates, could hurt multinational companies that generate   a large percentage of their revenue overseas. This means that   many blue chip stocks, like;Procter & Gamble;,;Coca-Cola;, and;IBM;", could report widening disparities between their constant   currency and ""as reported"" growth.";"However, a strong U.S. dollar might make ""All American"" stocks   which generate most of their revenue domestically more attractive   than their multinational counterparts -- provided that their   growth remains steady and valuations stay reasonable.";3. Understand the regulatory pressures;In addition to a strong dollar, regulatory pressures both at   home and abroad could punish multinational companies. Back at   home, President-elect Donald Trump has called out companies like   Apple and;General Motors;(NYSE: GM) for relying too heavily on overseas labor. If these   companies are forced to relocate their manufacturing facilities   back to the U.S., their operating expenses could surge and hurt   their bottom line growth.;U.S. companies could also keep struggling in China, where   protectionist regulators have slapped American companies like   Qualcomm,;Microsoft;, and General Motors with probes and fines over allegedly   anti-competitive practices. Investors should keep a close eye on   these moves, but they shouldn't panic and dump these stocks on   just a few negative headlines.;4. Don't chase stocks you don't understand;These issues and other factors are causing big investors to   rotate out of certain sectors and into others. For example, many   institutional investors are buying energy stocks due to higher;oil   prices;, and financial stocks in expectation of rising interest   rates.;They've also been selling some big tech stocks like;Facebook;,;Amazon;,;Netflix;, and;Alphabet;. That herd-like mentality boosted many major energy and   financial stocks over the past few months, but investors   shouldn't follow that lead if they don't understand those stocks   or sectors.;5. Simply do nothing;"Buying and holding stocks isn't the same as buying and   forgetting. Responsible investors should keep up with the latest   news about interest rates, the dollar, and regulatory challenges,   but they shouldn't sell their stocks based on headlines alone.   Instead, the best move you can make in 2017 might be to simply   sit still and stop trading your stocks. After all, Peter Lynch   famously told  investors that a ""watched stock never   boils.""";Unless something drastic happens, like the Trump   Administration slapping companies with a 45% tax on  goods   manufactured in China, you may be better off simply holding your   existing stocks -- provided that you did your due diligence   before buying them.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

Here’s Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Dominated Holiday Sales;January 13, 2017, 12:07:02 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Headphones are always a popular gift and last year was no exception. What;did;change in 2016 was the makeup of headphone sales. In December, 75% of U.S. online headphone purchases were wireless this year. And since the launch of its AirPods wireless earbuds,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) captured over 41% of the wireless headphone market.;Source: Slice Intelligence;Slice Intelligence;published a report;based on U.S. online shopping for headphones, covering the month of December, 2016. That's the critical holiday shopping month and also, the month that Apple finally launched its delayed AirPods wireless earbuds.;"makeArticleAd();";The results show that consumers are ditching the wires and AAPL is quickly dominating the wireless headphone market.;How big was Apple's win? Let's start with traditional wired headphones versus wireless (Bluetooth) headphones.;The Big AirPods Win for AAPL;AAPL took considerable heat last year for essentially forcing new iPhone buyers to make the move to wireless when it;eliminated the traditional headphone jack on the iPhone 7;. Based on the Slice data, it seems like there was a lot of unnecessary hand-wringing over that move.;Apple Inc. (AAPL) MacBook Pro Out of Consumer     Reports' Doghouse;In the 2015, holiday shopping season, wired and wireless headphones tied for popularity, but in 2016, wireless accounted for 75% of all online headphone sales. That growth represents an overall consumer movement toward wireless headphones - it's much too large a shift to be accounted for just by iPhone 7 sales.;The big news for AAPL is that its first Apple-branded wireless headphones - the Apple AirPods -  sold so well since their release (capturing 26% of sales) that they instantly vaulted Apple into first place as a headphone manufacturer. In fact, the AirPods' Dec. 13 release date became the single largest day for online headphone sales for all of 2016, at more than 10 times the average volume.;When you add in sales for Beats (which Apple owns), APPL's wireless headphones dominance becomes even more impressive. The release of the AirPods took some wind out of Beats sales, but combined, Apple accounted for 41.4% of all online headphone sales in the U.S. during the last two weeks of December.;Second place;Bose;had 16.1% and third place;Sony Corp (ADR);(NYSE:;SNE;) managed to capture 4.2% of sales.;Perhaps an even bigger victory for Apple was over rival;Samsung;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;). Samsung actually beat Apple to the market with its IconX wireless, Bluetooth earbuds - with built-in fitness tracking and heart monitoring (features Apple's version lacks). According to Slice, since the release of the AirPods, Samsung's wireless headphone sales were just 0.5% of the market.;How Much Money Is There in Headphones?;Apple's big win in holiday headphone sales is a nice bit of positive news after a rather bumpy 2016, but does it actually mean anything? How big is the market for headphones?;It's actually bigger than you might think, and growing. A report by Global Market Insights put global headphone sales (wired, wireless, over-ear and earbuds) at $11.68 billion for 2015 with projections it would grow to;exceed $18 billion by 2023;. To put that in some perspective, global smartwatch sales for 2016 were;projected to hit $11.5 billion;, and that was before sales suddenly slumped mid-year.;The Haters Are Wrong: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock     Is Still Winning in 2017;AAPL clearly had an idea that headphones could prove to be a lucrative sideline when it shelled out;$3 billion in 2014 for Beats Electronics;- known primarily for its popular headphones.;The data from Slice covers U.S. online shopping only and for one month, when people are frantically searching for gifts. That being said, the early success of AirPods bodes well for AAPL in this market. And the popularity of wireless headphones in general helps to validate the company's decision to ditch the headphone jack in the iPhone 7.;Apple clearly isn't going to get rich from headphone sales, but as a sideline business it's doing quite well.

Not to worry since this uber-bullish trading environment offers many entry points for long trades in Amazon stock.;Source: Shutterstock;Recently, I wrote about;how to go long AMZN for free.;The trade was an easy win. Today I want to share another bullish Amazon stock trade only with slower time frames.;"makeArticleAd();";"This bests suits traders who don't want to watch the market's every tick. Although I don't believe in ""set-it-and-forget-it"" trades, today's trade comes close. It allows me to set a trade based on strong fundamentals and simply check in on my thesis periodically to see if it's still viable.";For decades, AMZN shorts have been wrong. I don't think 2017 will be the year they become right. Fundamentally, I'm optimistic for this ultimate startup company. It's winning on hundreds of fronts under awesome leadership.;This week, Amazon management announced its intention to create 100,000 new jobs in the U.S. That is roughly half of the current count. This is behavior of a company that has strong belief in its execution on big things to come.;10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print     Money;Technically, today won't be an obvious point of entry in Amazon stock and that's why I will build a healthy buffer from current levels.;Amazon Stock Options;The Trade:;Sell AMZN Jan 2018 $550 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $15 per contract. Selling naked puts is dangerous and should only be done if I am willing and able to own the shares at the strike sold. If Amazon stock falls below my strike I will be put the stock. I wouldn't accrue losses until Amazon stock falls below $535 per share. This trade has an 85% theoretical chance of success and a 30% buffer from current price.;It is important to note that these types of trades are not suitable for all stocks. I am comfortable doing them in quality names with current stories that are in full bloom.

So choosing risk levels becomes important. When I sell a naked put, I commit to owning the stock at that price.;I can mitigate that open-ended risk by modifying this trade to being a sold credit put spread instead. The Jan 2018 $560/$550 AMZN credit put spread would yield over 15% on money risked. The advantage here would be that my max risk would then be limited to the width of the spread less the premiums I collect.

Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. IBM;January 13, 2017, 09:36:00 AM EDT;Image source: Apple;In its famous 1984 commercial,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) portrayed;International Business Machines;(NYSE: IBM) as Big Brother. Once the fiercest of rivals, the two   companies are far more similar than different today. Beyond their   size and maturity, Apple and IBM shares have also been on a tear   over the past 12 months.;"makeArticleAd();";AAPL;data by;YCharts;Considering their many similarities, it's appropriate for   investors to wonder whose shares are the more attractive   potential buy today. To better answer this question, we'll put   Apple and IBM stocks through a three-part analysis to gain a   clearer sense of which one is the better buy now.;1. Financial fortitude;Let's cut to the chase here: Apple wins the contest of   financial fortitude by a landslide. It deserves noting, though,   that this is more due to Apple's historic profitability rather   than any financial imprudence on IBM's part.;Company;Cash and Investments;Debt;Cash From Operations;Current Ratio;Apple;$237.5 billion;$87.0 billion;$65.8 billion;1.3;IBM;$15.0 billion;$42.4 billion;$18.5 billion;1.2;Data sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor   relations, Yahoo! Finance.;Apple generates the bulk of its sales overseas, and its   practice of keeping its cash offshore has triggered several   not-so-small controversies in recent years. Apple held $216   billion of its cash overseas as of its most recent earnings   report. That means Apple can't directly tap into the majority of   its cash holdings without paying steep repatriation taxes.   Rather, Apple borrows against its overseas cash to fund its   capital return program.;Turning to IBM, Big Blue similarly has its financial house in   order. Though it has leveraged its balance sheet to a certain   extent, IBM generates plenty of cash flow to both service its   debts and reinvest in its business. However, Apple's overall   profitability simply can't be beat, making it the easy winner in   this portion of our analysis.;Winner: Apple.;2. Durable competitive advantages;Turning to their competitive moats, Apple and IBM each enjoy   some type of competitive advantage over their rivals. However,   for both companies, their competitive advantages might not be as   pronounced as they might initially seem.;Apple's platinum-grade brand, closed-loop operating system,   consistent device leadership, and immense financial resources   certainly all contribute to its ability to consistently generate   above-average returns on capital. Some of these items should   prove fairly straightforward. Apple's Fort Knox-esque cash   reserves allow it to buy its way into virtually any industry that   interests it. However, Apple's closed-loop software architecture   receives far less attention but is arguably more important in   terms of supporting Apple's competitive position.;In contrast to;Alphabet;'s Android or;Microsoft;'s Windows operating systems, Apple makes its software and app   ecosystem available on its devices. That means users who migrate   away from Apple's computers or mobile devices might not be able   to bring their content with them, although third-party services   such as Spotify have helped erode this situation in recent years.   It also bears noting that Apple's product-driven sales model also   presents something of a dormant risk. Should Apple somehow badly   misstep with one of its annual device designs, its sales could   suffer dramatically. Thanks to Apple's consistent device   leadership, though, this situation has never come to   fruition.;At IBM, the company's longtime relationships with customers   and the large percentage of its sales that come from its legacy;three-pronged business model;provide it with something of a competitive moat as well. However,   with the rise of the cloud-computing era and IBM's evolving place   in that space, the company's competitive stance has perhaps   weakened slightly. To cite one popular -- and important --   metric, IBM's sales have now declined for 18 consecutive   quarters. IBM's backlog of prearranged service bookings also fell   0.7% in constant currency terms in its most recent quarter,   although IBM still carries roughly 1.5 years' worth of revenue as   bookings.;Winner: tie.;3. Valuation;On the surface, Apple and IBM appear to be comparably valued.   In terms of their current P/E, forward P/E, and EV/EBITDA ratios,   there appears to be little difference between the two at first   glance.;Company;P/E Ratio;Forward P/E Ratio;EV/EBITDA;Apple;14.3;11.8;9.2;IBM;13.7;12.1;11.1;Data sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor   relations, Yahoo! Finance.;Pay extra attention to the EV/EBITDA ratio. It's arguably the   most useful valuation metric, because it takes into account each   company's equity, debt, and cash positions. This is particularly   important to consider when analyzing a cash-rich company like   Apple, which currently carries $12.73 in cash per share on its   balance sheet. Subtracting that cash amount out gives investors a   clearer sense of the value the market places on Apple's core   operations.;Apple and IBM are both cheap compared with the market as a   whole. In fact, after its recent rally, the;S&P 500;benchmark trades at a valuation of 26, nearly double that of   either Apple or IBM. This steep discount to the market reflects   the view that Apple and IBM will probably exhibit little to no   growth in the near term, which may not actually be the case.   Though their revenue growth outlook isn't particularly rosy --   Apple and IBM sales are expected to rise 6%  and fall 2%,   respectively, this year -- both companies are among the most   effective users of dividends and stock buybacks to drive   shareholder returns. In terms of the overall attractiveness of   their valuations, though, Apple wins this category as well.;Winner: Apple.;And the winner is... Apple;Apple's edge in two of the three categories examined here make   the iPhone maker the more attractive option today. However,   that isn't to say that IBM, especially in light of its own cheap   valuation, is not a buy. In fact, I like both Apple and IBM   shares as interesting potential buys at a time when cheap shares   of high-quality companies are becoming increasingly scarce.;So while Apple is the technical winner of this exercise,   investors looking for blue-chip technology stocks to buy would do   well to further investigate both Apple and IBM shares today.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for   over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

Volume rose to 774,000 contracts on Thursday, with   calls accounting for an above-average 68% of the day's take. AAPL   traders are already gearing up for the company's quarterly report   on Jan. 31, with 3 Feb series implieds pricing in a potential   post-earnings move of nearly 5% for the shares.

Will Apple-Hollywood Partner to Offer Original Content?;January 13, 2017, 09:08:00 AM EDT;Apple Inc;AAPL;is planning to collaborate with Hollywood for original television content as per a recent report from The Wall Street Journal. The iPhone-maker has long been rumored to develop original content on the lines of Netflix;NFLX;and Amazon;AMZN;Prime. However, nothing material has been revealed in the last 18 months.;"makeArticleAd();";Although Apple Music offers few documentaries on musicians they are nothing compared to serious programming available in Netflix or HBO. According to sources, Apple is currently engaged in discussions with veteran producers for buying rights to original scripts.;"According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple Music has already acquired the rights of a half-hour version of """;Carpool Karaoke;","" which is currently a segment on CBS's """;The Late Late Show with James Corden;"."" The company is also developing a semi-biographical television series on Beats co-founder and hip-hop legend Dr. Dre.

Instead, the company will focus on promoting its carefully selected content through Apple Music, which it hopes will give the comapny a competitive edge over Spotify.;Original Content to Boost Top-Line;Apple is currently searching for ways to boost its top-line growth, which declined in 2016 for the first time since 2001.

(Read More:;Apple Music Achieves 20 Million Paying Subscribers;).;Further, the company stated that sales from Apple Music surged 22% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

While Pandora said it would top its revenue forecast for the fiscal fourth quarter, it also said it would cut costs by laying off U.S. workers. Pandora stock was up 9% on Friday in response.;Source:;FrankieLeon via Flickr (Modified);Pandora said its advertising efforts had paid off, lifting sales over its previous forecast for between $362 million to $374 million.;"makeArticleAd();";Specifically, CEO Tim Westergren pointed out successes with in-app promotions, an aggressive approach to ad load and partnership activity with music labels and publishers.;Westergren said the company would be making;all of those areas an increased priority in 2017;.;The flip side to the announcement was the job cuts. Pandora plans on laying off 7% of its U.S. workforce (excluding;Ticketfly;, its recent $450 million acquisition) by fiscal Q1. Said Westergren:;"""The commitment to cost discipline will allow us to invest more heavily in product development and monetization and build on the foundations of our strategic investments.""";Pandora's announcement, out Thursday night, also boasted that the service's subscriber base has reached 4.3 million paid subscribers, which included a 375,000-net-subscriber addition to its Plus service. That's encouraging news for Pandora, which has had to contend with increasing competition from the likes of;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;),;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) and;Spotify;.;10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print     Money;Pandora stock is rebounding after a roughly monthlong lull that itself followed a huge surge in shares on reports of interest from;Sirius XM Holdings Inc.;(NASDAQ:;SIRI;). However, talks on that front have died down, leaving investors increasingly doubtful that a deal is imminent.;Pandora's surge today will have shares bouncing hard back above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, just a few days after P stock dipped below both lines of resistance.;As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;How Will Netflix, Inc.

The Personal Computer Market Plunged 5.7% in 2016;January 12, 2017, 07:16:00 PM EDT;"Market research company IDC announced on Jan. 11 that the   category of products that it refers to as ""traditional [personal   computers]"" dropped 1.5% year over year during the fourth quarter   of 2016 and by 5.7% over the course of the entirety of 2016.";Apple's new MacBook Pro computers could help the company   regain lost share in 2017. Image source: Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";"IDC said that the first quarter of 2016 was ""still constrained   by high inventory, free Windows 10 upgrades, and difficult   comparisons to commercial replacements in 2014 that were fueled   by the end of support for Windows XP.""";"That said, IDC says that beginning in mid-2016, the personal   computer market had ""moved beyond these inhibitors and seen   stabilizing commercial demand.""";"IDC also said that the ""contraction of the consumer [personal   computer] market has also slowed as growth and competition from   tablets and phones has eased up.""";"Analyst Neha Mahajan with IDC did say that the fourth-quarter   numbers ""might signal regained consumer confidence in the   [personal computer] market, with most of the sales being driven   by aggressive holiday promotions,"" cautioning that ""it needs to   be seen how much of the real demand is carried forward in the   coming quarters.""";This report certainly doesn't spell bad news for the personal   computer market -- a contracting rate of decline is certainly   preferable to a stable or accelerating rate of decline -- but it   does seem to reinforce the commonly held notion that the market   isn't likely to be a growth one going forward.;Vendor share shifts;Although the personal computer market is down overall, there   were some winners and losers among the major personal computer   vendors. IDC's press release included significant details of the   performances of the top five personal computer vendors by units   --;Lenovo;(NASDAQOTH: LNVGY) ,;HP Inc;(NYSE: HPQ) , Dell, ASUS, and;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) .;The report shows that Lenovo, the top vendor by units, saw   shipments drop 3%, outpacing the overall market, and growing its   market share to 21.3%, up from 20.8% in the prior year.;HP Inc, which has talked at length about its efforts to gain   share in the personal computer market (particularly in more   lucrative sub-segments like premium thin-and-light PCs, gaming,   and so on) managed to grow shipments by 1.3%, taking its share up   to 20.9% from 19.4%.;Privately held Dell enjoyed 4.3% growth, the fastest growing   of the bunch. Its market share moved up from 14.2% to 15.7%.;ASUS saw a modest 0.8% drop in unit shipments, which --   considering that the overall market dropped by 5.7% -- led to   share growth from 7% to 7.4%.;Apple -- which specializes in premium personal computers   running its macOS operating system -- suffered a 9.8%-unit   decline, taking its share down from 7.4% to just 7.1%.;And, finally, the rest of the market combined -- which added   up to about 72 million units -- suffered a drop in collective   market share from 31.2% to 27.7%.;In other words, the strong got stronger (save for Apple), and   the weak got weaker.;"What this ""consolidation"" means for market players";"IDC noted that there was ""accelerated market consolidation""   going on ""as the largest players moved to lock up supply.""";This consolidation might have some interesting long-term   consequences on the industry at large. Consolidation of power   among system vendors should give them additional leverage/buying   power with the major component vendors like microprocessor   specialist;Intel;(NASDAQ: INTC) , which supplies most of the central processing   units (CPUs) that go into personal computers today.;Intel's new seventh-generation Core processors were recently   launched to allow computer vendors to refresh their systems.   Image source: Intel.;The bigger the volumes any personal computer vendor commands,   the steeper the volume discounts those vendors can demand from   their suppliers. Such a dynamic may lead to decreased margins for   the suppliers and increased margins for the system vendors (due   to lower component costs).;Consolidation may also mean that the winners should enjoy   improved profitability as competitive pressures ease (potentially   driving gross profit margins up) and the revenue shares of said   winners improve (perhaps driving operating leverage).;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The 3 Biggest Challenges Facing Apple;January 12, 2017, 06:22:00 PM EDT;Shares of;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) have gone essentially nowhere over the past two   years or so, despite incredible profits, a fast-growing dividend,   and over $130 billion worth of share repurchases to date. The   iPhone, which accounts for the bulk of Apple's revenue and   profits, has suffered from slumping sales for multiple quarters,   with the launch of the iPhone 7 unable to reverse that trend.   Sales of iPads and Macs also tumbled during Apple's third   quarter, leading to a 9% year-over-year decline in total   revenue.;Apple will attempt to return to growth in 2017 and beyond, but   the company faces some major challenges on that front.;"makeArticleAd();";Image source: Apple.;The smartphone market has become the PC market;Consumers stopped getting excited about new laptops years ago,   and that same phenomenon is now happening in the smartphone   market. Smartphones are still improving each year, but the   relative change is getting smaller. Just like how each new   generation of PC is only modestly better than the last,   smartphones launched today are no longer dramatically better than   those launched a year ago.;The iPhone 7, while one of the best smartphones available,   offered little in the way of compelling new features. A faster   processor, better graphics, and an improved camera have become   table stakes in the smartphone business, and features like water   resistance are far from revolutionary. The iPhone 7 was another   refinement to Apple's successful iPhone formula, but refinements   aren't moving units like they used to.;"There's hope that the next iPhone will bring with it   substantial improvements, including an OLED screen and a dramatic   new design. Analysts are talking about an iPhone ""super cycle,""   which could spur a massive number of upgrades and return Apple to   growth. But that requires Apple to come up with something   genuinely new and exciting, something that it's had trouble with   as the iPhone has matured. Is there any innovation left in   smartphones? I guess we'll find out later this year.";Coming up with the next big thing is hard;"Apple changed the world, first with the iPod and then in a   bigger way with the iPhone. Other products have been successful   in an absolute sense; Apple sold more than 9 million iPads during   the fourth quarter alone. But relative to the iPhone, the iPad   isn't very meaningful for the company, producing just 9% of total   revenue.";"The Apple Watch, while still in its early days, also hasn't   set the world on fire. Apple still lumps its wearable device in   the ""Other Products"" category, which saw revenue slump 22% year   over year during the fourth quarter to just $2.4 billion. While   the iPhone became a must-have device that essentially created the   smartphone market, the Apple Watch doesn't have the same   shine.";Image source: Apple.;The odds of Apple coming up with another device on par with   the iPhone are vanishingly small, for the simple reason that the   iPhone has been such a massive outlier in the consumer   electronics industry. Apple is reportedly still interested in   self-driving cars, and rumors have been swirling about the   company working on a virtual reality or augmented reality device.   But Apple is playing catch-up in all of these areas. If iPhone   sales continue to slump, it will be very difficult to offset that   decline with sales of new devices.;Services are no panacea;Apple has made a big deal about its growing services   businesses, but it's nowhere near big enough to counteract iPhone   weakness. Services generated $6.3 billion of revenue during the   fourth quarter, up 24% year over year. Again, in an absolute   sense, the services business is impressive. But relative to the   iPhone, it's peanuts.;There are a lot of questions surrounding Apple's services   business. With iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales all declining, can the   company keep up its services growth rate if it's selling fewer   devices? Will Apple's push into content, first with Apple Music   and now, reportedly, with original TV shows and movies, be   anywhere near as profitable as selling hardware? Getting into   original content is going to be expensive, and while Apple   certainly has deep pockets, I don't see a clear competitive   advantage for the company.;The major challenge for Apple will be replacing high-margin   hardware revenue with enough services revenue to prevent further   declines in profitability. That's not impossible, but it's a tall   order.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Why Apple Is No Threat to Netflix;January 12, 2017, 05:09:00 PM EDT;Image source: Netflix.;It seems as if the booming realm of premium streaming video   services is about to get more competitive.;The Wall Street Journal;is;reporting;that;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL)  is in the process of building out a new   business of original TV shows and movies.;"makeArticleAd();";The popular initial reaction is that;Netflix;(NASDAQ: NFLX) is going to be in for a world of hurt. Apple is a   beloved brand, and a company with far more financial resources   than its fellow Californian enterprise. However, reports of   Netflix's demise or even that it should be fearing Apple's push   into original content are overblown.;Netflix will be just fine. Let's go over a few of the reasons   why Apple's arrival is no big deal.;1. Apple isn't gunning for Netflix;The Wall Street Journal;'s sources are saying that Apple's push for video is more about   beefing up Apple Music, the $10-a-month music-streaming platform   that it rolled out two years ago. Apple Music is growing nicely,   but no match for the similarly priced Spotify that continues to   be the market leader.;Giving Apple Music subscribers access to exclusive video   content would help Apple differentiate itself from Spotify, which   at 40 million premium accounts is twice as big as Apple Music.   Spotify also has more than 100 million total users, a figure that   Apple Music doesn't compete with because it's only available to   paying subscribers.;In short, Apple's push into first-run eye candy is more about   turning Apple Music into a digital smorgasbord along the lines of   the goodies that;Amazon.com;(NASDAQ: AMZN) provides Prime members at no additional cost than   it is to become a stand-alone Netflix killer. One can rightfully   argue that a lack of intent doesn't preclude Netflix from being   in the line of fire anyway, but there are other reasons why   Netflix won't wind up being collateral damage here.;2. Netflix survived Amazon;If Apple's digital music and subscription offering is going to   look a lot like Amazon Prime, then we may as well belly up to the   bar of the original alleged Netflix killer: Amazon. Jeff Bezos   introduced streaming video to Amazon Prime;six years ago;.;We don't have official Prime Video usage metrics. We know   critics generally like the originals, but there's a good chance   that you and your friends have seen more;House of Cards;or;Stranger Things;than;Mozart in the Jungle;or;Transparent;.;However, even if Amazon's Prime Video was a hit, the ultimate   burden to fail or succeed falls on Netflix. It had 21.7 million   domestic subscribers and just 1.9 million international accounts   when Prime Video was launched. Netflix has 86.7 million total   subscribers -- 47.5 million domestic and 39.3 million   international -- today. Amazon is a worthy peer to Netflix, but   clearly it has not been an impediment to a platform that has   nearly quadrupled in popularity since its arrival.;3. Apple isn't as crazy as Amazon;Amazon was a scary entrant in 2011 because Bezos isn't afraid   to operate at a loss for the sake of market share. That's not how   Apple plays the game.;One can say that Apple views some of its services as a way to   sell hardware, but Apple Music recently became available on   Android devices. This may make Apple's video push scary since it   can cover a wider market than servicing just folks tethered to   iOS, but it also means that Apple isn't going to take a hit to   fuel the entertainment on Android smartphones.;Netflix has a juicy market that likely topped 90 million   dedicated subscribers last month. Unlike Amazon and apparently   Apple, which will try to squeeze proprietary TV shows and movies,   Netflix throws all of its resources into video content, with   $14.4 billion in streaming content obligations as of the end of   September. If a ruthless Amazon couldn't dethrone Netflix, it's   hard to picture a more level-headed Apple doing so.;Netflix will be just fine.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple, Inc. Barely Grew Mac Market Share Last Quarter;January 12, 2017, 02:52:00 PM EDT;The new MacBook Pro appears to have only slightly helped   Apple's Mac unit shipments. Image source: Apple.;The iPhone wasn't the only;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) product to stall in 2016. The Mac has certainly   seen better days, too, and the Mac maker lost global PC market   share throughout much of 2016. Well, market researcher IDC has   just released its latest estimates on the global PC market for   the fourth quarter, and there's a little bit of good news for   Apple investors. According to the estimates, Apple might have   barely notched a gain in its global PC market share.;"makeArticleAd();";A total of 70.2 million PCs were shipped in the fourth   quarter, representing a year-over-year decline of 1.5%. Apple   shipped roughly 5.3 million Macs by IDC's count, which represents   a decline of just 0.9%. That's technically enough to earn Apple a   tiny bit more market share, performing slightly better than the   broader market.;Breaking the trend;According to IDC's quarterly estimates, Apple underperformed   the PC market in Q2 and Q3, so outperforming the PC market in Q4,   however slight, still breaks the negative trend.;Quarter;Apple Change (YOY);Worldwide PC Market Change (YOY);Q1 2016;(2.1%);(11.5%);Q2 2016;(8.3%);(4.5%);Q3 2016;(13%);(3.9%);Q4 2016;(0.9%);(1.5%);Data source: IDC.;However, it's worth noting that IDC's estimates don't always   line up with the actual volumes that Apple reports. In fact,   Apple's official figures are;worse;than IDC's for the first three quarters of 2016 (Q4 results will   be released later this month). The company saw Mac units fall by   11.6% in the first quarter, so Apple actually lost share for the   first three quarters of the year.;This marks the fifth consecutive year that the global PC   market has contracted. For the full year, there were an estimated   260.2 million PCs shipped worldwide, down 5.7% from 2015. Rivals   like;HP;and Dell fared well, growing by 1.3% and 4.3% respectively.;Back to the Mac;Apple has seemingly recovered slightly in the fourth quarter,   which is also when it launched its controversial new MacBook Pro.   On one hand, the new notebook suffered from supply constraints   throughout most of the quarter. Many customers that placed orders   early still didn't receive their products until December. It's   challenging to fully gauge demand when suffering from supply   constraints.;"More broadly, Apple has received some deserved criticism over   its continued neglect of the Mac, despite recent comments from   CEO Tim Cook that Apple is ""very committed"" to the Mac and that   ""great desktops"" are in the pipeline. Even Apple's former ad man   Ken Segall is";boggled;by what is taking the company so long to update its lineup.;For the longest time, Apple disregarded traditional resource   allocation methodologies, simply focusing on building great   products and trusting that the financials will take care of   themselves. But it seems that under Cook the company may be   implementing traditional resource allocation methodologies, where   the most important products (iOS devices) get the most attention.   It doesn't matter if this is a conscious decision or an   inadvertent one -- Mac development is clearly;suffering;. As long as the Mac remains second-class relative to the iPhone,   investors can continue to expect market share losses.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

Tech Stock Roundup: AR/VR and Self Driving Cars Dominate CES;January 12, 2017, 02:13:00 PM EDT;Top news last week was the Consumer Electronics Show, which started on Thursday and ended Sunday. There were a couple of days of media events before that though. As most of us were expecting, the show was dominated by virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and self driving cars, two areas where new technology was showcased and important collaborations announced. Some other developments involved Amazon's;AMZN;Alexa, 5G technology from Intel;INTC;and Qualcomm;QCOM;and robots from Panasonic and Honda.;In VR/AR, there were announcements from Intel, Alphabet's;GOOGL;Google and privately-held ODG.;Intel sought to instill faith in VR tech, by showcasing VR experiences in the form of attendance at a sporting event, experiencing live surround video from a drone, jumping out of a helicopter in a wingsuit and exploring a waterfall. It also showcased a VR zombie apocalypse video game.;Osterhout Design Group, or ODG unveiled the latest in its line of sleek new smartglass series. The AR glasses called the R8 (for consumers) and R9 (for corporate users) are based on the first Qualcomm 10nm chip called Snapdragon 835. Both glasses have narrower angles of vision than Microsoft's Hololens but are significantly cheaper.;Google, which has tried to popularize VR technology through its Cardboard platform, launched a VR headset called Daydream View last year. At CES 2017, its hardware partner Huawei announced that two of its phones will work with Daydream and that it is also looking to make its phones compatible with Google's AR software platform called Project Tango.;Long-time hardware partner Asustek said that its ZenFone AR was already compatible with both. Still, this is a short list and without a broader list of hardware, the technology is unlikely to take off. But this kind of popularity simply won't happen until there is more content and more apps, so it could take a while.;As far as self-driving cars are concerned, automakers are working on apps of their own. Ford and Toyota for instance have announced that mid-sized automakers like Mazda Motor, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki Motor Corp have joined their SmartDeviceLink Consortium, which aims to develop an open-source software alternative to Apple's;AAPL;Car Play and Google's Android Auto.;BMW, Intel and Mobileye will test their co-developed self driving car technology in 40 self driving cars by the second half of 2017. Intel also launched Intel Go, which is a package of processors that can range from a basic Atom to the highest end Xeon along with other components and software.;Google partnered with Fiat Chrysler to create an Android-based in-car infotainment system.;Further details on Microsoft;MSFT;and NVIDIA's;NVDA;self-driving efforts follow:;Company;Last  Week;Last 6 Months;AAPL;+1.19%;+22.70%;FB;+6.07%;+5.75%;GOOGL;+2.77%;+13.41%;MSFT;-0.10%;+19.51%;INTC;-0.49%;+6.75%;CSCO;-0.76%;+2.92%;AMZN;+4.03%;+5.29%;Other stories -;Corporate;Apple In South Korea;: Apple has confirmed that it is getting ready to open its first retail store in a southern district of South Korea. While the exact location wasn't mentioned, it did say that the space was under construction and that it was looking to hire people. Speculation is rife that Apple will choose a spot in Gangnam where Samsung has its flagship store. Or it could also go for another spot in the neighbourhood, on the fashionable Garosu-gil shopping street.;Apple Removes NYT Apps In China;": Apple has taken down the Times' English and Chinese language apps in China because of its violations with government regulations. Times spokesperson Eileen Murphy said it was ""a deeply regrettable decision"" and asked Apple to reconsider. Apple has said that this could happen when ""the situation changes."" Apple has been doing all it can to please the Chinese government given that China remains an important market for the company. CEO Tim Cook made wtwo visits to the country in May and October last year and promised a second Chinese R&D center as a result of those visits.";Apple Confirms Softbank Investment;: Apple confirmed the investment as did Softbank, according to Benjamin Spicehandler, an outside PR representative for SoftBank. He also said that Foxconn, Oracle founder Larry Ellison's family office and chipmaker Qualcomm said that they intended to invest. Despite the hype, Softbank is putting in only $25 billion with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund putting in $45 billion, thus giving it effective control.;pple In India;: Apple supplier Wistron has reportedly applied for permission to expand its Bengaluru plant. It's expected that this will enable Apple to satisfy the Indian government's requirement that Apple source 30% of components from within the country if it wishes to have its own stores there. Earlier, Apple promised to open an R&D center.;But Apple also wants tax breaks, which is something the Indian government is unlikely to agree to. India is growing into one of the largest smartphone markets in the world although its 10% share of total consumption still trails China 30% by a mile. But China growth is slowing down while India growth is picking up. Moreover, India is less protectionist, which could help Apple longer term.;Google Targeting Indian SMBs;": Google intends to play a role in getting Indian SMBs online. The company estimates that nearly three-quarters of the country's small businesses currently don't have an online presence. It intends to launch a new tool that will allow them to build their mobile-friendly websites free of charge. The product will roll out in India first and then to the rest of the world. India-born CEO Sundar Pichai has said that ""India shapes how we develop products in so many ways, big and small"".";Alibaba Promises U.S. Jobs;: Alibaba's Jack Ma has promised President-elect Trump that Alibaba would get a million American small business owners onto its Tmall platform over the next five years. This is expected to result in the employment of at least a million people at these organizations to take care of the systems side of things. Of course this doesn't guarantee jobs because U.S. manufacturing costs are not competitive and Alibaba has its fair share of counterfeits that are usually more cost-effective than the originals. So for SMBs to succeed on the platform, they need to first figure out how they're going to differentiate themselves.;Legal/Regulatory;Google Could Lose Government Business;: The Labor Department filed a lawsuit with the Office of Administrative Law Judges asking that Google be forced to supply employee-related information that Google says is confidential. The department says that the evaluation is conducted to ensure contractors do not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. So if Google doesn't comply with the requirements like every other government contractor, all its government contracts should be terminated.;Technology/Products;iPhone 7 Production Cut;: Apple has reportedly cut back first quarter 2017 iPhone shipments by as much as 10%. This is according to Japanese daily Nikkei based on changes in supply chain orders and analyst reports. Apple is expected to have three new models next year, so it probably makes sense to get inventories down beforehand. Particularly since iPhone growth rates have dropped off the last few years as it's gotten harder to add features that would get people to upgrade.;IBM Innovation Goals;": IBM has announced its innovation goals over the next five years. Dubbed the IBM 5 in 5, the program focuses on the use of technology to increase our knowledge about various things. Using AI for example, the human brain can be better understood, helping detect, prevent, treat/cure diseases such as depression, psychosis, bipolar disease, mania or schizophrenia. Hyper imaging technology will be used to impart ""super hero vision"" to portable, affordable and accessible devices that can be embedded on our phones or self driving cars.";Using data picked up by IoT devices, all the information about the earth will be aggregated, organized and analyzed to help people (like farmers) get their jobs done more effectively. Its silicon photonics technology (that transfers data by light) will be embedded in IoT devices. The devices will operate as a cloud-connected network around natural gas extraction sites so methane leaks can be detected immediately, thus helping to control global warming.;NVIDIA Shield TV;: At CES, NVIDIA launched the SHIELD TV, a one-of-its-kind experience combining the goodness of 4K HDR video with Amazon Video, Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies and VUDU as well as a huge library of games featuring thousands of titles with more being added every day. And that isn't all: the Android TV powered device brings AI to entertainment by allowing you to send voice commands, also turning the TV to a smart home hub and connecting with a host of home devices (although you'll need the special mike if you want to use these AI features).;M&A and Collaborations;Intel Buys 15% Stake In HERE Maps;: Intel has bought a 15% stake in HERE International from current indirect shareholders Audi, BMW and Daimler thus strengthening its commitment to self driving car technology. Intel and HERE will collaborate on R&D to develop a mapping architecture that will update high definition maps in real time. They will also work on IoT and machine learning. Intel will also nominate one person to HERE's Supervisory Board of Directors after the transaction closes this quarter.;Cisco-Ericsson Strengthen Partnership;: Cisco and Ericsson are adding a Wifi solution called Evolved Wi-Fi Networks (EWN) to their combined product line. The more complete wireless solutions will enable Ericsson to go after bigger customers such as the very large shopping malls. The transaction also helps Cisco expand its reach in a market that is increasingly moving away from specialized hardware by making software more powerful.;Microsoft Deal With Renault-Nissan;: Microsoft, which aims to strengthen its position as a self driving car platform, is now in a relationship with Nissan that will do just that. Nissan is planning more than 10 self-driving car models by 2020 and Microsoft's Connected Vehicle Platform is likely to get into at least some if not all of them by virtue of its strength in the Azure cloud service, Office productivity suite and Cortana. Renault-Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn said that Microsoft's global reach, its familiarity with compliance issues automakers face and its plans for making the relationship more valuable over time helped him choose Microsoft.;Alibaba Ties With Maersk;: This agreement lets business users book a place on Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk's containers through Alibaba's OneTouch platform. It seeks to eliminate freight and forwarding middlemen, digitize the transaction and speed up the process for businessmen. For Alibaba, it's yet another indication of the company's growing interest in logistics (it already owns 47% of Cainiao which accounts for 70% of all shipments within China, a minority stake in Shanghai based YTO, which also takes care of a huge amount of merchandise). OneTouch is part of Alibaba's business-to-business division and has reportedly serviced 20K merchants to date.;NVIDIA Partners With Audi, Here;: NVIDIA's deal with HERE involves incorporating the NVIDIA MapWorks AI technology into its HERE HD Live Map, which can then be used in NVIDIA Driveworks Software to put localization into cars. They will also, in the future, collaborate on the development of an in-vehicle solution to pick up environmental factors that will then be transmitted to the cloud to update the map there. Its relationship with Audi is now being expanded to collaborate on a level 4 driving system that will enable Audi to deliver a self-driving car by 2020. It is also partnering with auto parts suppliers, Bosch and ZF to commercialize its DRIVE PX 2 autonomous driving computer. In Japan, NVIDIA is partnering with the leading mapping company ZENRIN for another cloud-to-car solution.;Some Numbers;Apple App Store Numbers;: Apple has announced that its App Store paid out $20 billion to app developers in 2016, a 40% increase from 2015. The company normally takes a 30% cut of revenue but last year, reduced the commission to 15% for those offering their apps on a subscription basis. This made it more lucrative for service providers like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Pandora, etc. As more providers move to the SaaS model, this will remain a hot business for Apple. Its biggest day of App Store sales ever was Jan 1, 2017, when customer spending jumped to $240 million. The top markets of the U.S, U.K., Japan and China were up 90% year over year setting the tone for a very strong 2017.;Nielsen App Ranks;: Nielsen's report on the most popular smartphone apps says that the Facebook app tops in average unique monthly users, followed by Facebook Messenger (not surprising since Facebook users were forced to use it). After that come Google's YouTube, Maps, Search, Play and Gmail in that order. Rounding out the top ten are Facebook's Instagram, Apple Music and Amazon.;Zacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term   Profit;Today you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

How Apple's AR Glasses Can Avoid Making The Same Mistakes As Google Glass;January 12, 2017, 01:38:30 PM EDT;Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20. And it may just work in Apple’s (;AAPL;) favor.;From criticism such as poor design or what some perceived to be the product’s ability to infringe on personal space, there were tons of reasons why Alphabet’s (;GOOGL;) Google Glass failed. Even advocates of the product couldn’t decide whether Glass should be used as a fashionable device all the time or just for specific practical functions.;Apparently, none of these reasons matter to Apple, which is rumored to be interested in its own glass product. And given Apple’s often unspoken strategy of not needing to be first to market, but perfecting the market, Apple — according to multiple reports — may be intent on using Google's failure to its advantage.;"makeArticleAd();";Rumors now suggest augmented reality is Apple’s next big thing — a pair of augmented reality glasses, to be specific. Apple blog site;9to5Mac on Tuesday;"said the Cupertino-based iPhone maker is working with with optical company Carl Zeiss to create the glasses, which has been described as a “light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses.""";Exactly when these glasses will be released is unknown, though several reports suggest they could be launched as early as this year or in 2018. Of course, Apple hasn’t commented on this latest rumor. An email to company requesting more details was not immediately returned. And I’m not expecting one.;However, in a;recent post;on Facebook (;FB;") tech evangelist Robert Scoble noted that Zeiss employee confirmed rumors that both companies ""are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.”";“AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Tim Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.”;In an interview with;ABC news last September;, Cook — though he stopped short of divulging specific plans — made it clear that augmented reality was his preferred route over virtual reality.;Given Cook’s apparent interest in AR, partnering with Zeiss makes perfect sense. According to;tech site Engadget;", Zeiss’ strategy for the product is ""to develop these curved lenses and then partner with a technology company that can develop the computing hardware and software.” Given Apple’s ecosystem strengths and its ability to control both the hardware and software, it would be the ideal partner for Zeiss.";In short, while Google Glass, announced in 2012, was likely too advanced for its time, Apple’s AR ambitions seems well timed. That, however, doesn’t guarantee its AR glasses — whatever they will be called — will be a hit. But to the extent Apple can sell the reality of the product and not just seek to capitalize on the hype, it would have already succeeded where Google failed.
3 Things You Should Really Know About the Internet of Things;January 12, 2017, 01:33:00 PM EDT;Image source: Getty Images.;"It's easy to be skeptical about new tech trends. Every   emerging technology is seemingly touted as the ""next big thing,""   which leaves consumers and investors to wonder which new thing is   truly the next big thing, and what's just hype.";So I understand why there's some skepticism among investors   about the Internet of Things (even though I think it could be;one of the best years to invest in this   market;). But if you doubt that the IoT has staying power, or worry   that it can't live up to the hype, or that it's just a fad, let   me challenge that thinking by explaining what the IoT is, and   more importantly, what it is;isn't;.;"makeArticleAd();";The IoT is a technological shift, not a trend;The Internet of Things is a different way of creating   communication between devices, computers, and industrial   equipment, allowing us to collect data from the things around us   and interact with them in a way we never have before.;That's a pretty bold statement, so let me give an example.;General Electric;(NYSE: GE) uses sensors and analytics software in jet engines so   that the equipment can communicate about how an engine is being   used, and even predict when it needs to be serviced,;before;it actually breaks.;GE's sensors and software have determined that airplane   engines in the Middle East and China are sometimes less efficient   because they get dirtier faster. Based on that, the company   recommended a simple solution of washing the engines more often   to minimize the need for repairs. The result of using the engine   analytics to fix that simple problem will save GE's engine   customers about $7 million annually by reducing jet fuel   consumption and increasing engine lifespans.;Tech trends are just preferences that device makers or   consumers have (like wanting a bigger smartphone screen instead   of a smaller one). But technological shifts like the IoT change   how companies do business.;It's primarily about the enterprise market, not     consumer devices;With the arrival of smart home hubs like;Amazon.com;'s Echo and Google Home, and wearable devices like the;Apple;Watch, it's easy to understand why some people think that the IoT   is mostly about consumer products. But in reality, the enterprise   market is fueling the IoT's growth.;According to BI Intelligence, enterprise devices will account   for 40% of all 23.3 billion IoT devices by 2019. And the   enterprise market will be the largest of all the IoT segments,   followed by home (consumer market) and government.;Verizon Communications;(NYSE: VZ) is a good example. While gadgets will certainly spur   IoT growth, Verizon is selling new network services to businesses   and governments that want to bring new IoT systems online. Smart   cities will have smog sensors and street lights than need   cellular connectivity, while fleet companies will need network   connections for the IOT devices that track shipments and   vehicles.;Verizon is already offering IoT services, and last quarter   its IoT revenue grew by 24% to $217 million. That's a small   percentage of its overall revenue, but as the number of connected   IoT devices grows so will Verizon's IoT revenue.;The IoT isn't coming, it's already here;Two facts that I often cite about the IoT is that it'll be   worth $7.1 trillion annually by 2020 and that there will be about   50 billion IoT devices by that same year. But while we're only   three years away from those predictions, their scope can seem   intangible.;So here are few examples proving that the IoT isn't some hazy   opportunity, but rather a concrete market that companies are   already building:;Deere & Company;(NYSE: DE) is a leader in agricultural precision planting,   because it builds IoT-related technologies into its farming   equipment, or offers than as add-ons for older models. Some of   the company's tractors are equipped with sensors and wireless   communication (both Wi-Fi and cellular) and can track where seeds   are planted, how far apart they're placed, and even measure the   amount of pressure that was used to put them in the ground -- all   through an iPad app.;Deere also allows farmers to store field data in its cloud   service, and keep track of how well their equipment is performing   as well. The company even offers some self-driving capabilities   in some of its tractors that use the software and sensors to   deliver precise seed planting. Remember, this isn't a   hypothetical IoT use case -- these sensors, connections, and   analytics software are already being used in the agricultural   industry.;Then there's the automotive industry. Connected cars are   already a part of the IoT, and;Qualcomm;(NASDAQ: QCOM) is leading the pack. Its cellular chips allow cars   to receive over-the-air updates, gather telematics data that can   be analyzed by dealers and owners, and allow the vehicles to   communicate with other vehicles (called V2V) and the   infrastructure around them (V2I).;Qualcomm;bolstered its position;in the connected car market recently when it purchased;NXP Semiconductors;(NASDAQ: NXPI) for $39 billion. NXP is one of the leading   automotive semiconductor makers and is developing its own   off-the-shelf semi-autonomous driving software. With this   technology, Qualcomm could become a leader in the connected-car   space by supplying both the connectivity chips and some of the   software for semi-autonomous vehicles.;Of course, the IoT isn't just impacting the agricultural and   automotive sectors. The industrial, healthcare, and energy   industries (and many others) are already seeing benefits as   well.;The point of all this is that the IoT isn't just a hype term   for new technologies, and it's not a hypothetical situation.   Companies from across all major sectors are implementing IoT tech   in order to improve their businesses and create new services that   didn't exist before. These companies are already firm believers   in the IoT -- and their investors should be too.;10 stocks we like better than Verizon     Communications;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Verizon Communications     wasn't one of them!

It’s Not Too Late to Take a Bite out of Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock;January 12, 2017, 11:40:36 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Up until recently, mega-tech had been a bunch of sleeping giants but no longer. After lagging for a while, the;PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1;(ETF);(NASDAQ:;QQQ;) plowed into record territory this week. Strength came from the likes of;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;),;Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;). Others such as;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) and;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;,NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) are also working on bullish setups.;Source: Apple;The earnings season will undoubtedly make or break these set ups. An easy way to bet long this upside potential is with a blanket long position on the QQQ. But today I want to focus on AAPL based on a specific thesis - the;Samsung;(OTCMKTS:;SSNLF;) effect.;"makeArticleAd();";Yes, I know it's been overly exposed. But I will share my personal experience to illustrate my thoughts.;For years, my household has sided with Samsung phones. Until we recently had a phone literally catch fire. In our efforts to fix the phone (and while dealing with the thousand hoops that were imposed upon us) we ended up switching phones makers and providers.;The point of the story is this: One out of the three new phones ended up being an iPhone 7. This wasn't because we were shopping for it, but rather that it was suggested by the salesperson and offered free by the provider. Conclusion: AAPL will gain incremental business from Samsung regardless of who is shopping for what. It's what they call;"""pin action.""";10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second     Wind;Fundamentally, I reiterate my statement that the AAPL machine will continue to offer an attractive stock value. But I have very little faith that Tim Cook is the right leader for it. What I do see attractive here is the technical upside potential. AAPL stock has the potential to retest the highs. The set up is available for the bulls.;The Trade:;Buy AAPL Mar $120/$125 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.80 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. If Apple stock rallies past my spread, I stand to double my money. Options are time sensitive, so the March contract allows 65 days to be proven right.;In this case, I want to hedge my bets by selling downside risk against AAPL value to lower my upside entry cost. I don't do this, however, unless I believe in the value of AAPL stock against which I am selling risk.;The Bank:;Sell AAPL Jan 2018 $90 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract. Selling naked puts is dangerous and I only do it if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. If AAPL stock falls over 25% I could be assigned the stock. In which case, $87 per share would be my breakeven price. Anything lower would accrue losses.;Since AAPL earnings are not due for two weeks, I will likely delay selling the puts just in case they decide to correct a little.;It is important to note that the short-term reactions to earnings is a binary event. Meaning it's more gambling than investing. The quality of the report doesn't matter as much as it should. Wall Street is unpredictable with its reactions.;The Haters Are Wrong: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock     Is Still Winning in 2017;Furthermore, markets in general are at all-time-high levels. So if Trump doesn't deliver on much of his promises, we could see a market-wide correction. As long as my downside put level is not breached, any revenues captured from selling the long bet would be pure profits.;I am not required to hold trade into their expiration dates.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Ugly as Sin, But Has a Chance for Redemption;January 12, 2017, 11:14:59 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;If there's a candidate for biggest disappointment of 2016,;Fitbit Inc;(NYSE:;FIT;) would be more than a reasonable choice. After starting last year near the $30 mark, FIT stock endured a remarkably bad run that was briefly interrupted by bursts of positive momentum. It was at that point where I figured the selloff was overdone. Fitbit stock, after all, represented the chic wave of wearable technology.;Source:;Via Fitbit;Boy, was I ever wrong!;"makeArticleAd();";After those bursts came a worrisome lull - and then the hammer. On Nov. 2, FIT stock released its third quarter of fiscal year 2016 results. Although earnings for FIT matche;d consensus estimates,;Wall Street was unhappy with the increasingly negative trend. Prior to Q3, the earnings surprise for Fitbit stock was over 123%. In Q2, it was only 10% above consensus. Achieving parity was therefore no achievement at all.;Wall Street is a town that, of course, takes no prisoners and shows no mercy. FIT stock was summarily executed the following day, hemorrhaging 34% in the markets. The good times, it appeared, were over and never to be seen again.;Dim Outlook for FIT stock;There are a number of reasons why investors abandoned ship on Fitbit stock. On the financial front, the hard numbers did not harmonize with the company's glitzy sales pitch.;7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead     Weight Right Now;For instance, revenue growth has always been the main attraction for FIT stock. Obviously, no one buys it for its dividends. But in recent quarters, that growth slid to all-new lows as a publicly traded company. That raises concerns about whether or not FIT products are simply a fad.;The slowdown in net income is also a red flag for investors. Fitbit stock is unfortunately saddled with an ongoing liability. In order to maintain excitement in the fickle health and fitness industry, it has to pump out multiple advertisements and promotions. Inevitably, that drags on the bottom line, making FIT stock overvalued on paper. Combined with declining sales growth, prospects suddenly dimmed.;But as;InvestorPlace;contributors Lawrence Meyers and James Brumley wryly note, the biggest risk to Fitbit stock is the consumer. I love what;Meyers has to say;", so I'll just let him say it: ""Many try to lose weight via diets. Most diets fail. Many people will buy a Fitbit product as part of a diet and exercise regiment, and will lose motivation. Because diets fail, FIT stock will fail … as an investment.""";As if that wasn't enough of a gut punch, here's what;Brumley remarked;": ""Although smartwatches and wrist-worn fitness trackers launched with a great deal of fervor, that interest faded quickly. Once 'the' consumer-tech item to buy, smartwatches only appear at the top of 3% of this year's holiday gift wish-lists.";"As Jim Cramer put it a couple of weeks ago, 'I think that everybody who wants a Fitbit has one.'"" Brumley adds that competitors like";Garmin Ltd;. (NASDAQ:;GRMN;) offer cheaper alternatives.;Don't Ignore the Upside Potential for Fitbit Stock;Truer words have never been said. At the same time, I think my fellow colleagues and the army of FIT critics are a bit misguided. We're Americans and we're fat - I totally get that. Every time;Macy's Inc;(NYSE:;M;) runs a sale, I lament the fact that the only options remaining are going to be sizes well outside the middle of the bell curve.;Click to Enlarge;But let's consider this - despite our inability to keep dietary resolutions, we somehow see fitness centers sprout like wildfire. This isn't just an anecdotal story. According to data provided by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the producer price index of;fitness center memberships;has risen 2.7% in 2016 from the lows of 2009. That signals two things - interest in fitness, and demand (ie. people opening their wallets) for fitness products and services.;"Should President-elect Donald Trump ""make America great again,"" we will see the PPI increase not only in fitness, but in a slew of consumer sectors. When the money is flowing, people will spend, and largely on themselves. It's just human nature - we want to look good and feel good, and exercise is an effective route to get there.";So I'm not too concerned about the relevance of FIT stock. Just because someone wants to eat Doritos all day doesn't mean others share the same sentiment.;The FIT Hasn't Hit the Fan Yet;"It's not the most appreciated attribute, since Wall Street can be an impatient bunch. However, I think we have to give credit where credit is due. Chief Executive James Park is the first to recognize the vulnerabilities of Fitbit stock and is doing something about it. In November, I argued that he ""is";transitioning the company;"into a 'digital health company.' It's an organic move that doesn't conflict with its core Surge products, but makes FIT stock less vulnerable to consumer whims.""";Yes, tech giants like;Apple Inc;. (NASDAQ:;AAPL;) are an organic source of competition due to the fact that their offerings can do the things that a FIT device does and so much more. But to Park, Apple is also an inspiration. In an interview with;MarketWatch;, the CEO discussed launching a social;networking platform;for FIT. Through aggregated tips, likes and feedback, users are encouraged to meet their fitness goals. Think;Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;) but with actual utility.;Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock on     Any Dip;The ultimate point is this - people are criticizing FIT stock for being one-dimensional, yet the company is clearly branching out. The problem obviously is that the price of Fitbit stock assumes that this is as good as it gets. I agree that shares are volatile and will be risky in the nearer-term.;But fundamentally, I still see the potential. Despite our expanding waistlines, we love our fitness gear. This blatant contradiction is what makes America so American. So don't cross off FIT stock just yet - it may just surprise you.;As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;"10 Companies That Should Fear Donald Trump's     ""America First"" Plans";7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017;The post;Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Ugly as Sin, But Has a Chance for Redemption;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.

Its cash hoard,;$237 billion at the end of October;, is continuing to grow and it will nearly top the entire GDP of Finland.;What investors should be asking, however, isn't what Apple has done, but what it is going to do.;AAPL's Future: Augmenting, Grounding Reality;Start with augmented reality, the technology you saw last year, in a primitive way, with the Pokemon Go phenomenon.;10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second Wind;At CES, the German;Carl Zeiss Meditec NPV;(OTCMKTS:;CZMWF;), which has a pair of Virtual Reality goggles in the market, had a booth in the augmented reality area but no product to show. Although it is still a rumor,;Robert Scoble discovered solid evidence;"that the company is working with Apple on ""mixed reality"" glasses that could debut next year.";Augmented reality, as opposed to virtual reality, superimposes computer data on an existing world view. In the workplace, it can give repairmen instructions as they work. In addition to superimposing games on your worldview, it can also deliver marketing messages as you walk, or interface with your smartphone so you can see your directions as you drive, and don't forget what is on your to-do list.;Such;a heads-up display;from Apple would be a real breakthrough, transforming the way people work with technology from looking down at screens to looking up and saying what they want.;"The breakthrough would lie in creating an interface that is not distracting to either the wearer or the people around them, as the ""Google glass"" effort from";Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;) proved to be.;That's not all. AAPL has also patented an armband that could deliver;a host of health indicators;, not just blood pressure and heart rate, to the wearer and their doctor. Wearables are currently stuck as fashion devices because they lack the precision and utility needed for Food and Drug Administration approval, but breaking through that wall would open a multi trillion-dollar market.;Apple Is Taking the High End;While most analysts focus on absolute market share, investors know that the key to a mass technology market lies in who has the high end, where the biggest profits lie. I was shocked over the holidays to find I am now the only member of my family still carrying an Android phone. All my relatives now have iPhones.;This not only gives Apple 90% of the market's profits, but allows it to extend the ecosystem back to the PC, where it is now the fourth-largest player in;a stabilizing market;and, on a per-unit basis, the most profitable.;While Android developers struggle to get free apps onto phones, AAPL's iOS will pass;$1 trillion in revenue;sometime this year, delivering $20 billion per year to developers and justifying its spending billions of dollars to build-out a network of cloud data centers.;Apple Inc. (AAPL) MacBook Pro Out of Consumer Reports' Doghouse;Slice Intelligence estimates that Apple even had;one-quarter of the wireless headphone market;this Christmas with those Airpod units that analysts laughed at a few months ago.

Three decades later the stock has grown almost 70,000%.;The strategy also worked with;Apple Inc.;(;AAPL;),;Celgene Corporation;(;CELG;),;Biogen Inc;(;BIIB;), and dozens of other stocks. In each case, these stocks grew by 15,000% to 25,000%. The strategy successfully created millionaires out of ordinary people worried about retirement.;Now, you may think gains like this are impossible today. That's absolutely untrue. We're in the most exciting time in history. Technology will change more in the next 20 years than in all of recorded history.;That's not just hyperbole, either…;The technological advances of the coming decades make the invention of the automobile, airplane, computer  - and even the Internet - seem as mundane to our grandchildren and great-grandchildren as the invention of the wheel is to us.;…Yes, But How?;Several companies have the potential to disrupt their industries in the same way Microsoft and Apple have. Buying stock in these revolutionary companies will help millennials find financial security in their lifetimes.;One such company is;Energous Corp;(;WATT;).;The company's first generation devices provide wireless electricity to virtually any battery-powered device in your home. The wireless power can be used on a variety of electronic devices. This includes cell phones, tablets, wearables, cameras, wireless headsets, sensors, LED lights, and remote controls.;Now, if you're anything like me, wireless electricity sounds fundamentally impossible. So let me explain how it works…;A Radio Frequency (RF) system, similar to Wi-Fi, delivers wireless electricity to a distance of approximately 15 feet. The receiving device, like a mobile phone, is then charged without wires.  By employing multiple transmitters the system can cover an entire household. And because the system is software-controlled, it's intelligent, customizable, and can work invisibly in the background.;But this is just the beginning…;Second and third generation transmitters will send higher wattages greater distances -fundamentally changing how people use electricity - most notably for the 1.2 billion people who have never used electricity to light a room or refrigerate food.;As you can see from the chart below, WATT stock is up more than 128% since January 2016.;But don't let that scare you off. WATT is a long-term investment that will take another decade to experience the kind of exponential growth capable of solving millennials' retirement needs.;While we can't promise it's the next Apple, it has a good chance to be. Buy the stock and hold it forever. It will make the chaos of Social Security irrelevant.;The Best Investments for 2017;Risks To Consider:;The first generation transmitters work well over short distances. There are no guarantees that the technology will work over greater distances and at wattages necessary to power cities and remote villages. But the research is promising.;Action To Take:;Buy shares of WATT up to $25. Commit no more than 1-2% of your portfolio to Energous. Expect to see periods of high volatility inherent in new technologies. But don't use a stop-loss due to the long-term nature of the investment.

The resulting uptrend in interest rates promises to give bank stocks in general and Bank of America in particular a big boost. No doubt, Bank of America shares have been strong performers since the election - up +34.9% since November 8th vs. +21.8% gain for the Zacks Major Banks industry in that time period, but the analyst still sees plenty of upside in this Buy-rated stock.

OPEC's recent decision to cut production for the first time since 2008 is likely to assist the global;oil prices;to stabilize and further improve ConocoPhillips stock price. Multinational oil enterprises (like COP), on the back of greater certainty, will now be able revive spending on drilling activities. Improvement on the cost front is another positive.

PC Shipments Show Signs of Revival in Q4 Per Gartner & IDC;January 12, 2017, 08:45:00 AM EDT;Although worldwide PC shipments continued to decline for the ninth consecutive quarter, it is showing signs of stabilization as evident from the recently released data for fourth-quarter 2016 by two independent research firms - Gartner Inc.;IT;"and International Data Corporation (""IDC""). For full year 2016, the situation was similar as it marked the fifth consecutive year of annual fall, as per both the research firms.";The Data;The preliminary data released by Gartner showed that PC shipments in the quarter were down 3.7% year over year to 72.6 million units. The decline marked the ninth straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry. For the full year, Gartner stated that PC shipments fell 6.2% to 269.7 million units, continuing the annual trend of decline since 2012.;Gartner stated that among the top six vendors, Asus and Acer witnessed declines in PC sales, while the likes of Lenovo, HP Inc.;HPQ;, Dell and Apple;AAPL;recorded growth during the fourth quarter. However, companies under the Others category witnessed a 18.8% drop in PC shipments.;Lenovo has managed to retain its leading position with 21.7% market share. Most importantly, the company registered a year-over-year increase in PC sales for the first time after witnessing a decline for several quarters. Lenovo saw 1.6% growth in PC sales during the fourth quarter.;HP Inc. and Dell were the other gainers during the quarter and recorded the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Holding the second spot among worldwide PC vendors, HP Inc. registered 4.3% growth in PC shipments and raised its market share to 20.4% from 18.8% in the year-ago quarter. Dell, which occupied the third position, witnessed 5.4% growth and raised its market share to 14.8% from 13.5% in fourth-quarter 2015.;Apple made a comeback this quarter as it registered year-over-year growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. During the quarter, the company's Mac sales increased 2.4%, which helped it to improve its market share to 7.5% from 7%. It holds the fifth spot among the top six PC vendors.;Asus and Acer held the fourth and sixth spots respectively, witnessing a year-over-year decline in PC shipments of 8.5% and 4.4%.;IDC, on the other hand, stated that PC shipments fell 1.5% year over year to about 70.2 million units in the fourth quarter. For the full year, PC shipments were down 5.7% to 260 million units.;As usual, there were slight differences between the data provided by the two research firms. This is mainly due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. For example, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.'s;GOOGL;Chrome operating system. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation;MSFT;"tablets and ""detachables"" such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer, which are not taken into account by IDC.";However, IDC agreed with Gartner on tumbling PC shipments at Asus and other smaller companies as well as increasing sales at Lenovo, HP Inc. and Dell. Nonetheless, it has a different view on Apple, as the firm saw a 0.9% decline in fourth quarter PC shipments as against Gartner's projection of 2.4% growth.;Talking about the geographical performance, the two firms agreed that overall PC shipments across every region fell during the quarter. However, as per IDC, which shows Japan's sales separately, the region witnessed year-over-year growth for the second consecutive quarter.;Concerns;Talking about the challenges faced by vendors during the quarter, the firms stopped blaming Brexit and the delay in fully deploying Windows 10 operating systems by enterprises, and instead held sluggish demand responsible for the PC shipment decline.;"Gartner, in particular, cited weak back-to-school demand and ongoing low demand in the consumer market, especially in emerging markets, as the main reason for the decline in PC shipments. Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner stated that, ""Similar to low-key back to school sales in 3Q16, big sales events, such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday and holiday sales are no longer effective marketing opportunities for PCs since PC purchases are generally driven by a 'need,' rather than 'want,' motivation"".";Furthermore, as per Gartner, Asia/Pacific region witnessed the highest fall in the quarter. This was mainly because of two reasons - demonetization of the Indian currency and success of China's 11.11 (Singles Day on Nov 11, 2016) online shopping event.;IDC agreed on Gartner's views on the performance of the Asia/Pacific region, but also mentioned that although the demonetization crisis in India had affected PC sales initially in the country, it has recovered significantly toward the end of the quarter.;Extended lifecycle of the PC as a result of the availability of a wide range of alternative computing devices is another reason behind the overall decline.;Bottom Line;Though both the research firms reported a year-over-year decline in global PC shipments, we believe that the downtrend has become rather modest in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarters. For the first, second and third quarters of 2016, IDC had reported an 11.5%, 4.5% and 3.9% drop in PC shipments, while Gartner's figures stood at 9.6%, 5.2% and 5.7%, respectively.;Furthermore, the two firms stated that PC vendors are now coming with innovative products such as 2-in-1s and thin and light notebooks as well as technology enhancements, which can make customers opt for a new PC.;Moreover, the two firms also agreed on the view that PC sales will witness stabilization in the quarters ahead as the demand for relatively inexpensive mobile computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets are slowing down.;"However, Kitagawa opined that ""This side of the market is much bigger than the PC enthusiast segment; thus, steep declines in the infrequent PC user market offset the fast growth of the PC enthusiast market.""";"She further added that ""although the overall PC market will see stagnation, there are growth opportunities within the market, such as the engaged PC user market, the business market and gaming. However, these growth areas will not prevent the overall decline of the PC market, at least in the next year.""";Therefore, from the long-term perspective, PCs have to compete with mobile computing devices as returning to growth is still a distant possibility. In our opinion, PC manufacturers have a bigger problem to deal with - cost of device - to ensure long-term growth.;Nonetheless, for the time being, an improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Intel Corporation;INTC;, Seagate Technologies;STX;and Western Digital;WDC;, which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.;Currently, Seagate sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Microsoft and Western Digital carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Simply put: It's difficult to know what's coming next.";The fact is the president-elect has shown a knack for changing his mind like no other. That said, at least month's tech summit, Trump did make an abrupt and positive change in attitude toward Facebook and its compadres.;Much to our surprise - and probably CEO Mark Zuckerberg's - Trump went so far as to say the administration was ready to do anything it could for the tech industry, saying;"""this is truly an amazing group of people.""";FB Stock Chart;Click to Enlarge;The last time I wrote about FB back at the tail end of November, I wasn't particularly keen on shares. A longstanding uptrend was intact, but our concern was that as a growth stock, Facebook was prone to becoming its own worst enemy.;The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' Picks;The fact is technical corrections in even the most liked stocks are all too common and typically blindside bulls with little warning. Facebook seemed to fit the bill. FB stock already was showing some loose testing of its 200-day simple moving average. Given Trump's less gentle message toward tech stocks at the time, the question of when we'd see a correction appeared to be on the doorstep.;Lo and behold, a correction did emerge, but its technical conclusion definitely surprised this strategist. Facebook stock held the existing 15% correction, and half of the 30% decline accepted as par for the course among growth traders. The corrective activity in FB went on to establish a symmetrical triangle centered around the 200-day moving average before scoring a surprising breakout to the upside.;Currently, FB shares are consolidating just below resistance defined by a bearish earnings gap from Nov. 3. The 62% retracement level is another barrier that lines up with the FB gap.;So, where will Facebook stock head next?;While I'm impressed at the rally of the past couple weeks, it's hard to like FB stock given the modest correction to date and current overhead resistance. At the same time, it's difficult to wield a heavy-handed bearish grudge when Facebook has displayed some technical strength.;How to Trade FB Stock Right Now;The good news: A bearish butterfly will help anyone who anticipates more downside to position themselves in Facebook stock with less capital commitment and the potential for outsized profits.;I like the weekly 24 Feb $120/$113/$106 long butterfly. Shares closed Wednesday at $125.60, and the trade is priced at 90 cents. Risk is less than 1% of Facebook stock risk no matter where shares end up on Feb. 24.;Donald Trump Puts Humana Inc (HUM) Stock on My     Buy Radar;Facebook is set to announce earnings on Feb. 1, and the last event resulted in a bearish closing price of $120. This trade is somewhat positioned for history to repeat itself.;The spread will have three weeks of life following the event. Ideally, the sweet spot down at $113 could stand to gain as much as $6.10, or more than 600%, in a picture-perfect scenario at expiration.;I'm not holding my breath for that, but I do like the approach, and I do like the idea of a small undercut of the November low of $113.55 in FB stock during the holding period.;"Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

Apple: Why Dabble in Original TV, Movie Content? Just Buy Netflix;January 12, 2017, 08:30:03 AM EDT;The iPhone turned ten years old this week, but Apple (;AAPL;) won't be solely relying on another ten years of iPhone sales, especially with the device coming off its first year-on-year sales decline since its inception. But is TV and movies the answer?;According to the Wall Street Journal;, the Cupertino-based tech giant is planning to build a “significant new business in original television shows and movies.” Citing sources, the Journal said that the programming would be available to subscribers of Apple’s $10-a-month streaming-music service. Apple execs are reportedly gearing to offer original scripted content by the end of 2017, the Journal said. Shows like “Westworld” on Time Warner’s (;TWX;) HBO is said to be the genre Apple is interested in.;While Apple’s existing streaming service does include a small slate of documentary-style segments on musicians, what does it know about TV shows and movies? Apple’s ambition to become a bigger player in Hollywood beyond just music would immediately put it a domain currently dominated by Netflix (;NFLX;) and Amazon (;AMZN;) — two companies with large libraries of award-winning/Golden Globe-nominated hits.;"makeArticleAd();";Despite Apple’s massive cash stockpile of some $240 billion, Apple isn’t willing to spend the level of cash it it would take to launch a successful streaming franchise. It would also require ongoing investments in original programming to remain competitive with Netflix and Amazon. To that end, it would make sense for Apple, which has held multiple talks with Hollywood producers about buying rights to scripted television programs, to just acquire Netflix.;Growing its TV, movie ambitions via the M&A route is something Apple has been linked to for quite some time.;Bloomberg reported that;Eddy Cue, Apple's head of iTunes store, Apple Music and iCloud, reportedly met with Time Warner executives in Manhattan last year about an acquisition. This was long before AT&T (;T;) stepped in and closed the deal. But Bloomberg also reported that Netflix is the more likely candidate for Apple since Netflix would make it easier for Apple to offer a wide range of content.;"""We would definitely buy something larger than we bought thus far,"" CEO Tim Cook said while answering a question about Apple’s M&A interest. ""It's more about the strategic fit and whether it's great technology and great people. And so we continue to look, and we stay very active in the M&A market.""";Buying Netflix is something that's been discussed for some time. And with Apple now relying more on its services business, which grew 22% last quarter, to offset iPhone sales, Netflix is an asset Apple desperately needs rather than building its own TV, movie franchise. In the process, Apple would have a service it can bundle with Apple Music to help it differentiate itself from rival Spotify.

Apple, Inc. Continues to Slip in China;January 11, 2017, 05:57:00 PM EDT;Local Chinese manufacturers continue to chip away at iOS.   Image source: Apple.;You win some, you lose some.;"makeArticleAd();";Kantar;has released its most recent estimates on numerous smartphone   markets around the world, covering the three months ending   November 2016 before the holiday shopping season picked up steam.   Well, the news is mixed.;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) was able to chip away at;Alphabet;'s(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) lead in key geographies in   Europe as well as the U.S., but continued to slip in greater   China, where local manufacturers are flooding the market with   low-cost Android devices.;Let's dig through the numbers.;The good;The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the top three   handsets within the U.S. for the period, grabbing a combined 31%   market share. Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge came in at the No.   4 and No. 5 spots and accounted for 29% of sales. Aggressive   carrier promotions helped both the Mac maker and the South Korean   conglomerate, as all the domestic carriers had various promotions   to get a free flagship devices. Overall, iOS grew within the U.S.   by 6.4 percentage points to grab a 43.5% market share.;Interestingly, Google's decision to partner with;Verizon;"as the exclusive carrier distributing the Pixel seems to be   paying off, with the Pixel comprising about 1.3% of all   smartphone sales; over half of those new phones were activated at   Big Red. That may not sound like a whole lot, but it's actually   impressive when you consider that Nexus and Pixel phones have   never been high-volume devices, so 1.3% is actually pretty good   within that context.";In Europe, Apple did particularly well within the U.K., where   it saw its market share jump 9.1 percentage points, and now has a   48.3% share in the country. iOS also jumped by 6.5 percentage   points in France to a 24.5% market share. In the broader EU5   (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.), Apple had 24.6%   share of all smartphone sales.;The bad;Apple has seen its position in China deteriorate over;the past year;or so, while local players have been able to rise and chip away   at both Apple and larger Android original equipment   manufacturers. Android now accounts for 80% of smartphones sold   in the Middle Kingdom, which is the largest smartphone market in   the world. iOS fell from 25.3% of urban China to just 19.9%,   although Apple was up modestly on a sequential basis. The only   silver lining here is that the iPhone 7 was the single   best-selling device in urban China, grabbing 6.6% of all   sales.;The problem is that there are so many other low-cost Android   choices out there that make up the rest of the market (Huawei and   Oppo now represent nearly 40% of the market). Apple's business in   China is still on a long-term upward trajectory and I have little   doubt that the company will recover, but it's definitely seen   better days.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's All the New IoT Technology TDK Corp. Will Get From Buying InvenSense;January 11, 2017, 02:02:00 PM EDT;Image source: Getty Images.;Towards the end of 2016,;TDK Corporation;(NASDAQOTH: TTDKY) struck a deal to acquire;InvenSense;(NYSE: INVN) for $1.33 billion. The acquisition was made, in   part, to boost TDK's Internet of Things (IoT) opportunities,   which is now looking like an even smarter move than before, with   InvenSense's recent release of new IoT technologies last   week.;IoT is expected to be a $7.1 trillion market by 2020, and TDK   is hoping to use InvenSense' micro electro-mechanical sensors, or   MEMS, to help the company transition from the mobile market to   the IoT.;"makeArticleAd();";So, here's all the new technology InvenSense just released   that could help make that a reality for TDK.;The world's first seven-axis motion sensor;InvenSense said last week that it has started production of   the world's first seven-axis motion sensor, called the ICM-20789.   The company said the product builds on InvenSense's successful   6-axis motion sensor by adding a new pressure sensor into the   mix.;The ICM-20789 will be marketed primarily to the prosumer and   smart drone market (part of the broader IoT) to improve flight   take-off and landings, as well as improve stability when a drone   is in hover mode by implementing accurate elevation control.   InvenSense's motion sensors are some of the best in the business,   and this new one with a pressure sensor could become the standard   for smart drones.;Microphone for home IoT devices;The company debuted a new signal-to-noise (SNR) 74-decibel   analog microphone that InvenSense said can be used for in-home   and Internet of Things devices. The new mic provides very low   noise audio capturing and can be used with beamforming and audio   processing algorithms.;Voice commands have become the go-to way to communicate with   home IoT devices (think Amazon's Echo and Google Home), so   focusing on high-end microphones for these types of devices could   help InvenSense -- and eventually TDK -- make more inroads into   the IoT component segment.;The ICS-40730 is only available for sampling right now,   but InvenSense said it'll enter mass production in the third   quarter of this year.;6-axis motion sensor specially tuned for wrist-worn     wearables;An important part of the consumer IoT market is wrist-worn   wearables, primarily fitness bands and smartwatches.;InvenSense isn't new to the wrist-worn space, but the newly   tuned ICM-20648 combines 3-axis gyroscope sensors and 3-axis   accelerometer sensors with the company's updated software stack   to improve step count and activity classification (walk, run,   bike, sitting still) in wrist-worn wearables.;"The sensor also incorporates a ""Bring-to-See"" (B2S) capability   much like the";Apple;Watch's, where power is conserved in the device by having the   screen off until a wearer raises her arm to view the device.;The company says adding all of these capabilities into its   wearable tech sensor will speed up time-to-market timelines for   original equipment manufacturers and will be available in the   second quarter of this year.;Continued integration with more IoT platforms;InvenSense announced that its SensorStudio graphical software   development tool can now connect to;Samsung;'s Artik IoT platform to make it easier to program sensors and   algorithms for IoT devices.;"The company said in a press release that, ""The integrated   Samsung Artik Smart IoT platform provides the fastest path to   secure, interoperable, and intelligent IoT products and   services.""";"InvenSense said that SensorStudio and its FireFly ICM-30670   Development Kit are now compatible with Artik, and that the   integration ""helps our customers transmit their sensors &   algorithms outputs faster"" with end-to-end security.";Partnerships and compatibility are a big part of the IoT, as   many companies have gone in their own direction and set their own   standards. With the InvenSense/Samung announcement, InvenSense is   signaling to the IoT market that it wants its components to be   integrated with platforms designed by other companies.;What all of this means for TDK;"TDK already sells some of its sensors, and it said when it   made its acquisition bid for InvenSense that, ""Sensors are viewed   as an important IoT-enabling technology, and TDK envisions   greatly expanding this portion of its business and providing a   broad range of sensor solutions to its customers.""";"The company is looking to transition from a smartphone   component supplier to an IoT leader, and it called the Internet   of Things the ""next big technology wave that we will be riding"".    With the new InvenSense technologies listed above (which   will soon become TDK's) and the company's current sensor tech, it   appears the company is on the right path to see that plan play   out.";10 stocks we like better than InvenSense;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now...and InvenSense wasn't one of     them!

Apple (AAPL) is in Overbought Territory: What's Next?;January 11, 2017, 10:53:00 AM EDT;Apple Inc.;AAPL;has moved higher as of late, but there could definitely be trouble on the horizon for this company. That is because AAPL is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 70.36.;What is RSI?;"RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.";Other Factors;Yet AAPL's high RSI value isn't the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in Apple's stock as of late. This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of AAPL's prospects for the near term.;Over the past two months, investors have witnessed 3 earnings estimates revision lower compared to 2 higher for the current year. The consensus estimate for AAPL has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too, as the estimate has fallen from $9.06/share two months ago to just $9.02/share today.;If this wasn't enough, Apple also has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Cuts Production, But It May Not Be Time to Run;January 11, 2017, 10:20:45 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;While the world was singing Auld Lang Syne on New Year's Eve, the Whiz Kids in Cupertino were singing a much different tune - one that was a bit sadder. It turns out that;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) may have a huge problem on its hands. It may not be selling as many iPhones as we all think.;Source:;Beni Krausz via Unsplash;A new report from a credible source surfaced over the long weekend that suggests that Apple may be planning to cut production of its two flagship smartphones by double-digits during the first quarter.;"makeArticleAd();";Some analysts have jumped on the potential production cuts as the latest in;a series of missteps;for Apple and could serve as a major warning sign that its dominance in the world of tech could finally be waning. Just as other smartphone rivals and pioneers have succumbed to their success.;Or it could just be simply noise.;For investors, looking deeper into the report provides the answer.;AAPL Cuts Are Big;Nikkei Inc.;may not be a household name here in the U.S., but the 140-year-old publishing firm is one of the largest business and financial publications in the world. It's Asia's;Wall Street Journal;or;Financial Times;- which it now owns. So it's a real and credible news source.;10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not     Help It;The paper;looked into;AAPL supplier data, and what they found was a bit troubling. According to;Nikkei;, recent cuts in parts ordering would mean that Apple is planning on cutting its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus production by roughly 10% during the first quarter of 2017. This round of manufacturing cuts follows a 20% cut to the production of the iPhone 7 at the start of this year.;The reason for the cuts is easy to discern. AAPL simply isn't selling as many of its flagship smartphones as it thought it would.;During its last earnings report;, Apple announced a 9% decline in annual revenues. This drop was the first time that AAPL saw falling sales figures in nearly 15 years. iPhones contribute more than 2/3 of Apples total revenues. So they are to blame for the drop in total sales.;Activation data;from Localytics helps support lower sales and Nikkei's estimates of the upcoming production cuts.;Analysts have postulated that the iPhone 7's lack of innovative features and the fact that wireless carriers no longer subsidize smartphone purchases as the main reasons for the sales decline. People are holding on to their iPhones longer. There is simply aren't as many reasons to upgrade as fast anymore.;For AAPL stock, this is a major blow. Apple thrives on continued sales of its latest products to keep its growth and profits going. So the fact that it has cut its main flagship product line is very troubling. Cue the hallucinations of;Motorola;RAZR's, old;Nokia Corp (ADR);(NYSE:;NOK;) brick phones and;BlackBerry Ltd's;(NASDAQ:;BBRY;) dancing around Tim Cook's head. Lower sales followed by dwindling production was precisely when those wireless stories began their decent.;Why The Cuts at AAPL Stock May Not Mean Anything;So on the one hand, the production cuts and declining revenues at Apple could signal trouble for AAPL stock.;On the other, it could mean absolutely nothing.;For one thing, AAPL isn't alone in the seeing lower revenues thanks in part to customers keep their phones for longer. It's a common trend across the entire industry. According to tech research company IDC, global smartphone shipments in 2016 were barely higher than 2015's levels. The key for Apple is that its phones still are the number one selling brand in the world. So even though the overall pie is getting smaller, Apple's piece is still the biggest.;"Secondly, the production cuts could just mean that Apple is gearing up for the long-awaited iPhone 8 release. The truth is, when looking at its history, there have been several iPhone models that could be considered ""throw-aways."" These bridges and fillers are needed until AAPL can design the tech that it wants to for a new feature. But you have to give the people something. That was especially important when upgrading smartphones took place at faster rates.";Given its lack of innovation, the iPhone 7 Series could be thought of like that bridge line of phones.;You can speculate all you want, but there's a good chance that the iPhone 8 will be packed with new features - perhaps even more so considering that this year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. I'd be willing to bet that AAPL has something special up its sleeve.;"And finally, the production cuts and dropping revenues are meaningless because of the more $200 billion in cash on its balance sheet. That sheer amount of cash means that AAPL can ""kick the can"" for a long while before it must act. It has the luxury of being able to try out different ideas and see if they stick.";Should You Buy Amgen Inc. (AMGN) Stock? 3 Pros,     3 Cons;That wasn't the case for NOK, Motorola and BBRY, which had some serious debts to deal with and a lack of that sort of monster cash pile.;Apple Isn't Going Anywhere;So on the surface, the production cut news could be quite troubling indeed. But the reality of the situation is that Apple will be just fine. The firm is still the reigning king of the smartphone hill and that fact isn't going away. New product launches should help it keep its lead, and its monster cash balance should give it time to develop those products. Investors in AAPL stock shouldn't worry about the report from Nikkei.;As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017;"7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     Bank";The post;Apple Inc.

Large Cap Growth ETF (SPYG) Hits New 52-Week High;January 11, 2017, 10:09:00 AM EDT;For investors seeking momentum,;SPDR S&P 500 Growth ETF;SPYG;is probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up roughly 22% from its 52-week low price of $88.09/share.;"makeArticleAd();";But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let's take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:;SPYG in Focus;SPYG provides exposure to the growth stocks of the large cap segment with key holdings in information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare and industrials. However, it has a significant concentration on the top firm - Apple;AAPL;- at 6.1% while other firms hold less than 4.7% of assets. The product charges investors 15 basis points in fees (see:;all the Large Cap ETFs here;).;Why the Move?;The growth space of the broad U.S. stock market has been an area to watch lately given their outperformance on Trump euphoria and improving domestic fundamentals.

Additionally, solid manufacturing and industrial activities across the globe are providing a boost to these stocks.;More Gains Ahead?;Currently, SPYG has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or Hold rating with a Medium risk outlook.

Apple Inc.

Supply chain noise has been one factor   holding back Apple stock, but as has long been the case with the   Wall Street darling, analysts see plenty of upward catalysts   coming up this year.;"makeArticleAd();";"Additionally, there's a bit of positive supply chain ""noise""   from one analyst this morning.";Apple Monitor Beats the Typical Seasonality;Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a research note on   Jan. 9 that all of the companies in his Apple monitor reported   better-than-usual sales for December. His Monitor includes key   Taiwan-based suppliers for the iPhone maker. He said final   December sales declined 2% month over month but beat the 11-year   average of an 11% decline. This year's decline was also a major   improvement over the December 2015 decline of 31% month over   month and is better than the five-year average of a 6%   decline.;After including December, White said fourth quarter Apple   Monitor sales grew 11% missing the 11-year average of a 19%   sequential increase but better than the 7% increase in the   December 2015 quarter. He also reminded investors that the Apple   Monitor recorded its best September quarter ever in the third   quarter.;Further, he said this was the first time the sales cycle for   the Monitor flipped into the green in 12 months after marking a   19% increase year over year in December, versus a 15% decline   year over year just the month before.;"Apple Stock Still ""underappreciated""";"The analyst continues to see Apple stock as one of the world's   most ""underappreciated"" stocks. He continues to expect CEO Tim   Cook to ""make Apple grow again"" in the December quarter thanks to   the iPhone 7 and ""a happy holiday season."" He also anticipates a   strong iPhone 8 cycle in September and further ""color on future   innovations."" Another possible catalyst he sees for Apple stock   is improved tax repatriation policies.";The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The       Experts' Picks;"White highlighted that one big thing which came out of the   Consumer Electronics Show las week was that ""everything is   becoming a computer."" In his view, Apple is the world's only   consumer-focused computer-related company that also develops   software to work seamlessly with its hardware.";He also revived the Apple Car theme, noting that the   self-driving car was also a key focus of CES this year.   Automakers showed off Apple's CarPlay, which is now available in   more than 200 models offered by 40 different automakers.;Despite reports that the iPhone maker shifted its focus away   from developing a full car to developing the underlying   technology for a car, White sees an Apple;Car;"becoming the ""iPhone of the future.""";Apple Stock is Morgan Stanley's Top Hardware Pick;Morgan Stanley;(;MS;") analyst Katy Huberty chimed in on catalysts for Apple stock   with her own report dated Jan. 8. She declared the iPhone maker's   shares one of their top picks in U.S. IT Hardware for this year   as she named a handful of possible catalysts for them. She feels   that investors are too focused on ""supply chain noise"" and not   focused enough on the three catalysts she sees, although   certainly White's supply chain update is good news for the   company.";There have been multiple signs that Apple is not doing well in   China, with its own earnings reports showing;tumbling sales there;being the most obvious indicator.;"However, Huberty takes a positive spin on this, saying that   the recent iPhone weakness indicates ""pent-up demand, especially   in China, ahead of a major form factor change with significant   technology enhancements, including improved battery technology.""   She actually disagrees that China is a risk, seeing it instead as   an opportunity because of the weak demand.";She believes Chinese consumers remain loyal to the Apple   brand, noting that the iPhone maker continues to hold an 80%   share of the high-end of the smartphone market. As a result, she   sees the lack of demand as the result of a lack of form factor   change with the iPhone 6s and 7, so she expects the iPhone 8 to   spur demand in China. She agrees with the rumors that this year   will finally bring an iPhone with an AMOLED screen.;Huberty expects data points from the company's supply chain to   boost Apple stock late in the first quarter, although White's   report provides an early point of interest for those following   the supply chain. Huberty is eyeing a return to double-digit   growth for iPhone units, and her analysis points to at least a   20% increase in unit growth simply from a flat upgrade rate in   China.;3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is       About to Catch Fire;She's not the only one expecting the iPhone 8 to significantly   boost unit sales, as Nomura predicted recently that the phone   will;shatter all past sales records;.;Tax Reform Will Also Help Apple stock;The Morgan Stanley analyst also talked up the benefits of tax   repatriation, which has widely been discussed by much of Wall   Street since Donald Trump's surprise election. Huberty noted that   the company has $216 billion trapped outside the U.S.;The third catalyst she mentioned is also tax-related, as she   expects any;tax reform;in the U.S. to benefit the iPhone maker.

Apple Working on AR Glasses, Brings Carl Zeiss on Board;January 11, 2017, 09:22:00 AM EDT;Per tech blogger, Robert Scoble, who cited a Carl Zeiss employee,;Apple Inc.;AAPL;is working on augmented reality (AR)/mixed reality headsets and has partnered with the renowned lens maker. The glasses could hit stores as early as this year.;Scoble further added that at CES 2017, Zeiss had an exhibit but there were no AR products on display, primarily because of Apple's aversion to make anything public right now.;"There have been quite a few rumors regarding Apple's AR efforts as CEO Tim Cook has consistently emphasized on developing the technology time and again in the last few months. He has been quoted saying ""AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity."" In fact, he has been quoted by media reports saying not VR but AR will be ""the larger of the two, probably by far"".";"In November last year, Bloomberg stated that Apple was mulling venturing into the wearable headsets space but is unlikely to initiate ""mass production"" as it has just ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing purposes from a supplier.";Apple is under great pressure to introduce new products as demand for iPhones has been marred by global macroeconomic weakness due to currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe. In fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone's sales were down 12% year over year while unit sales were down 8%. Sluggish demand is a major concern as iPhone alone contributes over 60% to the company's total revenue.;Last year, for the first time in 15 years, Apple reported a year-over-year decline in its overall revenues. The company's revenues in fiscal 2016 were down 7.7% to $215.6 billion. Per the SEC filing, revenues were 3.7% below the targeted number for the last fiscal year.;Apple Inc. Price;Apple Inc. Price;|;Apple Inc. Quote;Even the much hyped Apple watch hasn't been of much help. Though Apple is working extensively on its other offerings like App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, these are not yet strong enough to lower the company's dependence on the iPhone.;With so much buzz created by AR/VR and AI technologies, Apple has started to focus on the development of these technologies. These are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.;All tech giants, right from Alphabet;GOOGL;, Facebook;FB;to Microsoft;MSFT;are scrambling to grab a share of this lucrative market. Facebook had acquired Oculus in 2012 to fuel the company's ambitious VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held last month, Facebook announced another $250 million investment to develop a VR content ecosystem.

Moreover, Apple is rumoured to launch three iPhones (instead of two) including a new 5.8 inch model.";However, surprises do not end here.;"Per Forbes, which quoted DigiTimes as source, Apple will use forged stainless steel chassis from Jabil to build the new iPhone instead from its main supplier Foxconn. The chassis would be used to sandwich together front and rear glass panels using ""metal forging"" instead of ""billet milling"".";"According to Forbes, """;Milling essentially cuts the chassis from a piece of aluminium, while forging essentially squeezes the metal alloy into the mould using extreme pressure. The benefit of this latter method is the metal is much stronger;"."" Metal forging will allow the company to build a slimmer and thinner core chassis without sacrificing structural integrity.";Foxconn Suffers from Lower iPhone sales;Meanwhile, Jabil's prominence as a supplier for the new iPhone does not bode well for Foxconn. The company's fortunes are largely tied up with sales of iPhone as evident from the recent annual results. Notably, Apple contributes almost half of Foxconn's sales.;According to Bloomberg, Foxconn also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, reported first annual revenue decline in 2016 since its listing in 1991. The 2.8% decline in sales was primarily attributed to slowdown in smartphone sales, maturing markets and sluggish economic background in China.;Further, Apple reported annual sales decline in 2016 (since 2001) due to lackluster iPhone sales. In fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone's unit sales were down 5.3% year over year.

But will Netflix be able live up to higher   expectations for subscriber growth in Q4?;Image source: Netflix.;"makeArticleAd();";Netflix's impressive member growth;In Netflix's third quarter, the company added 3.6 million new   subscribers, easily surpassing the company's guidance for 2.3   million net adds. While these additions were about equal to the   company's net member additions in the third quarter of 2015, it   was a substantial rebound from the company's underwhelming 1.7   million net member additions in Q2.;Netflix's growth in new members was particularly notable in   its international markets, where the streaming-video giant   expected to add 2 million new members but instead added 3.2   million.;The better-than-expected international net adds were fueled by   an optimistic global response to the company's original content   and by improving localization in some of its international   markets, management said in the company's third-quarter   shareholder letter.;Ahead of Netflix's third-quarter results, there were doubts   about the streaming-video giant's ability to continue growing   subscribers rapidly in the wake of strengthening streaming-video   competition. As competitors taste success with their growing   streaming video offerings, concerns have mounted about whether   Netflix can maintain a competitive advantage in the space.;For instance,;Time Warner;'s(NYSE: TWX) a la carte HBO NOW streaming-video service and its   HBO GO streaming service, which is offered as an add-on to some   cable and internet plans, are reportedly doing very well.;HBO Now for Apple TV.

We expect that   to continue, of course, across all of our digital distribution,   including HBO GO,"" said Time Warner's HBO CEO Richard Plepler in   the company's most recent earnings call.";To help boost its subscriber growth, Time Warner is now even   expanding the distribution of HBO GO by partnering with wireless   carriers like;AT&T;(NYSE: T) to offer it alongside internet plans instead of   limiting it to a cable TV add-on. And this distribution tactic   could gain even more traction if the pending AT&T and Time   Warner acquisition closes, making another Netflix competitor even   stronger.;But Netflix has continued to impress even as competition has   stepped up both original content creation and streaming video   offerings.;What to expect in Q4;Netflix's recent impressive growth in streaming members raises   the stakes for the company going into the fourth quarter. After   gaining so many new members in its third quarter, Netflix said it   anticipated adding 5.2 million new members in Q4 -- 1.45 million   in the U.S. and 3.75 internationally.;Ahead of Netflix's fourth-quarter results, investors should   keep in mind that the company's quarterly guidance for member   growth hasn't always proved to be very accurate, particularly in   2016. Indeed, it was just in the second quarter of 2016 when   Netflix significantly underperformed its own guidance for both   international and local subscriber growth. Therefore, given how   difficult it is even for management to predict quarterly   subscriber growth, investors should refrain from making any bets   on the company's fourth-quarter subscriber growth.;But the uncertainty surrounding Netflix's fourth-quarter   subscribers doesn't diminish its importance. Given the stock's   pricey valuation, investors should hope the company meets or   exceeds its guidance for subscribers, proving the streaming-video   leader can continue to grow nicely even as competitors step up   their game.;Netflix investors will find out exactly how many new   subscribers the company added when it reports fourth-quarter   results on Wednesday, Jan. 18.;10 stocks we like better than Netflix;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

How to Trade Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock After Earnings;January 11, 2017, 08:02:15 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;Shares of large-cap bank stocks such as;Bank of America Corp;(NYSE:;BAC;) rallied sharply following America's presidential election last   November. Over the past few weeks, however, BAC stock has largely   been stuck in a consolidation phase. The next catalyst for   shares? Fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, Jan. 13.;Here's my plan on how to trade Bank of America stock following   its report.;"makeArticleAd();";When it comes to trading stocks near their respective earnings   reports, I have two primary rules:;Never hold trading positions through earnings reports.;Remain open-minded about the possible reactions to any     given stock around their earnings report.;I see too many traders (both novice and seasoned) attempt to   game earnings reports. Most walk away with little more than a   stressful time. While select options trades can make sense   through earnings reports, in my nearly 20 years as a trader, I   have found much better-probability trades set up on the back of   any given report (i.e., once the news is out).;When;I last mused about shares of Bank of America on   Dec. 5;, I offered that BAC stock looked overbought in the   near-term and needed at least a pause or pullback to become a   better buy into year-end again.;7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead       Weight Right Now;BofA merely ended up consolidating sideways into 2016's close,   so my call to take profits for the time being was a good one.;BAC Stock Charts;On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that the breakout past   horizontal resistance around the $19 mark following the November   election results was a powerful one.;Click to Enlarge;Although I believe BAC stock can see plenty more upside in   2017, my concern from this angle is the overbought reading we see   from the MACD oscillator at the bottom of the chart. Although   Bank of America doesn't have to fall apart from here as a result   of these readings, a continuation higher at the rate we saw in   November into December looks very unlikely.;On the daily chart, we see that the November rally confirmed a   break past diagonal resistance that took place in October. In the   meantime, and as a result of the last few weeks of sideways   consolidation, the intermediate term moving averages (yellow   50-day, blue 100-day and red 200-day) are getting a chance to   play a little catch-up with price - and that's a healthy   thing.;Click to Enlarge;Ultimately, one of these three moving averages will likely   need to be tested as support for BAC stock to be a better buy   again. That is to say, should BofA drop following this Friday's   report, traders would need to watch how shares react at any of   these three averages.;Any strong bullish reversals off one of these three MAs could   set up the next good buying opportunity.;Should I Buy Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock? 3 Pros,       3 Cons;Alternatively, should BAC stock rally and break out of the   recent multiweek consolidation phase following the earnings   report, quicker traders could look to hop on board and see if   momentum could sustain for a next upside target toward   $25-$26.;The highest-probability trade following earnings, in my   opinion, would set up if BAC stock were to rally but then quickly   stall and reverse lower. Such a scenario would allow traders to   enter short-side trades betting that the stock will mean revert   lower toward the $20 area as a first downside target.;Like what you see?

Should I Buy Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;January 11, 2017, 06:06:13 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) is just a few weeks away from its next earnings report. And   thanks to a lot of news in the past several months, it could   result in a big move for AAPL stock.;Last quarter, the tech company recorded its;first year-over-year revenue decline;since 2001. Those Apple earnings results were expected, of   course, but still not easy to swallow. Furthermore, profits   barely met expectations.;"makeArticleAd();";However, management didn't only have bad news to share with   AAPL stock holders. Forward guidance at the end of 2016 was very   strong, both for sales and margins, and that could mean a big   turnaround is in order when the next Apple earnings report   drops.;There are merits to either side of the trade, but should you   buy Apple Inc. here or sell the company right now? Here are three   pros and three cons to help you decide:;Pros of AAPL Stock;Value Play:;For all the talk about the end of Apple's go-go growth, it's   important to acknowledge the company has matured and evolved into   a strong value play. Right now the stock trades for just under 12   times future earnings, well under the forward price-earnings   ratio of about 19 for the;S&P 500;or;Nasdaq;indices.;7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks Lugging Dead       Weight;Cash King:;By the way, that forward P/E of 11 doesn't back out the copious   cash Apple Inc. is sitting on. Right now the tally is roughly   $220 billion, give or take, or about a third of its market cap.   If you don't think some of that money is accessible thanks to   repatriation issues, then consider the more than $50 billion in   annual free cash flow. That's plenty of dry powder right   there.;Return of Capital:;At its current perch of $119, AAPL stock yields a decent   1.9%. It also executed $29 billion worth of stock buybacks in the   prior four quarters. Between these dividends and buybacks, Apple   Inc. has returned more than;$186 billion;in capital to shareholders since 2012.;To keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer     clear of Apple stock, click here or use the navigation     below.;Cons of AAPL Stock;iPhone Overreliance:;Part of the reason growth has slowed for Apple stock lately is   because it is heavily reliant on its iconic iPhone to generate   revenue. Right now, the device still accounts for about   two-thirds of the top line, so it's very difficult to imagine   AAPL stock moving higher as this core part of its business decays   or flatlines.;Stuck in a Rut:;Shares have been bouncing around lately, but longer-term have   remained range bound between $100 and $120 a share since late   2014. Sure, if you bought AAPL stock at $100 and unloaded at $120   that's a nice 20% profit … but shares are now at the upper bounds   of that range again and that could mean a rocky road lies   ahead.;Should I Buy Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock? 3       Pros, 3 Cons;Tech Is Unforgiving:;"There's always a lot of lip service paid to ""innovative""   companies with a history of ""disruption,"" but history shows it is   quite rare for a once-dominant large-cap tech company to regain   its former glory after it stumbles. Whether you're talking about";Cisco Systems Inc.;(NASDAQ:;CSCO;),;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) or;recently acquired Yahoo Inc;, it's clear that once these big players take a breather,   newer and hungrier companies tend to step in and fill the space.

Apple, Inc. Is About to Expand U.S. Manufacturing, but It's Not What You Think;January 10, 2017, 09:09:00 PM EDT;Too bad we're not talking about iPhone manufacturing. Image   source: Apple.;Expanding domestic manufacturing is the popular;thing to do right about now, as President-elect Donald Trump   prepares to take office in just 10 days. We've already seen a   handful of domestic companies cave to the political pressure,   altering investment plans to focus on U.S. facilities in some   cases.;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) has also been dragged into the;debate;", for better or for worse. Well, the Mac maker is now reportedly   looking to expand its operations in Mesa, Arizona, and begin   ""high-tech manufacturing,"" according to";government documents;first noticed by;Business Insider;yesterday.;"makeArticleAd();";Apple is looking to assemble data center cabinets at the   facility, and they would be destined for use in Apple's other   data center facilities around the world. The company currently   assembles data center gear at each respective site, but this move   would consolidate the assembling in Mesa. Finished equipment will   be shipped to other Apple data centers within the U.S., according   to the report.;Might as well use it;This is really about Apple continuing to repurpose its Mesa,   Arizona, facility, which you may recall was initially built to be   a massive manufacturing site for sapphire glass back when the   iPhone maker had partnered with GT Advanced Technology, which   went;bankrupt;in late 2014 as a way to extricate itself from the ill-fated   supplier relationship. Apple had built the facility and was to   rent it out to GT Advanced, and the surprise bankruptcy   announcement left Apple with 1.2 million square foot of space to   repurpose.;In early 2015, Apple said it would invest $2 billion in the   facility to convert it to a green data center that would serve as   a sort of control center for the company's four other domestic   data centers. The Mesa, Arizona, facility would also focus on   storing iCloud and iTunes data. For the past few years, Apple has   been quietly designing its own servers and other back-end   infrastructure, in part to improve security.;"As far as jobs go, Apple will initially add approximately 150   ""high-paid"" jobs at the facility, according to the report. That's   good news for the local economy, but ultimately a drop in the   bucket. It's also not as if Apple is expanding the operations for   political purposes. The move is more about utilizing a facility   that Apple had already bought and paid for.";It looks like Trump will just have to keep on fighting for   domestic manufacturing jobs, since this isn't quite what he's   looking for.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Facts Apple Investors Should Know About the App Store;January 10, 2017, 08:46:00 PM EDT;Image source: Apple.;At the beginning of 2016,;Apple;"(NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook was faced with the fact that iPhone   sales would decline for the first time in history that year. To   shift Wall Street's focus away from the impending decline in unit   sales he aptly pointed out, ""A growing portion of our revenue is   directly driven by our existing install base. Because our   customers are very satisfied and engaged, they spend a lot of   time on their devices and purchase apps, content, and other   services.""";Indeed, while iPhone sales declined 12% in fiscal 2016,   Apple's services continued climbing higher for the year. A big   part of that growth is the continued increase in sales through   the App Store. Earlier this month, Apple provided a roundup of   App Store highlights from 2016. Here are the five most important   facts for Apple investors to know.;"makeArticleAd();";App developers earned $20 billion last year;Apple paid out $20 billion to iOS developers in 2016. That's   up 40% year over year, according to Apple.;The $20 billion paid to developers implies Apple kept over $8   billion in revenue for itself using its standard 30/70 split.   While some subscription services received a higher revenue share,   they still represent a relatively small percentage of App Store   revenue. Last year, Apple generated an estimated;$6 billion;in revenue from the App Store.;Apple's user base is significantly more willing to pay for   apps and services than Google's. The;Alphabet;(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) subsidiary consistently sees   little more than half the revenue from its Play Store as the App   Store, according to App Annie. That makes Apple's still-growing   install base extremely valuable even if iPhone unit sales   declined.;2.2 million apps available;The 2.2 million apps available for download in the App Store   represent a 20% increase year over year. Additionally, the most   recent update is indicative that developers are steadily adding   apps to the App Store. Apple announced that it reached 2 million   apps in June at its WWDC presentation -- just about the halfway   point of the year.;Several new apps made a big splash in 2016, including;Pokemon Go;and;Super Mario Run;. Just as importantly, if not more so, older games such as;Monster Strike;and;Fantasy Westward;were some of the top-grossing apps in the App Store.;While Apple is adding a good number of new apps, sales are   growing much faster. That's a good sign of an expanding user base   and a growing willingness to pay for apps.;$240 million in sales on New Year's Day;Jan. 1 was once again Apple's biggest sales day for the App   Store. Last year, it set a new record on New Year's Day with $144   million in sales. This year, sales rocketed 67% year over year to   $240 million.;That growth is a strong indicator that Apple may continue to   see robust growth from the App Store in 2017.;$2.7 billion in subscription revenue;Of the $28 billion or so in App Store sales, nearly 10% came   from subscriptions. This summer, Apple altered its revenue share   agreement with subscription services, dropping from a 30/70 split   to a 15/85 split after one year. This gave an incentive to more   subscription services to start offering subscriptions through the   App Store.;The growth of the Apple TV App Store also likely led to an   increase in subscription sales for Apple. 2016 represented the   first full year Apple opened the platform to all developers.;China grew 90%;App sales in China grew 90% year over year in 2016. China   surpassed the U.S. as the largest download market for iOS apps in   the first quarter, according to;App Annie;. However, it still trails the U.S. and Japan in terms of App   Store revenue for now.;While China represents one of Apple's largest markets, sales   in the region declined more than its other regions in 2016. The   iPhone 6 was extremely popular in the country during fiscal 2015,   leading to a decline in sales the next year. But App Store sales   continue to climb faster than Apple's average. That's indicative   of the large opportunity of the relatively young user base in the   region.;Overall, Apple's App Store had another great year of growth,   and 2017 looks to be off to a strong start.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for   over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

Don't Overlook This Underappreciated Apple, Inc. Business Segment;January 10, 2017, 02:01:00 PM EDT;When;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) reports its results for its first fiscal quarter   of 2017 on Jan. 31, many investors will likely turn immediately   to iPhone sales. After all, the important product accounts for a   whopping 60% of its revenue. Investors, however, shouldn't   overlook Apple's services segment. As the tech giant's   second-largest and fastest-growing product segment, it is crucial   to its business.;Apple's services revenue is increasing, driven primarily by   soaring App Store revenue. Image source: Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";A bright spot amid growth challenges;In Apple's fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, the services segment   stood out as an exception to the rest of the company's product   segments' flat or declining sales. Its services revenue, which   includes revenue from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud,   Apple Pay, licensing, and other services, increased an impressive   24% year over year. Meanwhile, revenue for the iPhone, Mac, and   other product segments declined, and iPad revenue was flat year   over year.;"CEO Tim Cook was particularly pleased with the company's   record-setting services revenue during the quarter. ""App Store   revenue continued to skyrocket, while Music revenue grew by 22%   thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music,"" he said. He   also noted that Apple is seeing ""very strong growth in   transaction volume through Apple Pay.""";Going forward, Cook explained the high expectations for the   segment:;We remain very confident about the future of our Services     business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction     and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost     doubled the size of our services revenue in the last 4 years,     and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a     Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017.;What would it look like for its services segment to be the   size of a Fortune 100 company? Currently, the company with the   lowest revenue on Fortune's top 100 list of companies has annual   revenue of $28 billion -- about $4 billion more than Apple's   services revenue in fiscal 2016. So, Apple believes its fiscal   2017 services revenue will exceed $28 billion.;Impressively, beyond being Apple's only segment that grew in   the fiscal fourth quarter, the segment also posted a meaningfully   higher growth rate than it did in the quarter before it.   Fourth-quarter services revenue increased 24% year over year.   This is up from 19% growth in Q3 and 20% growth in Q2.;To help drive greater interest to its streaming music     service, Apple overhauled the design of its Music app in 2016.     Image source: Apple.;What to expect from services in Q1;"For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, it's likely Apple can at   least maintain its current 24% year-over-year growth in services   revenue. CFO Luca Maestri said the company's App Store growth   rate has accelerated for five consecutive quarters, hitting a   rate of 43% year over year in the company's September-ended   fourth fiscal quarter of 2016.

This Old Apple Slogan Perfectly Explains What's Wrong With The Company Today;January 10, 2017, 01:14:00 PM EDT;For years, Apple;AAPL;, led by the late Steve Jobs, was a worldwide innovator and a pioneer in the technology industry. The company blazed trails in the hardware and software business, and without it, personal computing would certainly not be what it is today.;Even with the advent of the iPhone and the massive shift in company focus, Apple continued to shine by consistently offering one of a kind products. The Cupertino-based tech giant had a special way of making customers feel that their desktops, laptops, and phones were irreplaceable.;In return, Apple was rewarded with consistent sales growth and reliable stock performance. Over the past decade, AAPL has outperformed its Consumer Electronics industry competitors in all but two years thanks to the dominance of the iPhone.;Before that, it was the Macintosh computer that helped Apple stay on top of the technology industry. Check out this early TV spot to see how Apple thought of itself when the Mac was running the show:;Unfortunately, the days of Apple's unbridled dominance are long gone. In 2016, the company's annual sales dipped year-over-year for the first time since 2001, it saw its first ever iPhone sales declines, and critics lamented over design choices made on its new phones and laptops.;"As we know now, ""does more"" and ""costs less"" really don't describe many of Apple's products. The company has long-since held a reputation for being pricey, and we seem to no longer look at Apple for industrywide changes.";For example, the company was widely criticized for its decision to not include the standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Instead, users would have to plug new headphones or an adapter into the Lightning port, restricting the ability to charge and jam out at the same time.;The release of the new Apple Macbook Pro was also seen as a mess by some. While professional graphics artists and video editors desperately clamored for a new top of the line machine, Apple delivered a midrange laptop with a top-shelf price tag.;The company decided to use Intel's;INTC;older Skylake architecture and capped the machine's maximum RAM capacity at 16 GB, the same level it has been at for years. Apple also opted to make all of the Macbook Pro's ports USB-C, requiring many users to rely on dongles.;And these are simply design choices. None of this says anything about how the price of Apple's products has basically become a meme. I mean, let's not forget that Apple introduced a;$99 stylus;for its latest iPad.;While I admit that I am much better at pointing out problems than solving them, I think it is clear that Apple has strayed too far from the mentality that made it one of the most successful companies in the world.;Here's hoping Apple can get things back on track with some cool new products in 2017. If Tim Cook is reading this, remember: does more, costs less.;Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017;In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?;Who wouldn't?

Why the Dow Jones Industrial Average Is Pointless;January 10, 2017, 12:15:31 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;"For a couple of weeks now, we've all heard the talk of ""Dow 20,000."" And while the";Dow Jones Industrial Average,;as the index is officially called, hasn't quite reached 20,000, the very fact that anyone in the market even;cares;is striking. Because the Dow Jones itself is a measure of very low value, oddly set up and almost archaic in a computer age.;Source:;Hillary via Flickr;There's a lot of commentary that seems to imply that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is representative of the broad market. It's a strange claim, and it's hardly the case.;"makeArticleAd();";The Dow consists of just 30 stocks. And the DJIA is price-weighted, meaning that a stock's actual price is more important than the market valuation of the underlying company. While the index attempts to represent the U.S. economy as a whole, it comes nowhere close to representing U.S.;stock markets;as a whole.;So whether the Dow hits 20,000 or not should be of little interest to investors. It's just a number, and the mechanics of the Dow Jones Industrial Average mean that number isn't very meaningful.;It's Price-Weighted (Really);The smallest company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average by market cap is insurance firm;Travelers Companies Inc;(NYSE:;TRV;), worth roughly $33 billion. The largest market cap in the index is;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;), the most valuable company in the world, worth roughly $630 billion. In other words, Apple is worth ~19x as much as Travelers, at least in terms of its equity value.;"But the Dow Jones is not market cap-weighted; it's price-weighted. That literally means the index moves based on the share price of the respective components. AAPL closed trading Monday at $118.99. TRV closed at $117.32. What that means for the DJIA is that a 5% move in TRV impacts the index almost as much (in fact, 98.6% as much) as a 5% move in AAPL. That occurs even though Apple is";worth almost 20 times as much;as Travelers.;10 of the Worst Values on Wall Street;Because the DJIA is price-weighted, the most influential company in moving the Dow Jones Industrial Average isn't Apple or;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) or;Exxon Mobil Corporation;(NYSE:;XOM;). It's Goldman Sachs, which closed Monday at $242.89, the highest;share price;in the Dow. But Goldman, by market cap, actually is the seventh-;smallest;of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average issues, with a market cap just under $100 billion.;In contrast,;JPMorgan Chase & Co.;(NYSE:;JPM;) is worth more than three times as much as Goldman, yet contributes barely one-third as much to index performance as its smaller rival.;The impact of price-weighting isn't simply mathematical, or limited to the performance of the index. It affects the index itself. The only reason AAPL even is included is because it undertook a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014 - around the same time as;Visa's;(NYSE:;V;) 4-for-1 split. That left Visa's share price too low, as the Dow's owner;explained a year later;"when Apple was included, and allowed AAPL to enter with a more ""normal"" stock price.";The very fact that the Dow wouldn't have included AAPL - again, the world's most valuable company - because of its share price shows just how silly the index is.;And Only 30 Stocks;Apple is in the index now, but there are many notable omissions.;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;),;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;), and;Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;) all are excluded. Amazon, in fact, now suffers from the same problem that AAPL did three years ago, as its share price nears $800. (A champagne problem, to be sure.) But, like Apple in 2013-14, it seems crazy that Amazon.com doesn't even count in the Dow at all.;Indeed, the fact that the dominant retailer in the U.S. - a company that quite literally is reshaping the consumer landscape in this country - isn't included shows the limitations of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It is supposed to be a index that represents the U.S. economy, yet it doesn't include what seems like the most innovative, disruptive company in that economy.;"So why is the Dow Jones still used? Inertia is probably the most logical reason. The simplicity of the index and even its name lends itself to quick media soundbites. ""The Dow closed down 80 points today"" appears an easy way to describe the market's action.";But easy isn't accurate, particularly in this case.;Bank of America Corp (BAC) Q4 Earnings     Preview;The nature of the index lent itself well to market coverage decades ago. Changes in a 30-stock, price-weighted index could be calculated with pen, paper and a calculator (with the latter tool optional). But in the computer age, when second-by-second updates are available worldwide, for free, the insistence on following the Dow makes little sense.;The;S&P 500;has the limitation of focusing almost solely on large-cap stocks, but it at least accounts for ~80% of total U.S. market value by most estimates. The Wilshire 5000 covers almost the;entire;U.S. market. The;Russell 2000;gives a glimpse into the movement of small-cap stocks. And the;Nasdaq-100;- which does include AMZN, FB, and GOOG - is a useful shorthand for understanding the market's sentiment toward tech.;There's another thing those indices all have in common: they are weighted by market cap, not by price. In other words, they cover more stocks in a far more accurate manner.;So if you're wondering whether the Dow will hit 20,000, save the time. There are many more useful indices out there.;As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;Is Apple Inc.

Some Bad News for Apple Inc.;January 10, 2017, 12:00:00 PM EDT;In the fall of 2016,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced its next-generation iPhones, branded   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These phones included a number of   significant enhancements, such as more colorful and   color-accurate displays, faster processors, improved cameras,   stereo speakers, a solid-state home button, and faster wireless   connectivity.;Image source: Apple.;"makeArticleAd();";Indeed, aside from the fact that the look and feel of the   devices were very similar to the prior two generations of iPhone   models, the new devices represented significant upgrades from the   prior-generation devices.;The new iPhone models seemed to be off to a good start, with   Apple CEO Tim Cook saying on an October earnings call that the   company, at the time, had yet to reach supply demand balance for   its new phones.;Nevertheless, a recent report from BlueFin Research Partners,   by way of;Barron's;, says that Apple has yet again cut its iPhone products plans,   suggesting that the new devices might not be able to keep sales   momentum up until the company launches its next-generation   iPhones in the fall.;Slashing estimates some more;BlueFin's initial iPhone unit shipment estimates for the March   quarter sat at 59 million. That figure, if Apple were still on   track to that goal, would have represented solid year-over-year   growth from roughly 51 million units shipped in the March-ending   quarter of the prior year, though still down from the roughly 61   million units that Apple shipped in the March-ending quarter of   its fiscal 2015.;However, the analysts cut their estimates to 53 million last   month, according to;Barron's;, and they're now taking those estimates to just 50 million   units. If the analysts are right, then Apple might be looking at   another -- albeit modest -- year-over-year decline in unit   shipments during the March-ending quarter.;Considering that some of Apple's chief rivals, particularly in   China, are posting substantial year-over-year smartphone unit   growth -- and it's not all happening at the low end of the market   -- it's starting to look as though this product cycle isn't going   to be a particularly good one for Apple, either.;All eyes on the next cycle;Apple may have made a mistake in not significantly changing   the look and feel of the iPhone models that launched in the fall.   There had been;rumors;before the launches of those devices that Apple was looking to   slim down the iPhone models significantly from the ones launched   in the prior two cycles, but this ultimately didn't come to   pass.;Image source: Apple.;Apple is known to test out multiple different potential models   before deciding on the final designs and putting them into mass   production. Perhaps Apple found that it would have had to make   too many technical sacrifices -- perhaps on battery life,   processing power, or something else -- to slim down the phones,   ultimately going with devices with a similar look and feel to the   iPhone 6 series and iPhone 6s series.;"It'll be interesting to see what Apple ultimately launches   later this year, but consumers aren't responding to the numerous   ""under-the-hood"" changes that the company introduced with the   iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 series devices.";A fresh look and feel for its iPhone devices could be just   what Apple needs to get its iPhone business back on a solid   growth path.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Will CES Success Send Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock to $1,000?;January 10, 2017, 11:37:51 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;By all accounts;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) had a fabulous Consumer Electronics Show. According to InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon,;Alexa was the big winner of CES 2017;- an event the company didn't even have its own booth at. The company's Alexa voice assistant could eventually become an;operating system;, showing up last week in refrigerators, cars and robots. But what kind of affect does this have on AMZN stock?;Source: Shutterstock;Amazon's ability to get its assistant supported by hardware contrasted with the failures of Siri from;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;), Cortana from;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;), and Google Assistant from;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOG;, NASDAQ:;GOOGL;).;"makeArticleAd();";Amazon did it, first, by delivering the assistant to millions through its Echo speakers and, second, by allowing it to run on the cheapest imaginable hardware, focusing instead on the cloud-based Alexa Voice Service API. Rivals sought to use their voice assistants to tie hardware to their higher-end ecosystems, and they are unlikely to show much for consumer markets before next year.;AMZN stock had fallen from a high of nearly $850 per share in October to a post-election low of barely $720. To many investors that is starting to look like yet-another missed opportunity to get in.;Spectacular Whispers;"The ""whisper number"" on Amazon's Christmas-season earnings have become outrageous. The latest is for earnings of $1.43 per share on revenues of";$44.70 billion.;Last Christmas, by contrast, Amazon did $1.00 per share of earnings on revenues of $35.747 billion and, after another one of those discouraging falls (this time to near $500), rose steadily to that near-$850 high.;The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017;If AMZN stock matches expectations, you're talking about top-line growth of 25% and earnings growth of 43%, year-over-year. You're still talking about paying nearly three times sale for a retailer, when successful merchants like;Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.;(NYSE:;WMT;) get just 40 cents of equity for each dollar of sales, but Amazon is no longer a retailer.;Since then, of course, AMZN has become a major TV studio, with;the Golden Globes to prove it.;In addition to its $100 per year Prime shipping plan, which includes the video offerings and ties customers to the shopping service with free shipping, Amazon has added $10-per-month plans for music and eBooks - I've lately found the Kindle Unlimited offering to be outstanding.;Its Amazon Web Services cloud is practically an industry standard, and its most recent report showed it growing 55% per year, to;a run rate of over $11 billion;, with high profitability. If Alexa is becoming an operating system, akin to Windows, Android and Apple's iOS, many will consider it highly undervalued.;The Bear Case for AMZN Stock;Every story like this must include a bear case for the stock.;"Back in 2012, when I first started accumulating shares at about $330 each, bears claimed that Amazon didn't make any money, that it was a ""Ponzi scheme"" and, essentially, an over-priced merchandiser.";Just last week,;InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler wrote;that the technicals were bad, that the data collected by the Echo;may become subject to judicial review;and that the incoming Administration doesn't like the company.;Scams are proliferating on the service;and one long-time Amazon bull, Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities, told his followers to dump AMZN stock late last year, saying cloud growth catalysts;are gone;.;I'm Not Selling Amazon Stock;I disagree. AMZN stock has become like Apple, a stock you buy when you can and hold onto. I have more than doubled my money on Amazon stock since 2013, and while it's becoming an uncomfortably large part of my retirement account, I'm going to own it for the long haul.;We are still in the early innings of the cloud revolution, voice operating systems are brand-new and the disruption of cable by internet offerings like;Netflix, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;NFLX;) and Amazon Prime has really just begun.;Should I Buy Amazon (AMZN) Stock? 3 Pros, 3     Cons;AMZN remains hungry, entering;the activewear market;under its own brand,;private labels in food;and geography-specific offerings like a move into;India's big market for second-hand goods.;"Even at its present sales level, Amazon is still less than one-third as large as Walmart, with better penetration of international markets and now it is a true player in the ""great game"" of technology industry leadership.";If I weren't stuffed with AMZN stock (no retirement account should have all its eggs in one basket) I'd be buying more.

5 ETF Investment Ideas for 2017;January 10, 2017, 11:30:00 AM EDT;The year 2017 started on a positive note as investors remain hopeful that Trump's polices will result in faster economic growth and higher interest rates. But many investors now worry that the market could be getting ahead of itself.;It appears that the market has already priced in the best case scenario of growth and inflation, leaving a lot of room for disappointment if things do not go as planned. A surging dollar and rising bond yields could also pose headwinds to the market. The surge in dollar would hurt multinationals that derive a significant portion of their earnings from abroad and high rates impact the economic activity and the housing market. (Read:;10 Predictions for the ETF Industry in 2017;);"At the same time, there are many other factors that could support the rally this year. One of the strongest tailwinds for stocks could emanate from rotation out of bonds. After the great financial crisis, many investors have remained underinvested in stocks, preferring ""safer"" bonds.";These investors missed out on one of the greatest stock rallies in history. Per WSJ, the Dow has returned 274%, including dividends, since bottoming out in 2009, while the 10-year??? Treasury note has returned 33% over the same period. After realizing that the three decade old rally in bonds is over now, these investors could return to stocks.;Earning growth could also add fuel to the rally. After five quarters of earnings recession, S&P 500 companies reported +3.8% growth for Q3.  Per Zacks Earnings Trends, for Q4 as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up +3.1% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. (Read:;4 ETF Areas Likely to Stay Strong in 2017;);Over the past few years, share repurchases have been a major force behind the rally. After slowing down earlier this year thanks mainly to stretched valuations, buybacks picked up again after the presidential election.  Companies are expected to spend more on buybacks with savings from tax cuts and cash repatriated from abroad under the repatriation tax holiday.;According to;Goldman Sachs;, S&P 500 companies will repatriate $200 billion of their $1 trillion in cash held overseas in 2017 and of that $150 billion will be spent on share repurchases.;While financials and industrials ETFs soared after the election, below we have highlighted some ETF areas that are likely to shine in 2017. (Read:;Large Cap Growth ETFs Warming Up This Winter;);Dividend Growth ETFs;As growth and inflation are expected to pick up this year, the Fed is expected to raise rates at least a couple times. High dividend ETFs which have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ultra-low rate environment tend to underperform when rates rise.;On the other hand, dividend growth ETFs that hold companies with solid balance sheets and rising cash flows, outperform in such environment.;Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (;VIG;),;a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy) ETF;,;focuses on high-quality companies with at least ten consecutive years of increasing dividend payments. Expense ratio is just 9 basis points. Top holdings include Microsoft, J&J and Pepsi.;Japan ETFs;The US dollar, which has been rising since the election, should see further gains ahead if the Fed hikes rates aggressively next year. A strong dollar and improving growth in the US benefit Japanese exporters. The Bank of Japan is expected to continue to pursue its ultra-accommodative monetary policy, which will benefit Japanese stocks and weaken the yen.;Further, Japanese stocks look significantly underpriced compared to the US stocks.;WisdomTree Japan ETF (;DXJ;),;currently Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy), provides access to Japanese dividend paying exporters, while hedging out the currency risk. Toyota Motors, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Financial are the top holdings.;Technology ETFs;Technology stocks, except semiconductor stocks, did not participate in the post-election rally thanks to concerns regarding the impact of Trump's trade and immigration policies. But of late, big tech stocks have been rising, particularly after conciliatory meeting between Trump and the tech leaders.;Technology companies tend to do well when the economic growth picks up. Further, they are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of repatriation tax holiday.

McDonald's, Boeing and Qualcomm are the top holdings in this ETF.;Aerospace & Defense ETFs;Aerospace & Defense companies had soared initially after Trump's win on hopes of surge in defense spending under the new admiration. However, after Trump's tweets targeting some of these companies, particularly Boeing and Lockheed Martin, their shares had taken a beating. Looking at the longer-term picture, these companies are worth buying at these prices.;Per WSJ, major defense contractors are likely to benefit from US military's increased spending on precision-guided missiles and bombs in its campaign against the Islamic State in the Middle East.

How GoPro Inc Can Improve “Storytelling” in 2017;January 10, 2017, 11:15:00 AM EDT;GoPro Inc;"(NASDAQ: GPRO) is trying to rebrand itself as a ""mobile   storytelling"" company by building an ecosystem of image capture   and mobile software solutions. It's a good strategy given the   large market share the company has over competitors like";Garmin;(NASDAQ: GRMN) in the action camera marketplace and where its   cameras fit in comparison to;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) smartphones. But there are still flaws in the   strategy heading into 2017.;For as much as GoPro's software has improved in 2016, the   company has a lot of work to do to make a seamless storytelling   solution for customers. Here's how it could take steps to   improving storytelling this year.;Image source: GoPro.;"makeArticleAd();";GoPro's app solutions are too complicated;In the last year, GoPro has improved its editing solutions,   namely by adding the Quik editing app to its product line. But   GoPro users now have to use the Capture app to offload content,   Quick and Splice for editing, and a separate GoPro VR app for   uploading and viewing virtual reality video.;GoPro needs to make this app ecosystem simple and easy to use   for everyone. At the very least, combining Capture, Splice, and   Quick into a single app would be a good move and make it more   attractive to edit content with GoPro's app.;"If a single app were combined with free cloud storage, the   idea of using GoPro for capturing content and using the company's   apps for ""storytelling"" would be easier to sell to customers. And   making using GoPro simple for storytelling will make it more   attractive to customers.";Why is the cloud so expensive?;When GoPro launched GoPro Plus cloud storage solution, it was   aimed at taking away a pain point customers had with their   cameras. Instead of connecting a camera to a computer or phone to   offload images, customers simply needed to plug their camera into   an outlet and images would automatically be uploaded to the   cloud. The problem was, GoPro Plus costs $4.99 per month and is   limited to 35 hours of 1080p videos or 62,500 photos, or a   combination of the two at any time. In addition, videos would be   converted down to 1080p and pictures to 12 MP if they were taken   at higher resolution.;The amount of storage isn't unreasonable for the price. 62,500   12 MP photos would take about 256 GB of storage, and a $4.99 per   month price tag is reasonable if you use the service a lot.   What's missing is the limited amount of free storage that's   become common from competitors.

And   with free options readily available, there's no reason the cloud   will be a big revenue generator for the company. GoPro should   create a tiered pricing strategy for GoPro Plus, with a free   option for users as a perk for buying a camera. That would help   grow usage of the product and keep people in the GoPro ecosystem   for storage solutions. And it would create a better storytelling   experience, which is the goal for GoPro in 2017.;10 stocks we like better than GoPro;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Developing AR Glasses with Carl Zeiss?;January 10, 2017, 10:44:25 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;The 2017 Consumer Electronics Show may have wound down, but the rumors around it certainly haven't. The latest is centered on;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;), a company that wasn't even;at;CES 2017. A well-known technology blogger is convinced he uncovered a partnership between AAPL and German optical company;Carl Zeiss AG;to develop Apple AR glasses. And he thinks they'll be released in 2017.;Source: Twitter;The new rumor about Apple AR glasses started when technology blogger;Robert Scoble wrote a post;on Facebook. In it, he laid out a series of clues that led him to conclude that something is up between Apple and Carl Zeiss AG.;"makeArticleAd();";CES 2017, Carl Zeiss AG and Augmented Reality;He started with a photo showing Carl Zeiss AG clearly had a booth located in the Augmented Reality section of CES 2017. However, the company had no AR technology on display, which was odd. Scoble approached the staff operating the booth and asked them if the lack of product was because Tim Cook had refused to allow them to show it and got a nervous reaction that seemed to confirm his suspicions. He went on to write:;"""A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.""";If Scoble is correct in his prediction, AAPL could be adding Apple AR glasses to a big product release year that includes a 10th anniversary iPhone 8.;Apple AR Glasses Are Far From a Long Shot;What Scoble wrote is a rumor.

Both have been very popular and show that AR is likely to hit the mainstream before virtual reality does.;AAPL has already publicly supported the concept of augmented reality multiple times in recent months. In a July earnings meeting,;CEO Tim Cook said;:;"""AR can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We're high on AR in the long run and we think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.""";And;in September, Cook was quoted;by;Business Insider;as saying:;"""There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality - both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.""";Clearly, Cook has been giving more than passing thought to augmented reality and in the quest to create a new, high-demand product line, Apple AR glasses could fit the bill.

The;S&P 500 Index;lost 0.4%, and the;Dow Jones Industrial Average;slipped 0.4%. However, the;Nasdaq Composite;was able to finish 0.2% higher by day's end, shrugging off weakness in the other major indices yet again.;"makeArticleAd();";As we head into Tuesday's trading, the focus shifts to a few companies, including;Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.;(NYSE:CMG),;Barracuda Networks Inc;(NYSE:;CUDA;) and;WD-40 Company;(NASDAQ:;WDFC;).;Here's what you should know:;Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

October comps were down 20%, but November's comps decline was far less drastic, and favorable comparisons helped Chipotle earn a nearly 15% improvement in the metric.;Chipotle also said sales for the quarter came to $1.04 billion - slightly higher year-over-year, but about $10 million short of estimates. Its earnings forecast was even worse, with a range of 50-58 cents per share coming in well under expectations of 96 cents.;10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It;Still, the news was good relative to some of the ugly metrics Chipotle has been spewing in recent quarters, and investors bid up CMG stock by more than 4% at the open.;Barracuda Networks Inc (CUDA);CUDA shares were up decently on Tuesday morning after the cloud computing company posted fiscal third-quarter earnings.;Barracuda Networks;earned 22 cents per share;", easily beating expectations of 14 cents.

2 Critical Performance Targets That Apple, Inc. Missed Last Fiscal Year;January 10, 2017, 09:47:00 AM EDT;CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.;Ahead of its annual shareholder meeting at the end of next   month,;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) has gone ahead and filed its;proxy statement;with the SEC. As usual for proxy statements, Apple is disclosing   executive compensation levels for its most prominent executives,   along with how it arrives at those levels. Following a relatively   tough 2016 that included the first ever decline in iPhone unit   sales, all executives including CEO Tim Cook saw pay reductions   last year.;"makeArticleAd();";Apple's compensation committee sets out two critical   performance targets each year to gauge the company's performance,   and Apple fell short for 2016.;Top line and the almost-bottom line;More specifically, the two targets relate to top-line revenue   and operating income, which is right above the bottom line before   miscellaneous income and expenses as well as taxes are taken out.   For each metric, Apple sets a threshold goal that must be   exceeded for executives to receive their annual cash incentives.   At that threshold, the cash bonus is equal to 100% of their   respective base salaries. There is also a target goal that earns   them 200% payouts, as well as a maximum goal that triggers a   generous 400% payout.;Both revenue and operating income hit their threshold goals,   but fell short of target goals. In the case of operating income,   Apple only barely fell short. The company generated revenue of   $215.6 billion in fiscal 2016, compared to the target goal of   $223.6 billion. Operating income came in at $60 billion, just a   hair shy of the target goal of $60.3 billion.;Image source: 2016 proxy statement.;For context, Apple utterly hit it out of the park in 2015,   exceeding its maximum goals for both metrics -- triggering those   hefty 400% payouts in the process.;Fiscal 2015 Performance;Revenue;Operating Income;Threshold Goal;$188 billion;$52.5 billion;Target Goal;$199 billion;$55.1 billion;Maximum Goal;$210 billion;$56.3 billion;Actual;$233.7 billion;$71.2 billion;Data source: 2015 proxy statement.;However, keep in mind that Cook got a $1 million raise to $3   million last year in terms of his base salary, which represented   a 50% boost from 2015. That certainly softened the blow a bit.   All told, Cook brought home $8.7 million last year, down from   $10.3 million in 2015. The rest of the executive team's base   salaries remained unchanged at a cool $1 million per year,   although they all received $20 million equity grants in October   2015 (which is part of fiscal 2016).;It's all relative;Many of the equity grants that Apple executives receive are   performance-based, being tied to how Apple shares perform   relative to the;S&P 500;. This is measured in relative total stock return (TSR).;In a shareholder-friendly move a couple years ago, Cook chose   to voluntarily modify his 2011 CEO grant to swap out time-based   shares for performance-based RSUs. A year ago, I noted that Cook   was facing a deadline in August 2016 and had;a lot to lose;if Apple continued to lag the broader market. Fortunately for   Cook, shares bounced back and Apple's relative TSR scored well   enough (78th percentile) for 280,000 RSUs to vest, the maximum   allowed.;For the rest of the executive team and their October 2015   grants, here are the necessary relative TSR tiers and respective   payouts.;Relative TSR vs. S&P 500 Companies;Performance-based RSU Vesting as % of             Target;85th or above;200%;55th;100%;25th;25%;Below 25th;0%;Data source: 2016 proxy statement.;As of the beginning of 2017, three executives had shares vest   after Apple's relative TSR ranked it in the 83rd percentile.;Overall, Apple's compensation practices are quite aligned with   shareholder interests. Not only does management have to deliver   on fundamental performance, but Apple shares also need to fare   well in order for executives to claim all of their eligible   performance-based RSU grants.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: NVIDIA, Intel, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco and IBM;January 10, 2017, 09:30:00 AM EDT;For Immediate Release;Chicago, IL - January 10, 2017 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry: Semiconductors, including;NVIDIA;(;NVDA;-;Free Report;),;Intel;(NASDAQ:;INTC;-;Free Report;),;Facebook;(NASDAQ:;FB;-;Free Report;),;Apple;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;-;Free Report;),;Microsoft;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;-;Free Report;),;Cisco;(NASDAQ:;CSCO;-;Free Report;) and;IBM;(NYSE:;IBM;-;Free Report;).;Industry: Semiconductors;Link:;https://www.zacks.com/commentary/100510/semiconductor-industry-outlook---january-2017;This section can be divided into the current and emerging drivers. But before getting into that, it's important to understand the backdrop. This includes a shrinking traditional market (mainly PCs) that still consumes the bulk of chips as well as several emerging categories that have extremely strong growth potential. This means that while the industry as a whole may appear sluggish, there are solid opportunities waiting to be picked.;Current Drivers;As far as current drivers are concerned, the most significant are cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence that are increasing demand for;servers and data centers;exponentially. Intel and NVIDIA (;NVDA;-;Free Report;) are the strongest positioned here, with Intel's strength mainly on the enterprise side and NVIDIA's on the HPC side. Intel (NASDAQ:;INTC;-;Free Report;) is trying to dislodge NVIDIA, but that is easier said than done. HPC is where a lot of the innovation is going on and NVIDIA is set to pick up share of spending because of its lead in machine learning.;Some disruption is afoot in the enterprise segment as well because of the work done by the Open Compute Project (OCP) that Facebook (NASDAQ:;FB;-;Free Report;) founded and continues to feed. The social networking company generates huge volumes of data that it needs to store, manage and process as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible. Others with similar interest, like Apple (NASDAQ:;AAPL;-;Free Report;) , Microsoft (NASDAQ:;MSFT;-;Free Report;) and Google, and differing interest like Intel, HP, Cisco (NASDAQ:;CSCO;-;Free Report;) and Juniper are also part of the project.;Facebook designs the chip that is then optimized by the OCP so it becomes something members can standardize on. So far so good. But if the OCP is able to design chips that perform better or comparably with Intel chips, the chip maker's cloud business can be hurt. This explains why Intel is part of the effort.;But Intel has other challengers, too. Google seems to be testing out IBM's (NYSE:;IBM;-;Free Report;) new chip designs. It is reportedly the only top chip buyer that doesn't sell servers but instead builds them for internal use. And the company is now also seeking growth in the IaaS segment. Therefore, Google's decisions are extremely significant in the chip consumption context.;Google has done two things in the recent past that could be viewed as second sourcing or maybe creating leverage against Intel to pressure it into lowering prices. The company has declared that everything it now does also supports IBM's Power systems and it is also in talks with Qualcomm that could result in its using some of its ARM-based server chips.;Amazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure followed by Microsoft, IBM and Google. This is another chip-hungry segment with long-term demand for the devices. This is perhaps the reason that some time back, Amazon started dabbling with low-end ARM-chips. The company looks interested in making its own devices, but it's still too early to comment on its progress.;Intel's only course of action is to innovate around the problem (increasing performance while reducing cost per watt is a way it could do this). After all, it's hard to convince people that you deserve to make a nice margin. Another significant development is Intel's decision to license ARM technology perhaps to support its foundry business, or help it speed up its IoT effort, or maybe even to use in some segments of the cloud computing market.;Microsoft seems allied with Intel for now, although we don't know how that story will play out since it's also a member of the OCP.;Another important segment for semiconductor companies that is relatively low-key is;Industrial;. Since semiconductors facilitate increased automation on the factory floor, they are increasingly used to drive efficiency and lower cost. Reportedly, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) expects the industrial semiconductor market to grow at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 9.7% between 2014 and 2019. A Global Industry Analysts (GIA) report says that the U.S. is the largest market for industrial semiconductors although the Asia/Pacific is the fastest growing on account of its being a manufacturing hub. The overall market is expected to be worth $60 billion by 2022.;IC Insights estimates that global;medical;semiconductor sales will grow at a 12.3% CAGR to reach $8.2 billion in 2018. It's not clear if this estimate includes wearables that are normally considered IoT and therefore included in consumer. Wearables carry an increasing amount of medical information and consume a good number of semiconductor devices. Databeans attributes continued strength in this vertical to the need to reduce healthcare cost (expected to double from the current $2.5 trillion over the next few years), the need to extend healthcare to underserved areas and convenience/the need to improve overall disease management from the comfort of your own home.;One of the fastest-growing emerging markets for semiconductor devices is;automotive;, as the consumption of electronic components for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase. A recent report from MarketsandMarkets says that the automotive semiconductor market will grow at a CAGR of 5.8% from 2016 through 2022. Power components like MOSFET and IGBT devices are some of the fastest growing because of the increased electrification of vehicles.;The growing middle class in several Asian markets like China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia is greatly increasing the demand for passenger cars thus accounting for most of the semiconductor shipments into the automotive market. Semiconductor consumption in this market was worth around $7 billion in 2015, according to Reportlinker. Primary areas of strength were hybrid electric vehicles, telematics and connectivity, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), where the estimated 5-year CAGRs for chip demand are 20%, 19% and 18%, respectively. Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Renesas, Freescale, Texas Instruments and Spansion (owned by Cypress) are major players.;Similar to medical devices, the auto market also has an emerging adjacent market in the form of autonomous/self-driving cars that will consume a huge number of semiconductors, particularly the sensors, processors and other technology enabling the vehicles.;Wireless infrastructure;builds have been necessitated by increasing data volumes and connectivity issues (network congestion, power reliability, privacy and security) in wireless networks. These builds will require increased investment in semiconductors thus driving sales. New materials are being used in this segment with Galium Nitride gaining share of RF high-power semiconductors, according to ABI Research.;The;PC market;still consumes a large number of chips but its importance as a driver continues to decline. That's because the market itself is shrinking (Gartner estimates that it declined 5.7% in the third quarter while IDC estimates that it declined 3.9%). IDC believes that North America grew for the second straight quarter while Gartner says that sales were consistent with year-ago periods. Both agree on declines in the Asia/Pacific.;Consumers are hesitant to spend on upgrades given that they already have many more devices than they need (developed markets) and because Internet and many other conveniences of computers are now easily available on smartphones and tablets (emerging markets). But gaming enthusiasts demand stronger and faster machines, which is the main driver of PC sales and chips right now.;In either case, it's very clear that the steady growth seen in yesteryears is history. IDC for one expects the PC market to shrink 7.2% this year and 2.1% in 2017. So semiconductor players with PC market exposure can at best profit from market share gains, BYOD exposure and increased exposure to the top PC vendors, which are Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus and Apple according to both IDC and Gartner.;Apple makes its own PCs, software and also a lot of its own chips, relying largely on Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung for its other semiconductor requirements. Microsoft makes software and limited quantities of hardware, relying largely on third-party device makers for chips, PCs and mobile devices. It's also a major player in the cloud, which makes it an important ally for semiconductor companies like Intel or NVIDIA. Alphabet's chromebooks, on the other hand, are made by a number of hardware makers that use either Intel or ARM technology.;Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News;"Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" were generated by the stock-picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Walt Disney Co (DIS) and Ford Motor Company (F);January 10, 2017, 09:26:08 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;U.S. stock futures are hovering around breakeven this morning, as Wall Street debates its options ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's first press conference since July. Investors are growing concerned about the content of today's press conference, prompting the;Dow Jones Industrial Average t;o retreat further from the much-anticipated 20,000 level yesterday.;"makeArticleAd();";Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are off 0.1%,;S&P 500;futures have dipped 0.03% and;Nasdaq-100;futures have edged 0.02% lower.;On the options front, volume arrived below average on Monday, as only about 12.4 million calls and 10.3 million puts traded yesterday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio whipsawed to a one-week low of 0.62, though the 10-day moving average held pat at 0.66.;Turning to Monday's volume leaders,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;") option volume jumped after Morgan Stanley named the company a ""top pick"" for 2017, while";Walt Disney Co's;(NYSE:;DIS;") ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" topped the box office for the fourth straight week - attracting heavy call volume. Finally,";Ford Motor Company;(NYSE:;F;) unveiled both new and old offerings at the Detroit Auto Show this week to a mixed reception.;Apple Inc. (AAPL);AAPL stock broke out above its October highs in the $118 region yesterday, riding high on the latest round of bullish comments out of Morgan Stanley. On Friday last week,;"Morgan Stanley named Apple a ""top pick""";based on pent-up demand for the iPhone and potential incoming tax breaks from President-elect Donald Trump.;10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It;The Trump reasoning is well known, with the incoming President expected to slash corporate tax rates and offer incentives for companies to bring home hoards of cash stored overseas. But the pent-up iPhone demand is based on slow consumer uptake of the iPhone 7 due to lack of impressive design and features.;Morgan Stanley believes the iPhone 8 will remedy that situation.;Options traders were quick to jump on AAPL calls Monday morning. More than one million contracts traded on AAPL stock, with calls snapping up 67% of the day's take - well above average for the shares. Looking out to January 2017, AAPL is trading north of peak call and put open interest at the $115 strike, but more than 171,000 calls still reside overhead at the $120 strike. With the right tailwind, AAPL has a shot at besting this hurdle, which could give rise to another bull run for the shares.;Walt Disney Co. (DIS);"The Force is strong with ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."" Disney's blockbuster new Star Wars movie has topped the box office for the";fourth-straight week in a row;". However, analysts noted that the film brought in only $31 million in its Chinese debut, well short of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" total of $53 million.";On another note, analysts at;RBC Capital Markets upgraded Disney stock;"from ""sector perform"" to ""outperform"" on Friday, providing additional lift for the shares.";DIS options traders piled into calls on Monday, with the typically bullish bets making up 77% of the more than 190,000 contracts traded yesterday. A good portion of this call volume was made up by a 20,000-unit calendar spread at the Feb. $110 and June $120 strikes. According to;Trade-Alert.com;, a trader purchased the June $120 calls for $1.63 and sold the Feb $110 calls for $2.32 for a net credit of 69 cents, or $69 per contract.;The trade is a play off falling implieds, where the price of the Feb. option is expected to decline faster than those on the June option. It can also profit if DIS holds below $110 through Feb. expiration, and then rallies through the summer.;Ford Motor Company (F);The Detroit Auto Show is in full swing, placing automakers front and center on Wall Street. Ford took the opportunity to announce that both the Bronco SUV and Ranger light pickup truck were making comebacks in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Ford also said that it was focusing heavily on electric and autonomous vehicles, which it touted as being as significant as the invention of the assembly line.;Trade Apple Inc.

3 Reasons Square Inc (SQ) Stock Is Prime Buyout Bait;January 10, 2017, 09:06:37 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Since it's IPO back in late 2015,;Square Inc;(NYSE:;SQ;) has had a rocky ride, but this has been the case with many newfangled offerings. Over the past year, SQ stock has still been able to log a return of 33%.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified);"It certainly helps that the company has garnered support from Wall Street analysts. For example, Nomura has recently initiated coverage on Square stock, with a ""buy"" rating and a $17 price target.";But going forward, the real play for SQ stock is probably the buyout potential. Let's face it, dealmaking has been heated during the past year.;With that in mind, what are the main reasons Square stock is so attractive?;SQ Stock M&A Reason No.1: Powerful Brand and Platform;Timing was spot-on for SQ. Keep in mind that the company launched in early 2009 when;Apple Inc.'s;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) iPhone revolution was still in the early stages.;7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017;The breakthrough innovation, though, for Square was its reader. Attached to an iPhone, it allowed for the swiping of credit and debit cards. In other words, a merchant could do business anywhere or anytime.;And yes, growth was certainly strong. It was also important that one of the co-founders was Jack Dorsey - who also created;Twitter Inc;(NYSE:;TWTR;) - who leveraged his innate product capabilities.;So over the years, the pace of innovation has not slowed down. To this end, SQ has introduced features like one-or-two day deposits, analytics, inventory management, gift cards and invoicing. There is even a loan program for customers.;In the latest quarter, the revenues for Square jumped by 32% to;$439 million;and the loss came to a manageable 9 cents a share. There was also a 39% increase in transaction volume to $13.2 billion.;This was a pretty good performance since;Starbucks Corporation;(NASDAQ:;SBUX;) - a major customer of SQ - has been transiting to its own payment system.;SQ Stock M&A Reason No.2: Mobile Megatrend;The smartphone is rapidly becoming the virtual wallet for consumers. No doubt, this was evident during the holiday shopping season. On Cyber Monday, mobile commerce sales came to;$1.19 billion;, up 48% on a year-over-year basis.;Yes, growth seems like a good bet for the top players in the mobile commerce space. In fact, according to analysts from Instinet's Dan Dolev, he forecasts that Squares's transaction volume will hit a hefty;$105 billion by 2020;. As a result, he has a price target on SQ stock of $18.;Square Inc (SQ) Stock Finally Catches a Tailwind;It's important to note that the company is still primarily in a small number of countries, such as Canada, Japan and Australia. In other words, there is tremendous potential for overseas expansion, which should help propel the growth for the long haul.;SQ Stock M&A Reason No.3: Many Mega Suitors;But when it comes to M&A, valuation is not necessarily the key factor. Instead, a suitor will often be willing to pay a premium for a company that has major strategic capabilities, such as a strong brand, sophisticated technologies or network effects. This is why;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) was willing to shell out $26.2 billion for LinkedIn.;As for Square, it also has lots of strategic value. Let's face it, the company has a powerful brand in the mobile commerce space as well as a top-notch platform.;And finally, there are no shortage of suitors that can pay top dollar for SQ, like;Alphabet Inc;(NASDAQ:;GOOGL;, NASDAQ:;GOOG;),;Amazon.com, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;), MSFT and AAPL, just to name a few.;Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog;IPO Playbook;and is a registered investment adviser representative (you can;visit his site;to learn more about his financial planning services).;He is also the author of various books on investing like All About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO Strategies.;Follow him on Twitter at;@ttaulli;.

Trade Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock for 150% Upside;January 10, 2017, 08:56:58 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Investors enthusiastically supported a brokerage call on;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) Monday. But is AAPL stock still a buy? Today, we're going to look at Apple both on and off the chart, then present a trade idea based on the current evidence.;"makeArticleAd();";Source:;Yuanbin Du Via Flickr;Morgan Stanley came out yesterday with a bullish call for AAPL stock as the tech giant celebrated its 10-year iPhone anniversary. The firm announced;Apple is a top pick for 2017;", citing an upbeat appraisal of the China-driven ""iPhone supercycle,"" as well as potential favorable tax and cash repatriation reforms.";"If it sounds familiar, it's likely because there's nothing new under the sun regarding Morgan's take on Apple. As well, the call on Apple stock was a reiteration of an ""Overweight"" rating accompanied by a price target of $148 - about 25% higher from here.";AAPL shares did manage to finish up fractionally while the S&P 500 closed down by 0.3%. But 10 years into the wildly successful and game-changing iPhone product, Apple is facing challenges - beginning with getting China to help maintain that iPhone supercycle.;For its part, Morgan Stanley is hopeful that pent-up demand in China is there following lackluster iPhone 7 sales, and will be unleashed if the iPhone 8 is far enough along the cutting edge.;The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' Picks;But maybe more immediately pressing for AAPL stock is President-elect Donald Trump's well-publicized trade rhetoric. If campaign bluster escalates into a tit-for-tat situation, the success Apple enjoys as both a manufacturer and popular brand in China could be at risk, regardless of any new iPhone bells and whistles.;Respected Apple and former Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Muster recently noted the company's size and maturity as headwinds. He emphasized Apple's need to continue transitioning into a software services company to grow revenues, margins and;"""truly evolve.""";AAPL has its work cut out for it, and it will need some extraneous market favor to help grow its business. But those stars could align. And, if Apple's stock chart is any indication, AAPL indeed could be up to the challenge.;AAPL Stock Chart;Click to Enlarge;Less than a month ago, my bias was for lower prices as Apple neared a gap fill in an overbought condition. But that's no longer the case.;Aside from the 0.9% gain notched in Monday's session, shares of Apple have broken marginally above pattern resistance from October, while hitting levels last seen in December 2015.;The breakout in AAPL stock is from a cup-and-handle pattern. The price action is bullish, but a failure in the coming days could always result in a variation of a bearish double-top.;Having said that, Apple isn't overbought, and it has cleared key 62% retracement resistance dating back to its all-time highs in 2015.;The path of least resistance appears to be up.;How to Trade AAPL Stock Now;Looking forward, Morgan Stanley's $148 price target is still a ways from coming into play. But, with 2015's all-time-high 100% retracement level of $134.54 and earnings on the horizon, Apple looks ripe for upside.;Right now, I'm looking for an intermediate-term bullish options spread.;How to Trade Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) Stock AFTER Earnings;Reviewing the board, the AAPL Apr $120/$125 bull call spread is attractive as a more conservative play. Priced for $2 with shares near $119, the vertical can capture 150% (or $3) in profit if Apple stock can gain about 5% by April expiration.;If AAPL remains below the bought $120 call, the spread will eventually collapse from $2 to zero.;Given a holding period in excess of three months, less than 2% equivalent risk and less than 50% of the risk associated with an outright call, this is the best trade you can make on AAPL stock right now.;"Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

The Mesa manufacturing facility was set up by Apple in 2013 and was leased to a supplier to manufacture sapphire screen covers. However, after the supplier went bankrupt, Apple pumped additional capital of $2 billion to convert the facility into to a Global Command Center, powered entirely by green energy, to store data from iTunes and iCloud, further adds the report.";Apple Inc. Price;Apple Inc. Price;|;Apple Inc. Quote;Analysts note that that tech companies usually do not have manufacturing operations in the U.S because of higher labor costs involved than other regions like South East Asia. Apple has been subject to intense focus of President-elect Donald Trump regarding this issue.;"Throughout his campaign, Trump has been opposed to Apple's decision to manufacture goods overseas and had even promised that he will urge Apple to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country. Trump was quoted speaking to The New York Times in Nov 2016, ""One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.""";In fact, to alleviate Apple's concern of increased prices of finished products, Trump has told the company's CEO Tim Cook that he will provide tech companies huge tax cuts.;At present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Apple's shares have marginally outperformed as the broader market over the past one year.

That's on top of whatever gains in graphics and media   capabilities that come with these chips.;Image source: Intel.;Why Apple should update the systems ASAP;Although Apple does have the benefit of being the sole vendor   of macOS-based computers, meaning that customers who want to buy   computers that run macOS have no choice but to buy Apple's   computers, there's little reason for the company to put itself at   a competitive disadvantage relative to its Windows-based   competitors.;Apple's Macs are generally competitive, well-built devices,   boasting best-in-class components in areas such as track-pads,   displays, keyboards, wireless connectivity, and industrial   design.;However, I believe that Apple's MacBook product lines would be   stronger if the company were quicker to adopt Intel's latest   processors. Doing so might mean Apple pays a little bit more for   processors (though I can't imagine the premium is significant),   but a modest bill-of-materials increase is probably worth it, as   the latest processors give Apple an additional marketing point   and its competitors one less potential advantage.;10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

HP Inc (HPQ) Introduces Multiple Products at CES, Las Vegas;January 09, 2017, 06:22:00 PM EDT;Technology giant;HP Inc.;HPQ;ushered in the New Year with the launch of latest ultrabooks, PCs and notebooks at CES 2017. It is an annual technology tradeshow conducted by the Consumer Technology Association every year in January in Las Vegas. The latest additions will provide faster web access, have increased durability and larger displays.;The company's latest offering includes the Spectre 13 - the thinnest and most powerful iteration of laptops - that are anticipated to enhance the web experience and provide high-quality visuals. Powered by Intel Inc.'s;INTC;i5 or i7 processors, the ultra-portable gadget is expected to improve user experience through better connectivity.;The ultrabook has huge file storage capacity with solid state drive options and provides 3D graphics. It has been designed to make data center handling simpler, more flexible, efficient and cost effective. Though the ultrabook is a high-end product, it is suitable for both consumer and corporate purposes. HP's Spectre 13 could challenge Apple's;AAPL;laptop in the rapidly growing market for ultra-portable computers. The new Ultrabook runs on Microsoft Corp.'s;MSFT;Windows 10.;Other Launches at the Event;Notably, the company rolled out five new products last week at CES 2017. The offerings include the HP EliteBook x360, Spectre x360, ENVY Curved All-in-One 34, Sprout Pro and OMEN X 35 Curved Display that has a high-definition (HD) screen which can be easily connected to other devices. The company claims that these products are the world's slimmest full performance notebook PCs, which are likely to offer the ideal combination of enhanced performance, mobility and price.;HP Elite products cater to the current demand for ultra-thin, ultra-light, power efficient mobile products that are suitable for a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) environment. Hence, these products should help the company hold its own in the sluggish PC market.;The slimmest among the Elite family, the models will be available from January. These products will enhance web experience and provide high-quality visuals. Moreover, the new line-up will add variety and functionality to some older notebooks and desktops, which in turn, will attract new clients.;Conclusion;HP's efforts to turn around the business have been commendable. The company has adopted a strategy of engaging in product innovations and differentiation as well as enhancing the printing business' capabilities to stabilize the top line.;Furthermore, looking at the data compiled by two independent research firms - Gartner and International Data Corporation - we believe that the downtrend in PC shipments moderated in third-quarter 2016, compared with the previous quarters.;Notably, for HP, this was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. The company witnessed a 2.3% increase in PC shipments. We believe that the spin-off from Hewlett-Packard Company and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and job cuts to lower costs, are finally paying off.;The stock has gained approximately 40.8% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized;Computer-Mini Computers;industry's return of 20.7%.;Currently, HP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

IBM Is Betting Its Future on AI;January 09, 2017, 06:13:00 PM EDT;Investors haven't been happy with;IBM;(NYSE: IBM) lately. Since Ginni Rometty started as CEO in January   of 2012, IBM has had 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year   declining revenue -- essentially every quarter of her   tenure. The stock has lost nearly 10% compared with a gain of 78%   for the;S&P 500;over the last five years.;"makeArticleAd();";IBM 5 Year Price Returns (Daily);data by;YCharts;.;Consider this;criticism;of Rometty's record from the;Los Angeles Times;:;For IBM shareholders, Ginni Rometty's four-year reign as     chief executive officer hasn't been anything to go to     Disneyland about. But her company has become a leader in one     corporate category: board members willing to shovel incentive     pay at a CEO turning in a mediocre performance.;With all the negative sentiment and equally dismal stock   performance, should investors have any hope that IBM will right   the ship?;IBM believes it can, and it's betting the future on Watson.   You may recall how Ken Jennings, famous for his 74 consecutive   wins on Jeopardy, was dethroned by Watson, the IBM supercomputer.   Why would a company risk so much on a game-playing computer? The   key is not in the computer as much as in the science behind   it.;IBM's Watson beats 74-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings.    Image source: Flickr user;edwardhblake;.;Watson is a system based on artificial intelligence (AI).   Computer simulations of the human brain, called neural networks,   mimic humans' capacity to learn. Using massive amounts of data   and complex algorithms, an AI system gradually learns to   recognize similarities and distinguish differences. It is taught   to recognize patterns within massive amounts of data.;IBM has been betting heavily on Watson by leveraging its AI   platform and data analytics for a variety of business   applications. The company's CEO has said that, in the next five   years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be   made with the help of Watson. Several recent high-profile   partnerships illustrate how IBM has been approaching this goal,   and the strategy appears to be gaining steam.;Born to run;UA Record smartphone app powers Healthbox.         Image source: Under Armour.;Under Armour;(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) announced a strategic partnership with IBM   to leverage the 190 million registered users of its Connected   Fitness platform and Watson's deep-learning technology. The   system would provide users with individual health and fitness   insights backed by data. It is intended to act as a personal   health consultant, fitness trainer, and assistant.;This collaboration underpins the HealthBox, Under Armour's   connected fitness system, which combines a fitness band, digital   scale, heart-rate monitor, and the UA Record smartphone app. It   will track sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, and training   information, and provide personalized recommendations. This is a   valuable project for IBM since Watson learns with each infusion   of data.;The partnership is a win for Under Armour as well, and is part   of a bigger play. Its acquisition of three fitness app companies   that now comprise its Connected Fitness platform, the release of   Healthbox, and the integration of Watson provides Under Armour   with an end-to-end health and fitness solution that connects to   its users in a very real way. This will likely drive future   adoption and boost customer satisfaction.;Not a drive-by;OnStar Go powered by Watson. Image source: General Motors     Company.;General Motors Company;(NYSE: GM) partnered with IBM to pair its OnStar   vehicle-communication system with Watson's learning capabilities   to create OnStar Go, a cognitive mobility platform. According to   the;press release;, the new platform's numerous benefits include helping drivers   avoid traffic, giving them the ability to order coffee on the go,   making restaurant recommendations, and reminding users to pick up   diapers and formula on the way home.;Drivers will have to consent, and Watson will recognize their   preferences and patterns in their decisions and habits. This will   also develop individualized and location-based marketing. The   partnership will present other business opportunities. OnStar has   already signed iHeartRadio, which will provide personalized   musical experiences, and;MasterCard;, which will allow consumers to pay for gas and other services   from their car. Other partners include;ExxonMobil;, Glympse, and Parkopedia.;Looks like an Apple core;iOS enterprise developers get access to Watson. Image     source: IBM.;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) and IBM's partnership was first announced over two   years ago but has evolved in the meantime. Initially, the pair   planned the development of over 100 enterprise apps for a variety   of industries, including retail, healthcare, banking,   transportation, and insurance. According to a recent   announcement, enterprise iOS users will have in-app access to   Watson, opening the door to deep-learning technology for these   made-for-business apps. iOS app developers will be able to use   Watson's AI as a platform for their own apps.;Apple has already benefited from the partnership by gaining   inroads into enterprise. IBM announced last year that it had   begun to replace its PCs with Apple Mac computers. Employees were   given the option to make the switch and 73% chose Mac. In a   presentation at Jamf Nation User Conference, a gathering of Mac   system administrators, IBM told attendees that PCs were three   times more expensive to manage, Macs had a lower total cost of   ownership, and that the Mac was the standard at IBM Japan -- PCs   were the exception.;These recent developments will provide greater validation to   Apple's prospective enterprise customers while advancing the   company's AI agenda. Apple has an installed base of over 1   billion active iOS devices with a growing percentage of those in   enterprise. This, combined with Watson's ability to learn from   streams of data, will provide both companies with a stronger   relative position from which to compete.;The Foolish final word;These collaborations are merely the most high-profile examples   of hundreds going on behind the scenes. IBM tweeted earlier this   year that more than 500 partners and 80,000 developers were   building products and apps powered by Watson. The installed base   that comes with the partnerships is growing, and should   eventually show up in IBM's revenue and provide vindication for   the company's Watson-centric strategy.;IBM expects Watson to contribute $1 billion in revenue by   2018, and $10 billion by 2023, though it doesn't currently break   out that contribution. Strategic Initiatives, where Watson's   revenue resides was $8 billion in the most recent quarter, of $19   billion total revenue for IBM. It's a relatively small slice for   IBM now, but it's clear the company expects to build AI into a   major pillar of its business in the next few years. If it works,   it might just reverse fortunes for the flailing big tech   company.;10 stocks we like better than IBM;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

10 Charts to Celebrate the iPhone's 10th Birthday;January 09, 2017, 03:53:00 PM EDT;CEO Tim Cook holds the billionth iPhone at an employee     meeting in Cupertino. Image source: Apple.;Ten years ago today, Steve Jobs introduced the product that     would reshape not only;Apple;"(NASDAQ: AAPL) , but also the world. That Macworld presentation     will always be considered Jobs' greatest product introduction     ever. In what now seems like common sense, Jobs noted that     dynamic virtual buttons on a capacitive touchscreen enable     endless flexibility and interface innovation, while ""the bottom     40 [percent]"" of all prior phones were occupied by physical     buttons. Note that Apple wouldn't actually launch the device     until June 2007, a rare instance of the company preannouncing a     product.";"makeArticleAd();";A decade ago, mobile computing meant carrying your laptop     around with you and hoping to find a Wi-Fi hotspot. Nowadays,     it means having any number of cellular-equipped mobile devices     always within reach, be it a smartphone or tablet. Apple's     turnaround had already taken shape circa 2006, and the company     was on firm financial footing thanks to the iPod's success, but     the iPhone catapulted Apple to becoming the world's most     valuable company.;Here are 10 charts to celebrate the iPhone's 10th     birthday.;1. Rising unit sales;Last year marked the first time that Apple posted a     year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales. While the initial     investor reaction was to fret, it's worth taking a moment to     appreciate the incredible run.;Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.;2. A billion and counting;Over the summer of 2016, Apple sold its billionth iPhone.     Apple hosted an employee meeting to display the billionth unit     (pictured above). Here's how it got there.;Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.;3. Soaring market capitalization;I personally purchased shares of Apple for the first time in     2006, in July of that year for $60.83 (pre-split). Needless to     say, buying Apple the year before the launch of the iPhone has     been quite an investment. Shares are up 800% since the day of     the unveiling.;AAPL;data by;YCharts;.;4. The rise of the smartphone user;Before the iPhone, smartphones were a luxury relegated to     the enterprise or high-end power users. The iPhone made     smartphones approachable and easy to use, spurring mainstream     consumer adoption. There are now over 2.5 billion smartphone     users worldwide, according to KPCB's Mary Meeker.;Image source: KPCB Internet Trends 2016.;5. The iPhone alone would be No. 12 on the Fortune 500;"The next few don't go as far back, since Apple has changed     its financial reporting a couple of times over the years (which     breaks financial continuity). On a trailing-12-month basis, the     iPhone became a $150 billion business in 2015. With the iPhone     stalling in 2016, this figure has come down to ""just"" $137     billion. (The iPhone alone would rank as No. 12 on the Fortune     500.) Compare that to the $2.5 billion in revenue that the     iPhone generated in its first year on the market (although     Apple was required to account for iPhone sales under     subscription accounting back then, stretching out revenue     recognition).";Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.;6. iPhone is over 60% of sales;It's common knowledge at this point that the iPhone is     Apple's most important product by far, generating over 60% of     sales. This proportion has also risen precipitously over the     years, and is currently around 63% on a trailing-12-month     basis. In its first year, the iPhone accounted for 8% of sales     (same caveat about subscription accounting).;Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown. TTM = trailing 12 months.;7. Apple hogs all the profits;A couple of months ago, Strategy Analytics estimated that     the smartphone industry collectively generated $9.4 billion in     operating profits in the third quarter. Of that pie, Apple     bagged a staggering 91% of the industry's profit, thanks     largely to its superior pricing power. It also helps that     Apple's scale affords it better leverage when negotiating     component pricing, helping to reduce costs. Other estimates     actually peg Apple's proportion of industry profits at over     100%, since most other companies' smartphone operations only     generate losses.;Data source: Strategy Analytics. Chart by author.;8. Pricing remains strong;Speaking of superior pricing power, Apple has a unique     ability within the smartphone industry to price at a premium     with little pressure to reduce prices. Average selling prices     (ASPs) are generally resilient (albeit with natural     fluctuations), with no signs of deteriorating even amid intense     competition. Apple is the only smartphone manufacturer that     simply chooses not to participate in lower-end pricing     segments.;Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.;9. Especially compared to Android;Rapid commoditization of Android original equipment     manufacturers has led to intense price competition and eroding     prices and profits for the entire Android army. Of course, the     upside of this approach is dramatic gains in unit share --     Android is by far the most dominant mobile platform today.;Data source: KPCB Internet Trends 2016. Chart by author.     Estimates for 2016 as of June 2016.;10. Developers, developers, developers;With the rise of the iPhone, the App Store has grown in     lockstep. Apple announced just last week that it paid out;$20 billion in 2016;to developers, and there are now over 2.2 million apps     available from the repository. Apple often notes that it     has created an entire app economy, and it's not lying.;Data source: Apple. Chart by author.;It's been a great decade for Apple and its shareholders. As     much as investors would enjoy 800% gains from current levels,     it would be too much to ask of the next decade.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Two   competitors that could give PayPal a run for its money is a new   peer to peer (P2P) payment service, ClearXchange, and;Apple;'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) own mobile payment service Apple Pay.;Big banks have an answer for Venmo;ClearXchange is owned by;Bank of America;,;BB&T;,;Capital One Financial;,;JP Morgan Chase;,;PNC Financial Services Group;,;U.S. Bancorp;, and;Wells Fargo;. Some of the top banks in the world are already in the   ClearXchange network and reach over 250 million people.;It is the banks' response to the popularity and growth of   PayPal's P2P payment service, Venmo, which is growing rapidly and   is on pace to process about $20 billion in annual transaction   volume over the next four quarters.;ClearXchange offers a very straightforward and convenient   service. All you need to send someone money is an email address   or mobile phone number. The money is sent directly from the   senders' bank account to the recipients'. Even if someone holds a   bank account not included in the ClearXchange network, they can   still sign up to receive payments.;On top of the convenience of transferring money directly in   and out of bank accounts, the service is fee free. However, Venmo   is also free for all transaction types except credit cards.;While the ability to directly transfer money to and from bank   accounts is attractive, it's not clear whether ClearXchange   differentiates itself enough to persuade Venmo's core users,   millennials, to use it. One reason for the growth of Venmo is   that it is not associated or owned by traditional financial   institutions, an aspect that appeals to a younger generation.   Both PayPal and Venmo users can still send money or pay for goods   even if there is insufficient funds in their account balance,   making these services as easy and convenient to use as   ClearXchange.;Apple has the numbers;Perhaps a more significant elephant to battle against is Apple   Pay. Since Apple Pay's launch in 2014, Apple has been quietly   signing up banks and credit unions worldwide to allow credit and   debit cards to be enrolled in Apple Pay. Recently, Apple added   support for 17 more credit unions and banks bringing the total to   over 1,600 worldwide. Although Apple doesn't disclose specific   numbers, the service seems to be enjoying growing adoption.;In 2016, CEO Tim Cook reported that 75% of all contactless   payments in the U.S. were through Apple Pay.  Apple Pay   transactions increased nearly 500% year over year in the most   recent quarter. More transactions were completed in   September 2016 than the entire fiscal 2015. Apple's major   partners reported that Apple Pay has the highest conversion rate   of any digital wallet, and management expects two-thirds of the   top 100 retailers to support Apple Pay in 2017. Apple Pay   was launched for the Safari web browser for the first time in   September 2016, opening up another avenue for users to engage   with the service.;This success is not surprising. Apple is one of the most   recognized brands in the world and has sold over one billion   iPhones since the launch of the original in 2007, giving Apple a   huge installed base. Of course, some of these purchases are   upgrades for existing users, and some people may not even use an   iPhone anymore.;One analyst estimates the total installed base of Apple's   iPhone is around 400 million. By comparison, PayPal had 192   million active customer accounts at the end of September 2016.   Whatever the exact number for Apple's installed base, it's   reasonable to assume Apple has a potential customer base that   rivals PayPal's.;The important distinction for Apple is its control over both   hardware and software. Since Apple designs the hardware and   software, it can control access to hardware components and   software functionality inside an iPhone. Because of this closed   system, only Apple can program software to access the Near Field   Communication (NFC) chip inside iPhones and Apple Watches. The   NFC chip in an iPhone 6 or later model connects wirelessly to a   NFC chip reader in a retail store, for example, to share payment   data. The NFC chip enables Apple Watch users to simply turn the   crown or wave their wrist in the air, wait for a beep, and,   voila, payment sent. Third-party app developers, such as PayPal,   do not have the luxury of allowing its users to wave their wrists   in the air to send payment.;There's no winner-take-all;Although Apple does not disclose specific operating metrics   for Apple Pay, the statistics CEO Tim Cook discloses on   conference calls are enough to assume Apple's total payment   volume (TPV) is growing along with the mobile payments industry.   The good news for PayPal is that its own TPV has been growing   consistently at 20% or more since the launch of Apple Pay. The   parallel growth of these two services along with the continued   growth of credit card issuers,;Visa;and;MasterCard;, highlights the size of the opportunity for all payment   solutions.;PayPal management puts the company's addressable market at   $100 trillion. Over the last four quarters, PayPal's TPV is $336   billion, so there is a very long runway of growth, not only for   PayPal, but its competitors as well.;10 stocks we like better than PayPal Holdings;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,;Motley Fool Stock Advisor;, has tripled the market.*;David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the;10 best stocks;for investors to buy right now... and PayPal Holdings wasn't     one of them!

Previewing the Q4 Earnings Season;January 09, 2017, 03:39:00 PM EDT;Ahead of the Q4 earnings season ramping up, expectations are for +3.1% growth in S&P 500 earnings on +3.9% revenue growth. This would follow +3.8% growth in earnings and +2.3% growth in revenues for the index in 2016 Q3. The growth in Q3 was the first quarter of positive earnings growth for the S&P 500 index after five back-to-back quarters of earnings declines.;The outlook for the Energy sector has notably improved following gains in;oil prices;, with the sector on track to come out with its first earnings growth in Q4 after 8 quarters of earnings declines. Total Energy sector earnings are expected to be up +17.6% from the same period last year, with the growth trend expected to get even more pronounced in the current and following quarters on the back of easy comparisons and stable oil prices.;For the Technology sector, earnings are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues. Apple (AAPL) remains a drag on the sector's growth pace in Q4 with its expected -6.4% decline in total earnings on essentially flat revenues (revenues are expected to be up+0.3%). Excluding the Apple drag, total Technology sector earnings would up a relatively respectable +7.8% from the year-earlier period on +5.3% higher revenues.;Unlike the Technology sector, growth is expected to be strong from the other major earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index, the Finance sector. The Finance sector has been a strong a performer since the November election, with the Zacks Finance sector up +6.2% since November 8tt (vs. +5.6% gain for the S&P 500 as a whole).;Total Q4 earnings for the Finance sector are expected to be up +10.7% from the same period last year on +2.2% higher revenues. Easy comparisons at AIG (AIG) is a big contributor to the sector's strong Q4 growth expectations. Excluding the AIG contribution, the sector's Q4 earnings growth drops to +5.7%.  You can read more about the sector's earnings picture and the outlook for stock market performance in this article -;Can the Bank Stock Rally Continue?;The pre-announcement period that many companies make use of in lowering market expectations has been relatively quiet this earnings season, which is actually a favorable development. This should add to confidence in expectations for the current and following quarters when growth is expected to notably accelerate. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index for the 2017 Q1 quarter are currently expected to be up +9.3% from the same period last year. Based on history, these Q1 growth expectations should be coming down as companies report 2016 Q4 results and guide lower. But it will be interesting to see if that will happen this time. We didn't see that much negative estimate revisions in the run up to the Q4 earnings season either. Continuation of this favorable trend on the revisions front should help stocks hold on to their post-election gains even if actual Q4 results don't turn out to be that strong.;Confidential from Zacks;"makeArticleAd();";Would you like to access Zacks' 2 best trades that are not available to the public?

Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?;January 09, 2017, 03:31:00 PM EDT;Image: AFP/Getty Images;By now, I think we all know what Uber is, what it does, and how it makes our lives easier. Bought too many groceries? Get an Uber. Too drunk? Get an Uber. Stressful day at work? Uber. Like magic-now, it's really an expectation-any transportation woes vanish with the digital sight of a car heading your way.;Launched only seven years ago,;Uber Technologies Inc.;is an app-based transportation company headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in about 270 cities and more than 60 countries worldwide. Using the app is easy: just type in your current location, where you want to go, and hit request. From there, Uber uses its app to receive its ride requests, sending them out to drivers who transport customers to their final destination.;Increased Competition;The emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.;In addition to the now-defunct Sidecar, companies like Lyft, Curb, Southeast Asia-based Grab, India's Ola, and especially China's Didi Chuxing have all started to eat into the ride-hailing market share, becoming;huge competitors;for Uber. Didi is arguably Uber's biggest threat overseas, and the ride-sharing giant conceded defeat in August,;selling its UberChina operations;to Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies.;Even Alphabet Inc.;GOOGL;"is becoming a threat to Uber, with plans to make its self-driving cars unit a stand-alone business. This initiative could put the company in direct competition with Uber, as the lack of a driver could keep costs down in the long-term. The company's Google division also recently began a pilot program with Waze, a company they acquired in 2013, that enables thousands of San Francisco commuters to join carpools; Waze also offers real-time driving directions based on information from other drivers.";Self-Driving, Uber Style;But Uber is right on Google's heels, and as;self-driving car technology;becomes more commercially available, Uber has been constantly beefing up its business strategies focused on autonomous driving. Back in September, it began testing its self-driving Ford;F;"Fusions in Pittsburgh; engineers rode in the driver's seat, ready to take over whenever things got tricky.";Uber then introduced self-driving Volvo XC90s to San Francisco in December, and riders who requested an uberX were matched with one of these vehicles if one was available. Just days later, however, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for its self-driving cars, as the company didn't have the proper permits.;But Uber being Uber, the fleet of Volvos were on their way to Arizona within days. Uber already operates a self-driving car program in the state, and in 2015, partnered with the University of Arizona to research mapping technology.;Uber also recently acquired car start-up Otto, which specializes in self-driving trucks. Otto is a 90-person company, and its co-founder, Anthony Levandowski, will now lead Uber into the self-driving car market. Impressively, Otto engineers have worked at Tesla Motors;TSLA;, Apple;AAPL;, and Google, and with this knowledge and expertise, Uber is bound to be a top player in the self-driving car industry.;Controversy;While Uber has seen great success, it's journey has been a bumpy one. The company has been in and out of the news thanks to legal and publicity issues in a number of countries. From noncompliance issues in New York City to regulatory concerns and lack of driver background checks, Uber has drawn scrutiny and criticism, and has even been banned in The Netherlands and in parts of Thailand, India, and China.;It's no secret that traditional taxi services are not happy with the rise of Uber and other ride-hailing companies, and many argue that Uber should be subject to the same regulations that they face. In dozens of cities it has moved in to, Uber has faced intense opposition, lobbying, and legal challenges against it from these taxi companies.;Uber has also been embroiled in a;long-standing battle;with its drivers. A group of drivers first sued the company back in 2013, claiming they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. As a result, Uber had been set to pay up to $100 million in reimbursement damages to almost 400,000 drivers, but recently, a federal judge in California ruled that the settlement was unfair.;But as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, and all of the bad press has yet to really negatively affect Uber. Despite;losing over $1 billion;in the first half of 2016, Uber gained just as much revenue in that same time period. Its ability to raise exorbitant amounts of money is incredibly impressive for a company who is less than a decade old, and this skill makes Uber that much more attractive to venture capital investors.;IPO Potential;"Despite these controversies, investors are eagerly awaiting an Uber IPO. Many have believed, or hoped, the company would go public for a few years now, but Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wants ""to make sure [an IPO] happens as late as possible,"" said in an interview with";CNBC;last year.;If and when Uber finally decides to go public, its potential would depend on the broader IPO market and economic environment. According to Renaissance Capital, IPOs only raised a paltry $18.9 billion in 2016, with annual proceeds falling to the lowest level since 2003. Just four companies filed public offerings that grossed over $1 billion.;Looking ahead, it's difficult to pinpoint how busy the IPO market will be this year. Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, music streaming platform Spotify, and other major tech giants have signaled plans to go public in 2017. And recent high-growth IPOs like Twilio Inc.;TWLO;and Nutanix;NTNX;have traded strongly since their debut, a good sign for tech companies everywhere looking to make their trading debut.;How Might Uber Perform?;An IPO for Uber could be massive for both the company and Wall Street. It's currently valued at $68 billion after a total of nine rounds of funding worth $12.9 billion since its launch. And thanks to Uber's structure-a unique combination of transportation company, mobile Internet company, and real world engineering-the company has been touted as one of the best future IPOs.;It's IPO, then, could go either way, but let one number stay in your mind: $68 billion. Let me write that again: $68 billion. This number is a hard one to forget, and a figure that will be on the forefront of many investors' minds come the time of its public offering, as it impressively showcases just how far this startup has come in a few short years.;Stocks that Aren't in the News…Yet;"You are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 10th Birthday Also Marks the End of an Era;January 09, 2017, 01:34:38 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Happy birthday to the iPhone! As difficult as it may be to recall a time when the popular, defining smartphone from;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) wasn't around, it was ten years ago today the Steve Jobs vision for a portable, connected computer became reality.;Source:;via Apple;Even more difficult to recall amongst the iPhone 10th birthday chatter is the fact that the device arguably turned a struggling, so-so company into an icon, and turned AAPL stock into one of the most fruitful investments of the past decade.;"makeArticleAd();";Perhaps most difficult of all, though, is the fact that after seeing what a game-changer the iPhone has been - for the company as well as society - in just ten years, a;mostly disappointing response to the iPhone 7;calls into question the marketability of the upcoming iPhone 8. Some AAPL shareholders are understandably concerned we may not even bother to remember the phone's 20th birthday.;Phone 7 Marks End of Apple's Smartphone Reign;There's no denying the iPhone has earned its stripes. As they say, though, nothing lasts forever. A combination of time, saturation and competition has finally caught up with the iPhone.;7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in     2017;The evidence of this slowdown started to materialize with the response to the iPhone 6s late last year. It was the first iteration of the iPhone that not only;didn't sell as well as its predecessors;, but also the first to see a dropoff in sales in the two quarters following its launch.;Some of the company's staunchest supporters explained that most consumers were holding out for the iPhone 7, which would be a superior device.;Maybe there was some truth to the idea. The same party line is being recycled now, however, with would-be iPhone buyers now reportedly holding out for an iPhone 8. It leads one to wonder if the consumer response to the iPhone 8 will be as lackluster as the response to the iPhone 7 has been, with the bulk of them holding out for what will be the iPhone 8s or the iPhone 9.;And that's when it hits AAPL investors right in the gut… at some point, the company has to sell iPhones right here, right now, and grow those sales as Apple managed to all the way through the iPhone 6.;Perhaps the crux of the problem isn't would-be buyers waiting for the next version. Perhaps most everyone who is going to own any smartphone has a phone they can live with for a while. Perhaps competitors have finally figured out how to make a smartphone that's just as impressive as the iPhone used to be compared to alternatives. As mobile industry consultant;Chetan Sharma observed;:;"""Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores. iPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way, Apple didn't have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away.""";And make no mistake - the iPhone 7 hasn't been flying off the shelves the way it was expected to. Two weeks ago, the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company;cut its planned Q1-2017 production of the iPhone 7 by 10%;compared to iPhone production from a year earlier [production of the iPhone 6s].;Let's also not forget that in September, for the first time in years, Apple unexpectedly opted to not share figures from the first weekend's sales of the iPhone 7. The company said they no longer mattered. Others believed the company simply didn't want to report weaker results.;The iPhone 8 Can't Stop the Inevitable;But can the iPhone 8 turn things around for the company, and relight a fire underneath AAPL stock?;Maybe. The usual supporters are certainly hard at work again, pointing out the;all-glass body, edge-to-edge screen;, and the OLED display. They all seem and sound like improvements to its predecessor. With the exception to the rumored wireless charging though, the rumored specs may well be solutions to problems that don't actually exist.;That has not prevented many people - including analysts - from predicting big things from the iPhone 8.;Nomura Securities, as an example;, believes the iPhone 8 will break all previous iPhone sales records. Just remember, though, it was Nomura that also said demand for the iPhone 7 was;even stronger than it had expected;, and that the supply chain was on the verge of ramping up production of the device. Nomura;raised its price target on AAPL stock;from $120 to $135 in response.;In the meantime, not only have Apple shares not rallied to $135 (or even $120) on the heels of what was supposed to be a big catalyst, we've seen multiple reports suggesting demand for the device was;quickly quelled;.;Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in     2017;Point being, take any optimism surrounding the iPhone 8 with a grain of salt. We've heard it before with the iPhone 7, and it was wrong.;Bottom Line for AAPL Stock;Still, there's no denying the iPhone has earned a spot in the smartphone hall of fame. Though it wasn't the first to develop such a product - that honor belongs to;BlackBerry Ltd;(NASDAQ:;BBRY;) - Apple was the first to make the smartphone a mainstream consumer device, and for years was the name all others aspired to be like.;Nothing lasts forever though. While Apple and the iPhone will both be around for the long haul, the dominance of the iPhone that made AAPL such a great trade is fading. It's unlikely we'll remember to celebrate its advent in January of 2027.;As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.;More From InvestorPlace;"7 ""New Industrial"" Stocks to Bore You to the     Bank";10 of the Worst Values on Wall Street;The post;Apple Inc.

Apple (AAPL) Slashes CEO Tim Cook's Compensation by 15%;January 09, 2017, 09:31:00 AM EDT;Per media reports, declining iPhone sales have resulted in;Apple Inc;AAPL;cutting CEO Tim Cook's compensation. As a result, Cook took home a compensation of $8.7 million in fiscal 2016, down 15% from $10.3 million received in fiscal 2015.;Per media reports, though Cook's base salary increased as much as 50%, his incentive was only 1.79 times the base salary, unlike last year when it was four times as the company met its earnings and revenue goals. Like Cook, several other top executives have been subject to pay cuts as well.;Apple fortunes remain tied to its flagship offering, the iPhone, which at present is facing growth issues. Demand for iPhones has been marred by global macroeconomic weakness due to currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe. In fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone's unit sales were down 5.3% year over year. Sluggish demand is a major concern as iPhone alone contributes about 60% to the company's total revenue.;Additionally, we need to keep in mind that iPhone forms the core of Apple's ecosystem. The company has also been seeing a slowdown in demand from key regions like China, which, if it continues, can significantly impact Apple's financials going ahead. About 63% of Apple's revenues come from the international markets. Moreover, competition from newer devices like Alphabet's;GOOGL;Pixel as well as cheaper smartphones is a major concern.;Apple Inc. Price;Apple Inc. Price;|;Apple Inc. Quote;Reportedly, last year, for the first time in 15 years, Apple reported a year-over-year decline in its revenues. The company's revenues in fiscal 2016 were down 7.7% to $215.6 billion. Per the SEC filing, revenues were 3.7% below the targeted number for the last fiscal year. Given all these factors, Apple's shares have underperformed the broader market over the past one year. Over the past one year, shares of Apple have registered growth of 19.67% compared with the Zacks;Computer Mini;industry's gain of 20.68%.;Even the much hyped Apple watch hasn't been much help. As per an IDC report published last month, sales of the Apple watch tanked 71% year over year to $1.1 million. However, the report added that though sales of the Apple Watch were down, there has been overall growth of 3.1% in the shipment of wearables. This was driven by consumers' preference for simpler wearables, which have seen double-digit growth throughout the third quarter. Also, Apple's decision to launch the Apple Watch Series 2 toward the end of the quarter resulted in lower sales. As growth of the smart watch category remains challenged, Apple's Watch will be up against tough times in the future, added IDC.;Though Apple is working extensively on its other offerings like App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, these are not yet strong enough to lower the company's dependence on the iPhone.;"However, it will be a mistake to underestimate Apple just yet. As per rumors, Apple is planning to launch iPhone 8 next year, on the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. The new iPhone will reportedlyhave unbelievable features including a glass body, a dual-curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor, wireless charging and so on. Analysts expect a surge in demand following the launch of the new iPhone, which is already being dubbed as ""super cycle"".";As far as sales of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is concerned, we expect to gain better visibility when Apple reports quarterly results on Jan 31.;At present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).;A couple of better-ranked stocks in the wider technology space include Veeva Systems Inc.;VEEV;and LivePerson, Inc.;LPSN;.

Monday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and AT&T Inc. (T);January 09, 2017, 09:07:32 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     Tips;U.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street   dithers ahead of a pair of Federal Reserve speeches. Livening up   an otherwise uneventful day economically, Boston Fed President   Eric Rosengren will speak at 9 a.m. Eastern in Hartford, Conn.,   followed by Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart at 12:40 p.m.   Eastern.;It will be a week for speeches, apparently, as Federal Reserve   Chairwoman Janet Yellen will speak at a town-hall meeting in   Washington on Thursday, and President-elect Donald Trump will   hold his first news conference since July is this Wednesday.;"makeArticleAd();";Against this backdrop, futures on the;Dow Jones Industrial Average;are off 0.11% and;S&P 500;futures have slipped 0.07%, while;Nasdaq-100;futures have edged 0.07% higher.;On the options front, volume remained well above average on   Friday with about 16.3 million calls and 14.2 million puts   changing hands on Friday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session   equity put/call volume ratio ticked lower to 0.68, while the   10-day moving average finally moved lower off a four-session   stint at a one-month high to arrive at 0.66.;Turning to Friday's volume leaders,;Facebook Inc;(NASDAQ:;FB;") saw a spike in call option activity despite the stock's 50-day   and 200-day moving averages completing a bearish technical ""death   cross."" Elsewhere, RBC Capital weighted in bullishly on";Nvidia Corporation's;(NASDAQ:;NVDA;) partnership with;Audi;to deliver a self-driving car by 2020, and;AT&T Inc.;(NYSE:;T;) was smacked lower by a reminder that President-elect Donald   Trump doesn't like the;Time Warner Inc;(NYSE:;TWX;) merger deal.;Facebook Inc (FB);FB stock saw its 50-day and 200-day moving averages complete a;"""death cross""";on Friday, a technical formation that is often the harbinger of a   bear market for afflicted stocks. The cross arrives after FB has   shed more than 6.7% in the past two months, with Facebook plagued   by ad reporting issues that could undermine the company's bottom   line. While some technical analysts believe such a cross is more   indicative of prior woes, FB stock traders should keep a close   eye on the shares and any breaches of key support levels - such   as the $115 area for Facebook stock.;Options traders didn't seem too concerned with this technical   development on Friday, however. Total volume for FB stock hit   903,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 67% of the day's take -   well above Facebook's daily average call activity in the 64%-65%   range.;In fact, looking at the week ahead, the Jan. 13 put/call open   interest ratio has fallen to a near-term low of 0.65, with calls   on the verge of doubling puts for the series. In other words,   options traders don't appear too concerns with technical   harbingers, and are looking for FB stock to continue to rebound   in kind.;Nvidia Corporation (NVDA);Red-hot NVDA stock has seen some turbulence since peaking near   $120 late last month. But the shares received a bit of a   sentiment boost during last week's CES keynote address when NVDA   CEO Jen-Hsun Huang announced a partnership with German carmaker   Audi to produce autonomous driving cars by 2020.;RBC Capital weighed in on the news;", reiterating its ""outperform"" rating and speaking favorably on   Nvidia's prospects in 2017.";Short-term NVDA stock options traders remain wary of the   shares, however, given the recent profit-taking purge that saw   the shares shed more than 15.5% from their recent peak. Volume on   Friday came in at 251,000 contracts, with calls only accounting   for 53% of the day's take. In fact, with a total January put/call   OI ratio of 1.39, NVDA options traders have taken a decidedly   protectionist stance on the shares, with attitudes poised to   shift heavily bearish on a breach of support at $100.;AT&T Inc.

Why I’m Staying Away From Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock;January 09, 2017, 08:55:42 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Twilio Inc;(NYSE:;TWLO;) made its official stock market debut over the summer and quickly made money for those who got in early. Twilio stock shot up 195% in its first three months as a public entity, but since hitting that high above $70 back in September, TWLO has been in a downward spiral.;Source:;Web Summit Via Flickr;Some are wondering whether now is the time to scoop up this stock at a steal. Me? I think buying TWLO stock right now would be more like catching a falling knife.;"makeArticleAd();";Let me explain.;Twilio offers application programming interface services that allow developers to quickly and easily add voice, video, text and picture messaging into their applications. There's no question that finds itself in a hot sector, and that there is hope for the company based solely on its business model and industry location.;However, technical analysis of Twilio stock tells a completely different story. And as many of you already know, I believe charts hold the truth.;The stock experienced a big down day last Tuesday and ended up closing at its worst level ever. While TWLO was able to bounce the following two days, it was on about half the volume that we had seen amid the selling. That tells me that this stock is being controlled by the bears at the moment. The light volume amid the two-day rally suggests that it was simply a short-term oversold bounce.;5 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 2017;From here, the chart is clear up to the 50-day moving average (the blue line in the chart below). However, that's where TWLO's latest rally attempt in December failed. It's also worth noting that the 50-day falls very close to $33.07, which is the low Twilio stock hit the week after its IPO (the black horizontal line).;The area between the 50-day moving average and $33.07 will likely prove to be very difficult resistance for TWLO. Should the current trend continue, which I expect it to, we'll likely see the stock fail near the 50-day trend and pull back to a new low in the $24 area.;At this point, I do not believe there is any reason to try to play a short-term rally when the longer-term trend is lower. Until Twilio stock is able to break through its current ceiling, I don't think it's worth buying here.;Matthew McCall is founder and president of Penn Financial   Group, an investment advisory firm.

(NASDAQ:;AAPL;), this day is huge.;Source: Apple;It was exactly a decade ago on this day that Steve Jobs took the stage to unveil the very first iPhone.

Early reviews weren't happy about the idea of a;sealed, non user-replaceable battery;(consumers could easily swap out the dead batteries on other cell phones) and the new iPhone had trouble with slow Edge data service (a new iPhone 3G with faster connectivity wouldn't be available until the following year).;The cost was also prohibitive for a consumer device at $599 - plus monthly carrier plan costs - on contract.;In the U.S., the new iPhone was an;AT&T Inc.;(NYSE:;T;) exclusive, further limiting the potential market. Then, in a controversial move, AAPL dropped the price of the entry-level 8GB model by $200, angering the early adopters.

The large (for the time) color display, touchscreen, user-friendly operating system, Wi-Fi and a built-in web browser hit at just the right time. The arrival of the App Store in 2008 sealed the deal.;Companies that couldn't adjust to the new touchscreen world were left behind.

AAPL Has, Too.;Of course, Apple itself was changed as much as any other company, but in a better way (at least for investors).

How Many iPhones Did Apple Sell in Q1?;January 09, 2017, 07:16:00 AM EDT;With;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) finally forecasting its revenue in Q1 will return   to growth following three quarters of year-over-year declines,   investors will be looking for iPhone sales to help the tech giant   deliver on management's robust outlook when the company reports   its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2017 on   Jan. 31.;Investors have good reason to pay attention to iPhone sales.   With the important product segment accounting for about 60% of   the company's total revenue, iPhone serves as the primary driver   for the company's business. Can first-quarter iPhone sales live   up to expectations and help drive total revenue higher?;"makeArticleAd();";iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.;Returning to growth;In Apple's fourth fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, or the third   calendar quarter of 2016, the company sold 45.5 million iPhones,   driving $28.2 billion of revenue. The quarter's results extended   a streak of year-over-year declines for Apple's largest product   segment. iPhone unit sales were down 5%, and iPhone revenue was   down 13%. The iPhone segment's results were the primary reason   for Apple's 9% year-over-year decline in its total fiscal   fourth-quarter revenue.;But with rosy expectations for the company's latest iPhone,   management importantly guided for total revenue to return to   growth in Q1, expecting the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will help.   Management said it expected first-quarter revenue to be between   $76 billion and $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the   year-ago quarter.;"""[W]e're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and 7   Plus,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the company's fourth-quarter   conference call (via a Seeking Alpha";transcript;).;Beyond the positive initial customer response management saw   for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, management said an improvement in   year-over-year comparisons for iPhone segment revenue and unit   sales in Q4 compared to quarters before it, year-over-year growth   in iPhone sales in 33 of 40 of Apple's markets in Q4, and a   record rate of Android customers switching to iPhone, also played   roles in management's optimistic outlook for the iPhone segment   in the holiday quarter.;So, what should investors expect from iPhone?;"Importantly, Apple CFO Luca Maestri did specifically say he   thought iPhone revenue ""could grow this year"" when asked about   whether he forecast year-over-year iPhone growth in Q1. So,   management is likely expecting iPhone revenue to slightly exceed   the $51.6 billion the segment generated in the first quarter of   fiscal 2016. Therefore, investors may want to use $51.6 billion   as a baseline for forecasting fiscal 2017 first-quarter iPhone   revenue.";Image source: Apple.;However, year-over-year growth in iPhone;unit;sales in Q1 isn't as likely. In Apple's fourth-quarter earnings   call, the company said demand for its larger iPhone 7 Plus   exceeded its expectations. And since iPhone 7 Plus sells for a   higher price than the iPhone 7, this could likely lead to a   higher average selling price for iPhones in the first fiscal   quarter of 2017 compared with the first fiscal quarter of 2016.   Management's optimism for the segment, therefore, could be based   on expectations for higher iPhone revenue growth, but not   necessarily on a forecast for higher iPhone unit sales.;With all this in mind, investors should expect iPhone revenue   to be slightly higher than the $51.6 billion the product line   boasted last year and iPhone unit sales to be slightly lower than   the 74.8 million units the company delivered a year ago.;However many iPhones Apple sells in its first fiscal quarter   of 2017, the more important trend investors may be hoping to get   some insight into when the company reports results is the iPhone   segment's potential for the entire year of 2017. Investors,   therefore, may want to keep an eye out for any forward-looking   commentary from management about how the iPhone segment could   fare this year.

Ignore the iPhone Doom and Gloom Reports;January 08, 2017, 01:25:00 PM EDT;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) faced more than its fair share of gloomy   prognostications during 2016. It's true that the company posted   its first annual earnings decline in over a decade last year, but   Apple still performed well overall, generating more than $45   billion in net income in fiscal 2016.;Japanese financial publication;Nikkei Asian Review;"couldn't resist getting in one more dig at Apple before 2016 was   over. It ran an ""exclusive"" story just before New Year's Day   claiming that Apple would";cut iPhone production by 10%;year over year in the coming quarter. The report said that   despite prior production cuts, demand for the iPhone 7 continued   to miss expectations.;"makeArticleAd();";The dreary predictions about iPhone demand trends continue.   Image source: The Motley Fool.;However, this dour picture isn't supported whatsoever by the   available data on iPhone usage. In fact, adoption trends for   Apple's newest iPhones suggest that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7   Plus -- especially the latter -- have sold very well.;Nikkei;has been pessimistic all along;The;Nikkei Asian Review;has been consistently bearish about the iPhone 7's prospects over   the past year. Way back in May, it said that the iPhone 7 was   dead on arrival due to a lack of innovation.;In August, it reported that there could be supply shortages   for the new models, with component orders down 15% to 20% year   over year. At that time, it maintained its conviction that demand   would decline again relative to the iPhone 6s product cycle. An   October article acknowledged that the iPhone 7 would sell better   than expected a few months earlier, but still called for   declining sales.;Usage data tells another story;If;Nikkei Asian Review;'s sources were accurate, then iPhone sales should have declined   on a year-over-year basis last quarter. That doesn't seem to the   case, though.;On the last day of Apple's first fiscal quarter (Dec. 31), the   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus together accounted for 12.2% of all   iPhone usage,;according to Fiksu;. For comparison, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus represented   12.5% of iPhone usage on the last day of the quarter a year   earlier.;This might appear to imply that sales were down modestly year   over year. However, the iPhone installed base probably grew by   15% to 20% over the past year. As a result, each percentage point   of usage represents a larger number of iPhones.;Bearing this in mind, the Fiksu iPhone adoption figures point   to a low double-digit increase in iPhone sales last quarter.   Mixpanel -- another company that collects iPhone usage data --   estimates even stronger growth for the iPhone 7.;Usage data point to a return to iPhone sales growth last   quarter. Image source: Apple.;It's important to note that these usage figures are a proxy   for sales to end users. By contrast, Apple reports unit   shipments, which also reflects changes in inventory at   third-party retailers. A year ago, Apple significantly increased   its channel inventory, leading to a;painful inventory reduction;later on. The company is working hard to avoid a repeat of that   situation this year.;As a result, even if sell-through is up by double digits year   over year, Apple will likely report a single-digit increase in   iPhone shipments. On the plus side, the lower level of channel   inventory this year will lead to higher shipments over the next   two quarters, all else equal.;Apple could surge past modest investor expectations;In October, Apple projected that its total revenue would be up   0% to 3% year over year in Q1. Based on CEO Tim Cook's comments,   Apple's;ability to ramp up production;of the iPhone 7 Plus to meet customer demand was a key variable   that would impact the company's Q1 results.;After several months of short supply, Apple made big strides   in catching up with demand for the iPhone 7 Plus during the last   few weeks of the quarter. This may mean that iPhone 7 Plus output   came in ahead of Apple's initial expectations. If so, Apple will   probably blow past its revenue guidance range for Q1. The iPhone   7 Plus is also one of Apple's most profitable products, which   bodes well for gross margin.;Right now, analysts on average expect revenue to increase just   2% year over year in Q1 -- well within Apple's guidance range --   and they are calling for EPS to decline on a year-over-year   basis. The slew of negative media reports and weak supply-chain   data appear to have depressed investors' expectations, even   though actual usage trends tell a very different story.;Apple's iPhone lineup appears to have returned to growth last   quarter. Considering that all of last summer's gloomy reports   about iPhone production and sales turned out to be wrong,   investors shouldn't put much stock in the latest negative   headlines.;10 stocks we like better than Apple;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What Snapchat Spectacles and Google Glass Tell Us About the Wearables Market;January 08, 2017, 11:20:00 AM EDT;Image source:;Spectacles.com;.;Google made a lot of noise when it announced Google Glass at   its developers conference in 2012. For its first demonstration,   it had various extreme-sports athletes wear the head-mounted   device while on a live Google Hangout video chat with Google   co-founder Sergey Brin, and it had the tech world buzzing with   anticipation. But within two years of launching the product,   Google shut down Glass.;"makeArticleAd();";Conversely, Snapchat parent company Snap has used guerrilla   marketing tactics to generate strong interest in its Spectacles   -- a pair of sunglasses that double as a camera linked to   Snapchat. The company randomly drops a giant vending machine in a   city, and people line up for hours to get their hands on the $130   device. Others have spent well over the retail price to buy a   secondhand pair online.;Snap has done what the;Alphabet;(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company could not. It has made it   cool to wear technology on your face. While Snap hasn't released   any numbers about Spectacles sales, the above-retail pricing on;eBay;and lines at the vending machines indicates that they're   popular.;But it's not just clever marketing that's made Spectacles a   hit. It's their specificity, and that can tell us a lot about the   rest of the wearables market, too.;What do you do with these things?;Google Glass was a powerful device capable of doing a whole   lot. The biggest problem it faced was that just because it could   do something -- like provide weather data, set reminders, and   dictate texts -- didn't mean people would want to use it for   that. A regular smartphone worked just as well.;Google Glass lacked a specific purpose. Even Google's live   demo at its announcement with the extreme-sports athletes could   have been done better with;GoPro;cameras. Instead, Google provided a platform and asked   developers to come up with a reason you'd want to wear Glass on   your face all the time.;"There's no question why you'd buy a pair of Spectacles. You   want to share more photos and videos with Snapchat's 150 million   daily users; that's all they do.";Spectacles are quicker and easier to use for recording short   snaps, especially while performing actions requiring the use of   both hands or when you want to capture unplanned events in the   moment. Fishing your phone out and loading the Snapchat app can   take a long time. Spectacles are also capable of capturing video   in Snap's new circular video format, which mimics human   perspective.;That specific, limited purpose allows Snap to sell them at an   affordable price point. Spectacles cost just $130 compared to the   $1,500 Google asked for a Glass unit.;The end result is a face wearable that feels more like a toy   than the high-end technology of Google Glass. And that's a good   thing. People buy toys somewhat impulsively, but they consider   their options more carefully when buying a new computer, phone,   television, or other piece of technology. As they should. Those   things generally cost a lot more than toys.;The same principle applies to wrist wearables;This theory also apples to other types of wearables.;Fitbit;(NYSE: FIT) was once again the most popular wearable brand in   2016 and most of its wristbands are considered low-end fitness   trackers. Its average sales price last quarter was $93. That's a   price where consumers are willing to give the product a try and   play around with it. It's a toy.;Comparatively, the;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) Watch starts at $269, with prices climbing above   $1,000. While the device is certainly more powerful than a Fitbit   and has the potential to do a lot more, the best ideas Apple can   come up with for uses are to track your fitness. In fact, its   latest update focused specifically on new fitness-tracking   functionality such as making it waterproof so it can track   swimming activities.;Why would you buy an Apple Watch if all you need is a fitness   tracker? Why would you buy Google Glass when all you want to do   is share videos and photos with your friends? Making a device for   a specific use is not only cheaper, it makes the marketing and   messaging clearer for consumers. That's evidenced in the fact   that fitness bands accounted for 85% of wearable sales last   quarter, according to IDC.;That's the problem Apple currently faces with the Apple Watch.   It can tout all of the technology it's stuffed inside that little   wrist-worn device, but it can't give consumers a reason to buy it   over one of its competitors.;There will surely be a market for Apple's high-end device   simply because of its brand and strong design aesthetic. But   until Apple can provide a differentiating function over its   lower-end competitors, its sales will continue to lag Fitbit and   other low-end device makers. That could be cellular connectivity,   making the devices more independent. It could come from   enterprise support. And Apple has done a good enough job getting   the device onto the wrists of millions that there's relatively   strong developer support. So, it could come from a third-party   application.;10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's How Cirrus Logic Doubled in 2016;January 07, 2017, 03:00:00 PM EDT;Image source: Getty Images.;What happened;Shares of;Cirrus Logic;(NASDAQ: CRUS) doubled in 2016,;according to data from S&P Global Market   Intelligence;. Investors in the audio-processor specialist enjoyed a 96.4%   return in 52 weeks.;"makeArticleAd();";So what;You can't own Cirrus Logic without keeping a close eye on;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Cirrus' largest customer accounted for 66% of   the company's total sales in fiscal year 2016. That's down from   72% in 2015 and 80% in 2014, but Apple remains the core of   Cirrus' business.;So when Apple adds more Cirrus chips to its most popular   product, the chip supplier's top and bottom lines are sure to   turn upward in a hurry. That's exactly what happened in calendar   year 2016, as the iPhone 7 shipped with Cirrus-powered wireless   headphones instead of the traditional 3.5-millimeter headphone   jack.;Thanks to Apple's expanding order volume, Cirrus demolished   sales and earnings targets in the back half of the year.;Share prices;followed suit;in a hurry:;CRUS;data by;YCharts;.;Now what;Here we stand at the start of a new year, with fresh   holiday-quarter reports from both Apple and Cirrus due in a   couple of weeks. Independent reports claim that the Cupertino   company recently slashed its iPhone 7 production volumes in   response to soft demand for the flagship smartphone.;Cirrus fell hard;on that rumor, but also bounced back quickly as investors forgot   about the reported production cuts.;Honestly, owning Cirrus or Apple shares right now would keep   me up at night. Those earnings reports will settle a lot of   questions about the iPhone's trend line, and therefore about   Cirrus' financial future. The company is diversifying to the best   of its ability, but the Apple connection is still tight enough to   add an uncomfortable amount of downside risk. When Apple   stumbles, Cirrus falls -- and it's a long way down from here.;Investors would be wise to hold off on buying Cirrus shares   until we have the holiday numbers in hand.;10 stocks we like better than Cirrus Logic;When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Will Keep Thriving Off Its Strong App Economy;January 07, 2017, 07:30:18 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;It's good to be an app developer for;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;). Last year, the earnings came to a whopping $20 billion, up 40% on a year-over-year basis. In all, there are 2.2 million apps in the App Store. Of course, AAPL stock got a nice benefit from this since the company gets a cut from each download.;Source:;Yuanbin Du Via Flickr;The estimate is that the gross revenues were approximately $8 billion.;"makeArticleAd();";Granted, for a company at the scale of Apple, this may not necessarily seem like a lot. In 2016, the company posted revenues for $215.6 billion. The fact is that the main driver continues to be the iPhone franchise.;Yet, the Apple App Store is still vitally important and it should provide some fuel for growth. Consider that many of the downloads are from highly popular games, such as;Pokemon Go;and;Super Mario Run;.;If anything, as the iPhone gets more sophisticated, this category will likely see continued strong monetization. According to research from;Ovum;, the spending on gaming is forecasted to jump from $38.5 billion in 2016 to $71.5 billion in 2021.;The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' Picks;But then again, the power of the App Store should go well beyond gaming. For example, one driver has been the substantial growth in streaming services, such as;Netflix, Inc.;(NASDAQ:;NFLX;).;AAPL and App Power;Keep in mind that AAPL has been working hard on building its platform. For example, it has a new language, called Swift, which allows for building sophisticated apps.;At the same time, Apple has been developing various app frameworks, such as Healthkit, Homekit, Apple Pay, Sirikit and so on. All these should allow the company to get a piece of the revenue opportunity from the digitization of key industries.;For example, APPL is already making a big play for healthcare. To this end, the company is developing a diagnostic system within Healthkit that will be tied to the Watch.;According to Apple CEO;Tim Cook;": ""If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What's the equivalent for the body?""";The Key to Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Isn't     What You Think;Well, I think APPL wants to provide a solution. And yes, the opportunity is enormous. According to a;report;from Zion Market Research, the mobile health market is expected to go from $11.47 billion in 2014 to $102.4 billion by 2022. Some of the key drivers include better safety, treatments that are more effective and the ubiquity of smartphones. Actually, mHealth is likely to be a key part of helping to reduce the burgeoning healthcare costs in the U.S.;Bottom Line On AAPL Stock;Going into 2017, there are some potential catalysts for AAPL stock. First, it seems likely that Donald Trump will lower taxes on foreign capital. This means Apple will have easier access to its $215 billion hoard that is located offshore. With this, the company will be able to pull off more acquisitions as well as buyback stock and pump up the dividend.;Although, the iPhone will be the key. Unfortunately, the growth has stalled. But this could be the result of consumers anticipating a major update with the iPhone 8. Already there are indications that the device will be standout, such as with OLED (organic light emitting) screens, which will be thinner and perhaps even allow for bending. Interestingly enough, there may not even be a bezel, which will not only make the device look sleeker - one of Apple's hallmarks - but allow more room on the screen.;Besides, AAPL stock still sports a reasonable valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.5X. Hey,;Microsoft Corporation;(NASDAQ:;MSFT;) is at 19X and;Oracle Corporation;(NYSE:;ORCL;) is trading at 14X.;No doubt, Apple stock will not return to the high-growth glory years. AAPL stock is simply too massive. But for 2017, there are certainly some promising factors that should help juice things up.;Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog;IPO Playbook;and is a registered investment adviser representative (you   can;visit his site;to learn more about his financial planning services).;He is also the author of various books on investing like All   About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO   Strategies.;Follow him on Twitter at;@ttaulli;.

Apple's (AAPL) App Store Reports Record Sales for 2016;January 06, 2017, 05:00:00 PM EDT;Apple Inc.;AAPL;recently announced that its App Store generated record sales of more than $20 billion for developers in 2016, up almost 40% from 2015. According to;The Wall Street Journal;, the revenue figure was nearly $28.5 billion and the company collected almost $8.5 billion from these sales compared with roughly $6 million in 2015. Notably, Apple keeps 30% of all App Store sales.;"makeArticleAd();";Apple also stated that the New Year's Day was the busiest day for the App Store with nearly $240 million in sales. During the holiday season (Dec 2016), App Store sales topped $3 billion, which is a record in the company's history. Nintendo's;NTDOY;Super Mario Run was the most downloaded app (40 million downloads in just four days since the games release) globally on Christmas and New Year's Day.;However, Nintendo's another super hit game Pokemon Go took the top spot as the most downloaded app in 2016, trailed by Super Mario Run. Prisma, Reigns, Procreate, Lumino City, Sweat With Kayla and djay Pro were the other most successful games in the App store. Netflix;NFLX;, HBO Now, Line, Tinder and MLB.com At Bat were the top subscribed apps last year. Currently, the App Store offers 2.2 million apps in total.;APPLE INC Price and Consensus;APPLE INC Price and Consensus;|;APPLE INC Quote;App Store Sales: China a Key Driver;The strong sales growth despite lower sales volume of the company's flagship iPhone device reflects the stickiness and superior app offerings of the store. Apple stated that top-grossing markets were the U.S., China, Japan and the U.K. China reported growth of more than 90% year over year.;The Chinese market has proved tough to crack for western services like Apple, Facebook;FB;and Google due to strong competition from local providers and excessive censorship of the government. We note that since Apr 2016, Apple's iBooks and iTunes Movie stores remained blocked in the country.;The App Store has also faced pressure from the Chinese government. Notably, Apple removed both the English-language and Chinese-language apps of The New York Times from its App Store in China on Dec 23 following a request by the government authorities.;"Per Reuters """;The New York Times pointed to a recent investigative report on government subsidies offered to Apple supplier Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precison Industry Co, as a possible reason for the ban.;"""";Although China remains one of Apple's largest iPhone markets, the sales have slumped in recent times. In fiscal 2016, Greater China Sales declined 17% from fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting macro-economic headwinds and tough competition from low cost handset providers. In such a scenario, surge in App Store sales is significantly encouraging for Apple, in our view.;First Retail Store in Seoul;"Meanwhile, the Apple-Samsung rivalry is set to heat-up in South Korea, as the iPhone maker is reportedly planning to open its first retail store in Seoul. According to WSJ, """;One potential location is within a stone's throw of Samsung's longtime headquarters in Gangnam, where Samsung has a three-story global flagship store;".""";Reuters quoted a South Korea's Yonhap News Agency report, which said that Apple's store will be possibly located in a southern district of Seoul and construction work will likely be completed by the end of Nov 2017.;Similar to China, South Korea has proved to be a tough market to penetrate for Apple due to dominance of Samsung and LG in the country's smartphone handset market. However, the company is now banking on its new iPhone to make headway in the Asia's fifth largest economy.;Stock Price Movement;We note that in the past one year, Apple has underperformed the broader market.

The index decreased on Thursday after major retailers registered strong declines.;Last Week's Performance;The Dow declined 0.3% last Friday after investors indulged in profit taking during the final trading session of 2016. Additionally, shares of Apple Inc.;AAPL;decreased 0.8% following reports that the company is reducing production of latest iPhone line by nearly 10% during the ongoing quarter.;The index declined by 0.9%, last week. Light trading and profit booking by investors weighed on stock markets. Moreover, a rise in crude inventories and decline in pending home sales also had a negative impact on investor sentiment.;The Dow advanced 3.3% during December backed by a Trump-led rally. Expectations from Trump's economic policies along with Fed's decision to raise rates in December continued to improve markets.;"Over 2016, the index climbed 13.4%. Markets survived early blues from slowing growth in China's economy as well as the ""Brexit"" which occurred mid of 2016.

Additionally, encouraging manufacturing and construction spending data had a positive impact on investor sentiment. However, some of Tuesday's gains were pared by late decline in;oil prices;, which came on the back of crude production worries. Markets remained closed on Monday.;The index gained 0.3% on Wednesday following encouraging auto sales data and release of Fed minutes. Better-than-expected auto sales data had a positive impact on auto stocks, which in turn boosted the consumer discretionary sector. Moreover, minutes from Fed's Dec. 13-14 meeting indicated that policymakers are in favor of a faster pace of rate hikes this year, which in turn boosted investor sentiment.;The index decreased 0.2% on Thursday after major retailers registered strong declines. Moreover, sector like financials which had benefitted from the back of Trump-led rally took a beating yesterday following uncertainty over some of the new administration's probable economic policies.

Apple Inc. Earnings: Mark Your Calendar;January 06, 2017, 03:31:00 PM EDT;Apple;(NASDAQ: AAPL) will announce the results for its important   holiday quarter on Jan. 31, according to an updated schedule on   the company's website. Investors will undoubtedly be watching the   update closely. Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2017, ending Dec.   31, marked the first full quarter of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus   availability. Will the new iPhone help Apple return to revenue   growth?;Ahead of the earnings release, here's an early look at some of   the key metrics worth looking into.;"makeArticleAd();";iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.;Revenue;Apple's fiscal 2016 marked a rare year-over-year decline in   revenue for the company. Sales during the fiscal year were about   $217 billion, down about 8% from Apple's record $234 billion in   revenue during fiscal 2015. The company's inability to grow its   top line has suppressed the stock's valuation as investors wonder   if Apple can grow from here.;Apple stock;currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14 -- wildly low   for an established market leader as dominant as Apple.;"Still, some investors may be hoping Apple can either turn   revenue around during fiscal 2017 -- or at least put a stop to   top-line declines. Investor hope for a return to growth is   actually encouraged by Apple management; the company guided for   fiscal 2017 first-quarter revenue between $76 and $78 billion,   representing a slight uptick from Apple's $75.9 billion of   revenue in the year-ago quarter.";Investors may be hoping;Samsung;'s recall of its Note 7 during the holiday quarter will serve as   a catalyst for Apple's September-launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.   With Samsung's flagship smartphones clearly standing out as the   biggest competition to Apple's iPhones -- especially in the U.S.   -- the Note 7's recall should have helped drive some incremental   iPhone sales during the quarter. And since iPhone accounts for   about 60% of Apple's total revenue, a solid quarter for iPhone   should make a return to growth more likely.;Earnings per share;"Another key area to watch will be Apple's earnings per share.   But investors shouldn't expect the metric to return to growth the   way revenue could. Even if revenue turns upward, Apple is   expecting a lower gross profit margin in its first quarter than   it sported in the year-ago quarter; a lower gross profit margin   on only a slight uptick in revenue would likely mean EPS for the   quarter will still be lower than in the year-ago quarter.";Apple store. Image source: The Motley Fool.;Apple said it's expecting a gross profit margin between 38%   and 38.5% for its first quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's   gross profit margin was 40.1%.;Importantly, as investors digest the quarter's results,   investors should keep in mind that even if Apple's EPS declines   on a year-over-year basis because of a narrower gross profit   margin, worsening profitability will likely mostly be   attributable to;factors unrelated to Apple's regular   operations;. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin benefited   from a $548 million award for patent infringement. Further,   Apple's guidance for a 38% to 38.5% first-quarter gross profit   margin takes into account expectations for 60 to 70 basis points   of currency headwinds.;Whatever EPS Apple reports, it would likely be worth   investors' time to look for an explanation from management about   what factors drove EPS higher or lower (probably lower) during   the quarter.;For a reference point, the consensus analyst estimates for   Apple's revenue and EPS during the quarter are $77.4 billion and   $3.22, respectively. This would compare to revenue and EPS of   $75.9 billion and $3.28, respectively, in the year-ago   quarter.;Apple will release its first-quarter financial results after   market close on Jan. 31. The results will be available on the   tech giant's investor relations website.

Friday Apple Rumors: APPL May Open New Store in Brooklyn;January 06, 2017, 02:11:30 PM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Leading the;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) rumor mill today is news of a new Apple Store in Brooklyn. Today, we'll look at that and other;Apple Rumors;for Friday.;Source:;Flickr;Brooklyn Store;:;A new rumor claims that AAPL is planning to open a new store in Brooklyn;, reports;AppleInsider;. According to this rumor, the tech company is planning to open a new retail location at 300 Ashland Place in Fort Greene, which is near downtown Brooklyn. This would put the new store near the Atlantic Terminal, which connects New York City and Long Island. This means the new facility would be located in an area with heavy foot traffic.;"makeArticleAd();";iPhone 8 Sales;:;Nomura is expecting the iPhone 8 to surpass sales of the iPhone 6;,;9to5Mac;notes. Nomura is expecting Apple to sell 86 million units of the iPhone 8 2017. The argument is that the iPhone user base grew by 45% to 50% with the launch of the iPhone 6 and 5% to 10% with devices released after that. The analyst expects that iPhone 6 users will be ready to upgrade and the lure of new features in the iPhone 8 will likely help attract them to the new device.;iPhone Prototype;:;A prototype of the original iPhone has shown up online;, reports;MacRumors;". This iPhone prototype is vastly different than the iPhone that we actually got. This includes a different operating system that was called ""Acorn OS."" Unlike iOS, AcornOS worked similar to an iPod Touch. The bottom half of the screen contained an on-screen click wheel that was used to navigate the device's menus. It is amazing that the prototype still exists and functions due to AAPL typically destroying unused prototypes.";Check out more recent;Apple Rumors;or;Subscribe to Apple Rumors;:;RSS;The post;Friday Apple Rumors: APPL May Open New Store in Brooklyn;appeared first on;InvestorPlace;.
Apple Inc. (AAPL) Slashes CEO Tim Cook’s Pay by $1.5M;January 06, 2017, 11:40:03 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook didn't make as much last year as he did in 2015.;Source: Apple;The Apple Inc. CEO earned $8.75 million from the company for the 2016 year. This is made up of a $3 million salary, 5.37 million from non-equity incentive plan compensation and other forms of compensations.;"makeArticleAd();";During the 2015 year, Apple Inc. paid Tim Cook $10.28 million for his services. This included a $2 million salary, $8 million in non-equity incentive plan compensation and some from other forms of compensation.;While Tim Cook's salary at Apple Inc. did increase by $1 million in 2016, he didn't earn as much non-equity incentive plan compensation. This is because AAPL pays its executives this compensation based on the company's performance for the year.;"""Apple was below its target performance goals for both net sales and operating income, resulting in a payout of each named executive officer's annual cash incentive at 89.5% of target,"" Apple Inc. said in a";filing;with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.;This is a change from the last couple of years, which has seen Apple Inc. pay its executives the full 100% of their annual cash incentives. This is most likely due to sales of the iPhone 7 this year. The iPhone line is AAPL's main source of revenue, but;sales were down in 2016;.;Tim Cook isn't going to be strapped for cash just because he didn't earn the maximum pay possible in 2016. The Apple Inc. CEO also has vested stock that was awarded to him this year. 1.26 million shares of his stock vested this year, which holds a total value $136 million.;AAPL stock was up slightly as of Friday morning.;More From InvestorPlace;10 of the Worst Values on Wall Street;5 Stocks to Buy for a Big January;The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New     Year;The post;Apple Inc.

Apple's App Store Sales Exploded in 2016;January 06, 2017, 10:56:15 AM EDT;Consumers spent major cash on Apple's (;AAPL;) App Store in 2016 -- a trend the company expects to continue in 2017. The App Store in December logged its highest-grossing month in its history, generating some $3 billion in revenue.;What does all of this mean for Apple stock? It can finally begin to untether itself from the reliance it has on the up-and-down cycle of iPhone sales. And that's a good thing, given that the company has reportedly lowered production of the iPhone 7 by 10%. I'll get to that in a moment. For now, with;The Telegraph estimating;almost $30 billion spent on apps, Apple's income is becoming more diversified.;On Thursday the Cupertino-based tech giant disclosed its App Store experienced a 40% year-over-year surge in revenue in 2016. Apple says on New Year's day alone, customers spent nearly $240 million on apps and in-app purchases, marking the App Store's largest single-day of sales ever.;"makeArticleAd();";"""2016 was a record-shattering year for the App Store,"" said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in a";statement;.;Between in-app purchases on Madden football, Jurassic World, Deer Hunter and Rollercoaster Tycoon, my household contributed to about $65 of those New Year's day sales. You're welcome, Apple. According to Apple's website, app developers typically receive 70% of sales revenue, while Apple takes a 30% cut.;The company also enjoyed a 74% surge in billings from subscription services like Netflix (;NFLX;), popular dating app Tinder and Time Warner's (;TWX;) HBO Now, reaching to $2.7 billion. Among the App Store's more than 2 million offerings, Apple said Pokemon Go was the most downloaded app. The recently released Super Mario Run, not surprisingly, ranked in the top 10 of most downloaded apps.;The significance of all of this? As Apple's iPhone sales have slowed, suffering its first year-over-year decline last year since its inception in 2007, Apple has increasingly emphasized the cash flowing in from its Services division. The Services business, which includes the App Store, revenues from Apple Pay and Apple Music, rose 24% in the most-recent quarter, posting revenue of $6.3 billion.;Apple has also begun to restructure its business to create a separate Cloud Services segment. The more diversified Apple becomes, the less fearful investors will be about declining iPhone revenue. And to the extent the services business can continue to grow at 20%+ rates, Apple shares -- currently priced at 13 times forward earnings vs. 18 for the S&P 500 Index -- could command a higher multiple. With Apple shares now trading at around $116, a $145 target -- on the strength of its services -- seems more than realistic.
Boring Is Good for AT&T Inc. (T) Stock;January 06, 2017, 10:24:43 AM EDT;InvestorPlace;InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips;The Donald Trump rally has certainly been awesome, but markets tend to get carried away, leaving us with a lot of questions. Mainly, are there stocks out there that can withstand the turbulence? I think a good choice is;AT&T Inc.;(NYSE:;T;);Source:;Mike Mozart via Flickr;Investors may have already factored in much of the potential for lower taxes and regulations.;"makeArticleAd();";And besides, there are still lots of risks swirling around - such as the impact of the soaring dollar or the possibility of a global trade war. Heck, perhaps Trump could cause some type of geopolitical incident through his prolific use;Twitter Inc;(NYSE:;TWTR;) alone!;Granted, it's all speculation … But this is why it is reasonable to get a bit more conservative with investing. Let's face it, a correction can come quickly. Just look at what happened this time last year.;The Case for AT&T Stock;After all, the company has been around for over 130 years. The AT&T stock dividend yield is also a juicy 4.7%, and the company has increased the payout for an impressive 32 consecutive years!;5 Stocks to Buy for a Big January;Now it's true that T stock has its issues: The debt load will hit a burdensome $170 billion after the acquisition of;Time Warner Inc;(NYSE:;TWX;). Oh, and by the way, this deal has its own inherent risks. For the most part, the entertainment business is volatile and there can be long dry spells.;However, megadeals usually have hiccups. The key is whether management has the ability to manage through them. The good news is that AT&T has been fairly disciplined with its dealmaking. It is also encouraging that the company is willing to take some bold moves.;For example, AT&T has built a next-generation streaming service with its DirecTV deal. The monthly subscriptions start at an introductory $35 a month (moving up to $60 after the offer ends) - which should be attractive to cord cutters - and there are over 100 channels from premium content providers like;Walt Disney Co;(NYSE:;DIS;) and TWX. The service is also multi-platform, with availability on smartphones,;Apple Inc.;(NASDAQ:;AAPL;) TV and;Amazon.com, Inc.'s;(NASDAQ:;AMZN;) Fire TV.;So far, there have been;glitches with the services;. This shouldn't come as a surprise. If anything, it looks like demand has actually been strong (the sales targets were hit in a single day) and this may be making it difficult to handle the heavy volumes. In fact, the success of the service is probably an important factor in the end-of-year rally for AT&T stock.;Bottom Line on AT&T Stock;Yet the main attraction of AT&T stock is the;recurring revenues;. Consider that there 79.4 million business wireless subscribers, 53.9 million consumer wireless subscribers and 25.3 million video subscribers. More importantly, AT&T has the benefit of a powerful moat - that is, a nationwide fiber optic network. Replicating this would be incredibly expensive.;As a result, AT&T stock has produced consistent financials. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 4.6% to $40.9 billion and operating income increased by 8.2%. Cash from operations also came to a hefty $11 billion.;Should I Buy Amazon (AMZN) Stock? 3 Pros, 3     Cons;Finally, AT&T stock is trading at a reasonable valuation, with forward price-earnings ratio at about 14. By comparison,;Comcast Corporation;(NASDAQ:;CMCSA;) trades at 18 times projected earnings and;Dish;Network Corp;(NASDAQ:;DISH;) sports a multiple of 23.;But again, for investors looking for a relatively stable play, AT&T stock does fit the bill - especially given its large base of subscribers and attractive dividend yield.
